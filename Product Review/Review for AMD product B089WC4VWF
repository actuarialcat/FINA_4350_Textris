Works well. Good quality
Honestly, for my first time going on PC, I would recommend this CPU if you have the extra money to spend. I matched mine with a MSI GTX 1660 super and I'm running 90-100FPS on warzone on high settings. Drops to 80-90 while recording.
It’s does the job.

Bought this for my son's pc and i worked great as expected. AMD is doing a really good job,
Finally upgraded from my FX-8350 8 core (really 4 core) machine. WOW! This thing is fast. I'm not a gamer, so I wasn't interested in a high end (and high dollar) processor, however, it is worth spending a little more than basic money to get the Ryzen 5 3600XT. Performance is excellent. Benchmarked ad 98% plus. Now... if it'll give me six years of flawless performance like my last AMD build did, I'll be happy.
The initial CPU I bought arrived damaged, but Amazon deserves a ton of kudos for getting me a replacement within just a few hours.For the price, this CPU is really fast and doesn't run nearly as hot as other overclocked processors I've used before. I would definitely recommend.
Have her in a X570 Tuf with a Hyper 212 Black at 4.5ghz @ 1.4v. Rock solid and worth the money over the 3600 if you’re into overclocking.

With Intel being basically out of the races this gen and the Ryzen 7 being such a giant price leap, this was the best bang for the buck CPU I could find. Even when streaming, playing games, and running adobe programs all at once, this thing almost never peaks.
