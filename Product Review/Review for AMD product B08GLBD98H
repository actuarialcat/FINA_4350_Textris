I bought this to replace the stock cooler that originally came with one of my CPUs (i7-6770) that I recently repurposed for a different build.It is a bit smaller than I expected, but still works really well at reducing CPU core temperatures while staying nice and quiet (even with the dual fans).It was really easy to install, and looks great in my case (with transparent side panel), even though it is only blue instead of RGB.I love that it even comes with a small tube of thermal paste along with various brackets and clips for a variety of CPU sockets.Does everything I wanted.
