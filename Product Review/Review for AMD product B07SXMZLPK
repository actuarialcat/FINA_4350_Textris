Could it be faster? Yes. Is it worth spending an extra $200? Not in my opinion. This thing is plennntyyy fast. I've been using it for a few months now with no crashes or any issues whatsoever. I have a nice and snappy PC. If you're on the fence just go for it. And I got Valhalla for free so, thanks AMD
The chip is a beast. Not much more that needs to be said
Able to run all your favorite games easily but also doesn‚Äôt overheat. You won‚Äôt ever get spikes because this processor is very stable.
Great processor for the price
This cpu is just amazing. Amazing gaming performance it can be paired with any gpu to get the maximum fps possible without bottlenecking the system. It is also super easy to cool for super easy to cool with the stock cooler or if your building a small form factor pc.
This CPU is great, nothing but love for it. Not very hot, and it runs everything I need with no problem. Pair this with at least 16gb of fast ram and you got yourself a great combo for a high value workstation.
Installed on MSI B350 MATE board (REQUIRES BETA BIOS, so make sure you have your old Ryzen to do the BIOS upgrade). Upgraded from a Ryzen 1700X and the difference is quite noticeable.Worked great. The stock cooler is somewhat loud on ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù (H), I haven‚Äôt switched it to ‚ÄúLow‚Äù (L) yet. I used Arctic Silver as thermal paste.
This 8 core, 16 thread CPU performs fantastically when it comes to productivity applications like Adobe CC, Blender, and Unreal. It was a large upgrade for me, coming from an i5 chip on a laptop. It's quite fast for renders and video exports. So far, very solid and no complaints. The price for this kind of performance is also quite reasonable.
Fantastic processor for gaming. One of the best and affordable
Really hope this one still works! Because this is the second prosser i have got. the first was DOA!!! This is ridiculous üòí.
