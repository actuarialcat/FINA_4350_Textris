Awesome CPU. Well worth the money. Absolutely no downfalls as of yet. Can't beat the price to performance.
First pc build and the 3600x is a good deal for gaming and/or streaming/editing
It’s great the little bit bigger cooler helps also it’s a huge upgrade for me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants the beast amount of performance for the price.
Very worth the cost, one of the best CPU's i've used on a budget.
Paired this with an A520 board for a budget build. Works amazing and hit rated clocks out of the box. Used 3200Mhz ram and this made for a smooth experience. Definitely recommend this combo to anyone looking for entry-level board and CPU combo
I'm cooling this with a Noctua NH-U14S. This card performs perfectly for 1080p and 4k gaming. Really couldn't ask for a better value for the money.
works perfectly. if you're buying this you've probably already researched your other options as well.
The 3600 was out of stock so had to pay more for the 3600x.I have one of each and side by side benchmarks are almost identical.Maybe a 1% increase with the 3600x.So save some money and get the 3600 without the X, you won't notice a difference.
I needed to update my processor as my son is into gaming.I read great reviews about AMD so I upgraded to an AMD Ryzen 3 3600X CPU from my old Intel i5-4690K. I found Gigabyte B550 AORUS Elite for the motherboard.Including a cooler is a huge plus!The cooler has thermal paste already on it so no need to have some unless you take the cooler off the CPU.Installing the CPU and RAM were easy. Just make sure the CPU arm is fully opened before inserting the processor.With the Ryzen 3 cooler, I did have to remove the cooler attachment that was already on the motherboard.I don't need to do any benchmarking because I know this is a huge improvement over my old Intel.For the price, this is a great processor.I was an Intel fan but AMD is beating Intel.
