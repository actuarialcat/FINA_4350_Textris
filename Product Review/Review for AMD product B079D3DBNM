Great CPU. It is cheap ( I got it for $~80), and so is perfect for budget builds. It is not very powerful in any aspects, the Vega 8 or the CPU itself, however it did handle games. It handles fortnite on low at about 30-40 fps 1080p, and valorant on high at 60 fps. I would recommend on black friday picking up a 2700x or 3600 x or xt and a proper GPU as it will greatly increase performance.
AMD APU’s have come along way. I used the 2200g for my daughters PC. It does everything a 12 year old girl could want it to. I’m really surprised that these didn’t catch on with consumers more. These would be perfect in An OEM as long as gaming wasn’t a concern. Even then you could get a cheap rx 570 and have yourself a better1080p gaming PC. For everyday use, Ryzen APU’s can’t be beat for the price to performance you get. A newer version would be better, I’m upgrading my daughters to a 3400g for Christmas.
Excellent
It's been about 4 years since I installed this CPU and wow this sucker works great. It is so powerful and seems limitless for what I am working with. I really love it
This product is very good. I like it very much
Great for entry lvl or si Ole workstation with esport gaming
I use this CPU in the mini case, with 1650 super GPU. The temperature stay on 45 to 60 degrees when I play OverWatch. And it can run OverWatch with 120 FPS in midden set. But when I playing the Death Stranding in low set, it can't even stay at 60 FPS.
After about 1 month of usage, the processor died and has not been working at all, but it was an amazing time with it while it was working.
If you're looking to build a PC as a newbie I would definitely recommend starting with a component like this.
this is what dream's are made of, this is how you get a new generation into pc gaming
