It is what it is. I’ve never received a flawed intel cpu and I’ve built PCs with them since the 8088. They seem to get easier to install all the time. The notches make it nearly fool proof. I’m not a gamer, I have no need to push the limits. I boot up the new build and it’s been running constantly for 2 wks now without any hiccups. My gen 2 i5 was showing its age, but still runs ok. Just going into retirement I figured I’d build a new desktop while I can afford it. I expect it may be the last pc I’ll need to build since my needs are pretty basic. I probably could have gone with a lower level cpu but I expect this will carry me forward a bit further.
Running great! Love Intel processors
Llegó en perfecto estado y mucho antes del tiempo, no lo he probado pero se ve que está en buen estado
Llego justo lo que pedí, 5 dias después de realizar la compra, no pensé que fuera tan rapido!!! Una excelente inversión para PC Gaming!!
I would say this is the most bang for your bucks in Oct 2020. Gaming-wise, definitely good for 1080p at 144hz pairing up with rtx 1660 super. For people who wants an intel processor for a budget build, this would be it.
Especialmente la compré solo para video juegos y no tengo ninguna queja.
Excelente producto
Compared to the direct competitor from AMD, the Ryzen 5 3900, the Intel CPU is $20 cheaper and has a 3% overall more effective speed. Also, the ITX motherboards utilizing the LGA 1200 chipset seemed much better valued as well. I got a ROG Strix motherboard which would've cost $50 more if I wanted it with an AM4 chipset.
