No trouble loading basic things and downloading stuff.
A good product.It won’t win any awards for speed but is a good middle tier processor for general use and light to moderate gaming.
Get something better you won’t want this unless you’re running an office computer
Everyone knows that Intel's Pentium Gold and Celeron chips are just rebinned variants of their more expensive products. In other words, this is just a Coffee Lake Core i3/i5/i7 with bad cores and cache sized down to a Dual Core CPU with hyper threading.In other words, don't expect this to be on par with any of their other offerings of the same generation. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that underlying microarchitecture is the same as their other chips so you'll see solid performance under moderate workloads. It wont be top tier but it will do the job.How do I use this CPU? In an ESXi host, and it does quite well! I'm running four to five virtual machines and a time and it has no problem staying responsive and cool.
A bit underpowered, even for the price.Struggles with even moderate with loads.Ended up exchanging for an i3 and quite a bit happier with that.
Good processor, great value for the price and plays games really good , j’d recomend
works very well!!
I actually using this product for a personal nas server. The processor is great for its purpose.
One of the best CPUs on the market as of this writing.Con - fan is somewhat noisy.
