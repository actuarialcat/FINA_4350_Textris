Good speed and great for over clocking. Gaming is smooth and glitch free. Stays cool and performs well.
This makes an amazing processor for budget builds and mild overclocking. Performs with games like doom eternal and for a horizon 4 with no issues. Great for gaming but thatâ€™s about it I still recommend a ryzen cpu however as one at this price will perform way better.
Great product and fast delivery
First install BIOS has temp checks and output was pleasantly surprised. 60c at idle. Great processor for budget price.P.S. dont buy a fan if yo buy this it comes with a heatsing/fan with thermal paste already on it
When paired with a decent GPU this CPU can run AAA titles at 100+ fps no problem, I personally like the auto boost feature where under pressure it will boost click up to 4.2 ghz
Works amazing, would definitely buy this product again!!!
Si quieres empezar o armar una pc de entrada ya no compres un i3, escoge este i5
Working well so far. Mine came with a CPU cooler fan (that I didn't end up using), that does already have thermal paste applied on it so you don't have to do it yourself.
Works well for gaming and is a beast for office products.
Easy to install, but I think the one i received was defective. Made clicking noise like it the cooling fan was hitting something constantly. Would short out in 3 different motherboard setups I tried. Will be sending back and buying a different generation.
