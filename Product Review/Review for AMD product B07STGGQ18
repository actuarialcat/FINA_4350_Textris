it does an amazing job and good cooler
Hopefully it’s not damaged ... I just receive it and the box is all banged and the seal is broken
el mejor procesador calidad precio para multitareas q esta en el mercado , muy contento con el producto , gaming , streaming , diseño grafico hasta el momento nada le a queda grande , muy contento con el producto
I bought this CPU when it was at $150 and I have had absolutely no problems with it. I can use it perfectly for streaming, editing videos or photos, and just plain gaming. It matches perfectly with my B550 Motherboard and my 2060 KO. Would definitely recommend this!
This is awful
Can be overclocked to 4ghz with stock cooler, above you will/may need an aftermarket cooler. Very stable.You can get better AMD processors especially the new ones, but this met my needs for what I wanted to do and need it for.
Es perfecto para jugar, lo único malo es que las temperaturas con el disipador de stock son algo elevadas
I have been running this for a little while now and have been very pleased with the results. I use this chip for a combination of gaming, programming, and running virtual machines and it has blown me away. Before this I was using an old i5 3570K that I had overclocked pretty substantially (4.5GHz up from 3.4GHz) and one of the first tests I ran was Cinebench R20. I was expecting a big jump, but not a literal 3 times score increase.I will say that while I absolutely do not regret my purchase, if I were in the market for a new CPU now, I would probably wait just a little bit, spend a little more, and get one of the new Zen 3 based Ryzen 5000 chips, although if you cannot wait for one of those or spend the extra money, this chip will absolutely leave you satisfied.
Best 6 core affordable processor.
Excelente para gamer
