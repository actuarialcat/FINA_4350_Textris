Great cpu for the price. Only reason I bought it was because the mobo I purchased only took 7th gen cpus and for some reason the ram wont run max speeds with anything 6th gen.
Good performance
Genuine Intel. Use this in my media server that runs 24/7. Never had an issue.
if you can build 8th or 9th gen, go that route instead. Also consider the i3-9100f CPU
Be careful not to bend the pins on you CPU socket when you install the processor...
Little pricy but works fine
I upgraded from an intel pentium g4400 and i can hardly notice the difference between the two, if you are getting this for gaming i would advice getting a quad-core CPU
This little processor is a great start for anyone looking to game. I run Flight Simulator X, American Truck Sim, Sim City 4, The Sims 3, and GTA V along with streaming to youtube with OBS. I am using a gt 1030 grapics card along with 8gb ddr4 ram. This little thing excesed expectations.
During the mining craze, I also hoped on board. To get the job done, I purchased this CPU for my rig. I've had zero issues with it and give it an over high rating based on its capacity to run Windows or Linux smoothly, installed easily, and came with the required hardware (fan included). Very pleased - NOT for gaming PC's :)
The problem with this isn’t a problem with cpu itself it’s fine, the problem is for 80$ you can get a pentium gold that’s more powerful. If I had known that at the time I would have got the pentium but this is powerful enough for my gaming rig.
