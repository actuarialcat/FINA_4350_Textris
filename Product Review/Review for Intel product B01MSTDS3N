I got the wrong processor, number and Ghz does not match description
It's a great i5 processor that is easy on the wallet but offers the best bang for the buck in my opinion and is a must if you are using a graphics card in the GTX 1070 and above range. Anything less and you really start to bottleneck the graphics card.
all core's full steam ahead. Gaming with a smile.
Got this for running home made router. Runs smooth, overkill for my needs so far. Built in graphics work great, standard installation on a MB. Not overclocking, just need consistent running. Intel is good as usual.
Hapoo po u with item
I used this Core i5 processor to upgrade my HP Omen 870-210 from an outdated dual core i3 processor, and it works great. The only issue I really had was attempting to install the stock fan. It came with some weird plastic snap in screws that I couldn't manage to figure out. There is a small manual but it's just pictures with very little explanation, so I used a different fan and heat sink. I'd recommend buying a separate fan for this one. It's running great though. I couldn't be happier.
Question:
The Amazon store page clearly says this clocks in at 3.5ghz but the product is actually only 3.0ghz. it is a working processor but not as good as it was advertised to be. It also came with no thermal paste for me to apply.
I bought a few of these to make PCs for my employees to take home so they could work remotely.Works fine.Mid range of desktop processors.
