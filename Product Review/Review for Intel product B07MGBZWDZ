A solid and noticeable upgrade for 8700k users on either a z370 or z390 mobo. Better gaming and multi app performance, as well as streaming from a one PC setup.
Upgraded from an I7 8700 and cant wait to put it through it's paces video editing.I'm thus far quite please with my purchase.
Beautifully fast, coming from first generation quad core i7.This is very nice. And seller I highly recommend.
I upgraded from an I5 9600k to the I9 9900k and I couldnt be happier, every game I trow at it runs perfectly no more micro stutters, I would recommend it 100% Buyer beware if you dont have a dedicated graphics card dont buy this processorTemps are around 60 c while gaming Im using a corsair H100i to cool this processor
The CPU box was shipped inside an envelope and the box was half destroyed when I got it. Don't seem to be having any problems with the CPU so far, but you'd think for a $400 CPU that they would at least ship it properly.
Website advertised Intel i9 5.0GHZ, but the item I received is Intel i9 3.6GHZ, cannot return. This is terrible!
Great performance, but too expensive when lined up against comparable AMDs. This will be my last Intel build unless the company brings hyperthreading back to i7.
Item was DOA. Already returned
Whoever supplying this real sus, but I decided to roll the dice and got the real thing.Speeds are about average for a 9900kf, no complaints.
Love the CPU, I did get a defective CPU the first time around but Amazon sent out a replacement no problem. Just be warned, Amazon doesn't accept returns for this particular CPU, so you more than likely won't get your money back if you end up having an issue as I did, a replacement is the best they can do (which I'm not complaining). Anyway, the processor itself is fantastic and you won't need to upgrade for a good while with it. Running multiple applications while gaming is a breeze for this CPU.
