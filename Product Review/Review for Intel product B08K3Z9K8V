Itâ€™s a nice budget board but not great for over clocking, I do like it for its Asthetics!
Ok
Very good much better then intel I5
Great looking mobo and good CPU.Great value especially if like me you are wanting to reuse intel CPU blocks.AI overclocking gets up to 4.9 GHz on all cores.Only negative for me is the lack of ARGB headers.
It was easy to install and exactly what I need. Came super fast and everything was perfect!
I bought this bundle for my gaming setup, and it turned out to be nice! My only issue is that u was unable to setup my radiator at the top of my case because of clearance.
So far this was a good purchase for the price.The processor is an OEM processor so not in a retail box.Paired with the Asus Prime main board I can say so far so good. I used it to replace my older i7-4790K and Asus Sabertooth z97 main board and I can definitely feel a difference.Multiform processing is solid at stable overstock speeds set by Asus Ai, the Air automation is pretty good, although expect a few crashes while it determines the optimal settings for your processor. Having a liquid cooler is also good idea for this combo, the new Corsair h100i RGB capellix cooler is a good choice and keeps my setup at 31-41 degrees Celsius depending on load.Aura Synce works ok, but has some quirks with various lighting controllers, seems to link with corsair iCUE, so thats a plus.Overall I am happy with this combo purchase and have had no issues
