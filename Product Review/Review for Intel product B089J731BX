I liked it so much I had to buy another one. They are super fast. Paired with a liquid cooler they can be OC'd pretty high. Even while playing modern games, it's barely even being used. It has so much power! It is a bit pricy but I highly recommend it. You know how the saying goes, "ya get what ya pay for."
I use it mainly for Call of Duty: Warzone and as soon as you turn on your PC you can feel the difference against an i5 9600k.
Perfect high end for gaming
This cpu shreds anything I throw at it. The most demanding games only hit it to about half load. My cpu was able to hit 5.2 on a simple AIO. Insanely high perfomance.
Iâ€™m upgrading from a i7-9700f with a rtx 2070 super as an Example on COD Warzone I had to everything on low graphics with low FPS to not burn out the cpu. NOW I am able to run everything on ultra setting with over 200 FPS while having other apps opened in the background and the cpu usage is not even on half. I am way more then impressed with this cpu
