Good
For it’s price it definitely performs outstanding and would recommend it. Just make sure you’re motherboard has an am4 socket before buying but would recommend for a budget build
Very happy with it.
If you can't afford Intel CPUs, AMD is the way to go all the way. My father needed an upgrade to play some newer games better than what he was playing before. I personally do not like DDR4 memory like this CPU as I prefer DDR3. The photo shows the parts we needed to complete this build including this product.
Lo mejor que existe para jugar y trabajar
Really powerful.Doesn't get too hot with the stock cooler and is great at multi tasking.
Overclocked it right out of the box it's stable with a water cooler runs all my games perfectly great cpu
Yo la estoy usando con Proxmox y funciona muy bien tengo corriendo 12 máquinas virtuales Ubuntu 12.04 y cero fallosy eso que estan uniendose todos los dias unas 12 horas
Works really fine, the component is fast enought for me. NEver got to 100% usage nor got high temperatures so far
The cpu is fine but i had to under clock my ram so my computer didn't crash. It took mt 5 days after building my pc that i needed to lower my ram speed which is weird for amd cpu they usually want ram that is faster
