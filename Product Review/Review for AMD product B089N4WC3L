If you compare features, this is a very nice computer for this price range - it works well as a "general-use family PC". It's quicker than I thought it would be, but if you're looking for a gaming computer, I don't think this is the one for you.
Very nice and great price
Better than I had expected.The Ryzen 5 is quick and performs multi-tasking with ease.Many reviews said the stand was less than desireable, but, I found it to be very solid and the monitor straight.You won't be disappointed.
If the stand for the monitor was more flexible or even removable, I'd give this 5 stars.It's incredibly fast and quiet. I've been using it for about 1 month now and it's my favorite computer ever (out of countless desktops and laptops over the years).
I don't need a heavy duty PC for whatI do so this unit appears to do what I want which is web access, and a few programs. I don't use the camera and do not use it for gaming. Display is sharp and clear and seems to process data fairly quickly
The computer that does not take up space
Elegant design, very fast, excellent for working and having fun surfing the internet or playing games
I'm very satisfied for the price/performance.The screen is a lower quality than my old aio desktop, but so far this is cheap and performs well.Recommend.
i very much like the simplicity of the all in one system And especially the larger screen.
I liked that this computer takes so little room on my desk. I got a wireless mouse and keyboard and I love it!!
