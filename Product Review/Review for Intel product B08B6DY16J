I gave this 1 star not because the product isn't working well for my average use, it is, however, I chose this over others because of it's advertised backlit keyboard which doesn't seem to exist. I've contacted the seller and have not received a response which is why I am only rating this as a 1 star. If any other questions come up I don't feel confident that I will receive a response from the seller who gladly accepted my money for this obviously without regard to me the customer
So far so good. Easy to set up. Bought for my elderly parent who keeps lots of tabs open. Hasnâ€™t locked down yet. I think the price is good for a refurbished HP.
Perfect for every day use.My wife loves it and so do I.I'm buying another one.
