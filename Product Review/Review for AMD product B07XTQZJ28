Excellent processor, I really love it, no complaints so far, it has not giving me any heat problems whatsoever.Unless you don't have a graphics card (this does not have an integrated one) there is no reason not to buy.
Great product but it was originally $85. I do know AMD raised the price at one point to around $120 if I'm not mistaken, but DO NOT buy at its current price of $250. Wouldn't pay over $150 for it. If price changes to something appropriate disregard this review.
Fast, super fast
good price and quality , durable, easy to use, value for money
Good for streaming and gaming it is better than what intel has for the price.
When this product sold for the AMD asking price of $85 dollars new it could not be beat - It has performed and performed and performed again - the AF version is the 12nm refresh and everything you could dream of with regard to value for money - hopefully amazon will restock once all the plandemic is over - 10/10 recommend
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. For what this CPU costs it's a steal for anyone looking to get into gaming and try out Ryzen.This runs on the Zen+ 2nd gen architecture (basically a 2600 but downclocked)If you're into content creation such as YouTube or any image editing, as well as gaming it's a good startup option for sure.if you only want to game a Ryzen 3 3300X is great too.But anyway this little guy runs all my games paired with a GTX 1060 6GB and 16GB of RAM with ease at high to max settings.Great power at a great price and that's pretty much all that needs to be said.Edit: it also seems amazon can't handle 1080p 60fps game clips Lol
It’s good
Great cpu runs like a champ
They sent me the 2600 which from what I read is better but still kind of disheartening. Not sure if I should rate it really high or low but the cpu does great ahaha.
