I had Z170 gaming motherboard with i3 6100 CPU. Decided to buy this CPU instead of going for new generation CPU and buying new mobo. For now, CPU works perfectly.
Is good
This was the CPU I got for my very first built system about two years ago.What can I say, is really reliable and I had zero problems with it on my Gigabyte MB.it does what is supposed to do.At this point in time this CPU is a bit over priced though.By the way, I never over clocked this CPU so I should have got the non K version.
I didn't try to overclock it when i purchased, but once i tried to i found out that i was sent the locked version of the processor. (not the K version)
4Ghz Skylake goodness.Works great and as expected.
Have been using for 4 years. Still works great
Wanted to boost my pc's performance a bit. I figured this would be a cheaper alternative than replacing my entire pc. Easy to install, and noticeable difference in performance. worth the price if your at this current generation of cpu (theres obviously much better, faster, and cheaper cpu's that fit more modern/recent platforms)
Good
Box was indeed new, i have tried seeing it works yet but as far as i can see from the condition of the CPU and box it looks untouched
Ya lo instale hoy 21 de julio del 2020 y espero que no suceda nada durante el proceso.
