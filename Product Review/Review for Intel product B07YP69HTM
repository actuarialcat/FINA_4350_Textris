It works great
Updated the CPU for my X299 motherboard for the last time.Hopefully, Intel will update the motherboard chipset for enthusiasts soon to support PCIe 4.0 and faster RAM; then I will have to consider buying a new motherboard.Not sure what they mean by "Easy to Lock"...????
Love it. Fast, reliable and damn this thing can be overclocked!Runs below 30°C with the "DeepCool Castle 360EX" and stays below 60°C while gaming running with the XMP profile of the memory.
I upgraded from a 3rd gen i5 to this product.Looking back, I wish I would have taken a closer look at AMD's lineup of products.Based on the research I have done, it seems that they have processors that will give you nearly identical single threaded performance.Many of their processors also have more throughput.You can get all of this for about half the price.So, you can go with this product for an insignificant gain in in single threaded performance.But you are going to have to pay about double for it.I'm not convinced it was worth it.
Seems pretty rock solid and miles ahead of my 7th gen i7. Loving it so far and booted up like a champ.
Liked it very much, although it is too much expensive but I like intel.. try this item inly with KRAKEN 360 liquid cooler because it is a real monster:)))
this is perfect for an op build
Buy the AMD 3900X 12-core @ $419 or for the same price the MONSTER AMD 3950X 16-core for $709 still cheaper then this INTEL 10900k that is way to late for the party.
The AMD 3900x is half the price and offer a much better performance in multi tasking and only 5 or 8 less FPS in gaming.
This i have not benchmarked yet but it runs very well. Even under load highest was 41c.
