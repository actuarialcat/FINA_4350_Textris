Bought that CPU with the cooler. I’m having a blast. The cooler Installation can be a bit tricky but there is plenty ofvideos on YouTube that will explain properly how to install it based on your motherboard.Take it step by step and you will make it trough with no issue.Under load I get 69 Celsiusplaying HL Alyx.Love it !

This cpu DOES NOT HAVE HYPERTHREADING!
Bought the i7 as part of an upgrade I was doing to my system. The difference in speed from my old CPU was very noticeable. So far, very happy.
Just to let you know that this is not a processor that you can manually overclock. With that being said, it is able to boost itself during high demand and thegaming motherboard I purchased allows it to stay boosted to 4600 with a setting in it’s tools.
Hace 1 mes compre este procesador, lo instale pero no podía hacerlo funcionar incluso solicite una devolución pero al leer bien la descripción solo necesitaba actualizar el bios con mi respectivo modelo y marca de board y funciono por eso me arrepentí de la devolución.
Fast as f and hell of a good performance
Good product
This is a great processor, the only problem I have with it , is that it comes with a tiny cpu heat sink and fan and there is no pack of thermal paste for you to use on other cpu coolers . it is already on the heat sink . so you have to buy a pack of thermal paste if you are trying to upgrade the cpu cooler. Also the fins on the stock intel are thin. I paid 25-30 for the other one and it is thick in every way .
