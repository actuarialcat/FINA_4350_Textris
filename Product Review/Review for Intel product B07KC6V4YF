This CPU is a powerhouse, and still holds up well in 2020. It overclocks just fine, but I've never found a reason to keep those overclocks as stock settings chew through everything I can throw at it. I slapped a Noctua dual tower cooler on it and it stays relatively cool even under load. Just make sure you have a quality cooler and quality thermal paste. This beast can and will get hot if not treated right.If you wanna know specific numbers go watch a youtube video or read a toms hardware guide. As far as gaming, it made a massive performance difference when playing CPU intensive games like Arma 3, Escape from Tarkov, DayZ, and a few others. It crunches through video editing in programs that don't allow GPU acceleration.Also the packaging is super dope
