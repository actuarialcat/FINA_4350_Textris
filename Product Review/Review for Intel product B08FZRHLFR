Arrived ahead of schedule and excellent communication with seller but I wasted many hours of time only to discover that the seller-installed ram was defective.I blame the seller for not testing the unit prior to shipping.
The laptop works fine most of the time but certain games like World of Warcraft cause it to overheat.The fans turn on and they make a bit of noise as well as blow heat onto your lap.I suppose this is better than having the computer burn up...
The best computer I have ordered. Everything was great. 2 weeks and runs like a horse. Everything I ordered was un the computer. Received it 2 days early. No complaints.Recommend this to anyone starting out doing videos or pic editing. Premiere Pro Cloud runs great on it.
I received my computer 2 days ago. During setup the screen went black. I had to call Dells customer service to receive any help and now I have to send a BRAND NEW COMPUTER in to get fixed. My screen is either black or has pixels. The screen works fine, then will glitch and be pixeled.Update: Returning this computer and purchase same one. Hope this one doesn't have the same issues. I know things like this happen and was probably the >1% error Dell facility had.Update: I have recieved new my computer in a timely manner and it works perfectly. This company stepped up to the plate and fixed issue. Thank you. I use this for Inventer and CAD. It works great for these programs and even with complex assemblies.
