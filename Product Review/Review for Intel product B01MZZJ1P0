Great gaming
Returned product that doesn’t work. Hasn’t received any emails or response from them for over a month already send product back nothing.
literally dropped in place and restarted.
Ok
I've had this chip for 3 yrs. Its killed 4 motherboards. I finally figured out the problem was the CPU. Not a good buy at all.
Perfecta compra
you wont be able to also stream these games as it is gpu/cpu heavy at 95%
Good for my first PC
Works great from lighthouse to heavy gaming, but clock speeds that are advertised are not completely accurate.
I love it! I can play GTA V, Forza Horizon 4 and the newest game Need For Speed Heat with no issue! highly recommended for my gamers!
