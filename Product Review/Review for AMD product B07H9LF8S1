Ek has always had great products for the water cooling of computer components. This one is no different. There is also something in the styling that sets it apart from other brands. I have alway bought EK and always will. They have my loyalty!
Works exactly as intended and the build quality is fantastic, Another great EK product. Just make sure your ordering the correct version for the RGB. It comes in a 4 pin 12V RGB or a 4-1 (3) pin 5V D-RGB version.
