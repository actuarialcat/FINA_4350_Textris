You're not gonna get what you think you're gonna get.
It's obviously not a 10980XE
The item listed is one and item shipped to me were completely different CPU. The CPU that I received was 10920x which just has 12 cores. The Item listed is 10980xe which has 18 cores 48 PCIE lanes etc. When I demanded for replacement they tried to give me a refund. I was not satisfied with the response because if they had the version listed in the website. They would sent a replacement. So my recommendation is don't buy from this listing since they have messed up so many times.
PC confirmed it's 10980xe, 18 cores. Runs nicely so far.
Received a different product than displayed. Don't buy this.
Received 10920xCome on Amazon
Like others, received a 10920xâ€” different, lesser product.Scam.
CPU advertised as 10980xe, what arrived was 10920x.There were 3 in order.Returned immediately, card credited two weeks later.
Like all the other reviews say, the listing is for a 10980xe but you receive a 10920x instead.Still hasn't been fixed as of oct 8th. Do not waste your time.
The CPU itself is great, but Amazon will send you a 10920X, not a 10980XE. Don't waste your time.
