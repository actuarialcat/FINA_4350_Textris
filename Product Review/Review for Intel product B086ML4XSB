i loved this processor, and i love when more because amazon sent it himself, i really hate USPS, they always losing my products, i do play dota 2 with this processor, sometimes play WOW and PES2021, its very fast processor, it does not heat up like AMD'S processor's.
Excellent I recommend
First computer I've built in 7 years. Technology really has advanced quite a lot since the old days of Half Life and Gary's Mod.Back then I was rocking a 4670k, gtx 780, 8 gigs of ram, a corsair carbide 500r case, and a single 2tb hdd. But look at me now, Ma!I'm finally blazing down the PCIe highway after the wifey finally gave me the green light. Next upgrade will be the dinosaurs sitting beside the computer! (Keyboard and monitor)
This CPU is great , It eats everything I throw at it . I am so Happy ,This CPU plays every game I have or will have in the near future . Office is a breeze , I put my i7 6700 non k to bed when I got this .
Excellent CPU. Perfect for my Asus ROG Strix Z490-E. Highly Recommended!

This cpu is a MAJOR upgrade. Coming from my i7-7700k to this chip is mindblowing. The benchmarks are almost double, and in gaming there is a noticeable difference in frames. Super happy with this chip.
Hasta el momento no me ha dado problemas. Buen producto.
I was looking forward to build a gaming rig for the holiday only to get an used damaged chip. I noticed two vertical scratches on the item once received in the mail. At first I thought they’re on the plastic cover but nope...
Great CPU! No complaints, I won the silicon lottery this time.
