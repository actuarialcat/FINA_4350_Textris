This is still a great cpu.Have this in a low budget gaming rig I built for my husband. Combined with 16 Gb ram and the Radeon xfx 580. He mostly plays POE and WOW but he got 60fps on borderlands 3. This would great in any low budget build. You donâ€™t need to newest, most expensive cpu.

This is my very first time building a intel build and it worked perfectly. but i only bought this for updating my MSI B360 Gaming plus motherboard so i can get to 9th gen processors. but i have to say this 4 core processor really wiped out the AMD A10-5800K processor from my old computer so im am happy to have a good upgrade. will go to i7 9th gen once i get to it soon.
Used this CPU because it can run everything my mom needed it. Specifically chose this one because it comes with Intels graphics and I did not need to buy a separate graphics card. Works great
Good quality product, Thanks.
