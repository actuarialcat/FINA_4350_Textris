Good processor, aftermarket cooler is definitely needed if running games at high settings. Overclock not recommended as temps soar. 2666mhz ram max.
It arrives to Peru in 18 days. Fast enought taking a look to the other stores. As you see, the packaging was "meh". Not to mucho protected i tinky. But the product its ok and in the 100%.
It is very good for gaming, fast.Fast shipping, Great product.
What annoyed me was that the ad didn't really mention the box included a fan.It says "Thermal solution included in the box."Is that the heat transfer solution or a fan?Something to solve global warming?Ended up ordering a fan, having to return it once I opened this box.My motherboard won't power up, so either the brand new motherboard or this cpu is toast.
i have paired the i5 9400 with an asrock b360 board and an rx5500xt mech edition. i have no problems with keeping it cool. in 25 man raids i get 100+ fps and no lag. the heat sink will need to be upgraded to a cooler master or something similar. i would pair 16gb of ram with it. build price total cheaper than buying a pre built gaming rig.
works great for his pc build
Awsome value! Works perfect with my b365m mobo and radeon 5500xt!
