Easily the best CPU I've ever put in a gaming rig. It can be overclocked, and I can push mine up to 5.0Ghz. Even runs Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 seamlessly on Ultra graphics. I use three 1080p monitors and often have a dozen different programs running at once, sometimes multiple AAA games simultaneously. This thing delivers.Make sure you buy a good cooler. I can't stress this enough. I use a top-mounted radiator cooler, but a closed liquid loop will work too if you're up for it. Stay away from fans unless you have a monstrous amount of airflow with the intake/exhaust fans. This CPU gets really, really hot. It will do anything you ask of it, but be prepared for the thermal energy involved with all that computing.Also, ensure you have a good power supply unit. I had to upgrade mine from 750 to 1200 to be able to run my i9-9900k and my 2070 Super GPU. Before, it didn't even supply enough power to turn on my graphics card. Now, I can OC both without any issue.
This is the greatest processor on the market. Puts AMD products to shame.
even thought its a little older its still a beast
Upgraded my iMac (2019) 27” with this from an i5. Works perfect. Great upgrade along with new storage. Rips through everything. Very happy.
Using for my gaming pc. Everything runs very smoothly. Great stuff.
Great gaming cpu. Very fast
It won't be used for gaming but for other technical tasks that require this level of stability.
Easy to install and a great buy. We’ve had this for acouple months and no problems at all, runs great ! This was 10/10 a great buy
Never arrived from Amazon so I bought it somewhere else, not sure if it was Amazon or a porch thief but Amazon gave me back the money I spent on their website so I'm grateful. Great cpu for all types of tasks. With liquid cooling, never goes above 160 degrees fahrenheit
Amazing speed and stability.Very happy with it in my trading robot station.
