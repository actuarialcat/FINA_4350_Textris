The chip is performing well on everyday tasks on my Deskmini A300 running Ubuntu 20.04I bought the barebones a300w kit off newegg back in May for the sole purpose of building a cheap, quiet system for working (webdev), surfing and streaming.In the interest of silence, I added a Noctua low-profile cooler to replace the one packaged with the chip. I run 2x8GB DDR4 3200 SO-DIMM with it at XMP settings. Played with OC'ing the RAM and video crashed at around 3600, forcing me to hard reset the unit. No huge performance differences, besides instability over 3333.The system is more quiet than my Dell business laptop. I get mid 40C temps during everyday tasks. Mid 50c temps while "gaming" ... Mid 70s temps while ripping DVDs via USB (hottest I've gotten this chip).GNOME desktop animations are seamless. Animations of icons that have stuttered on my laptops are seamless on my 1440p monitor.When I say 'gaming' I am not on the newest AAA. I play Guild Wars 2 (2012) at low-med settings, at 1440p. It performs surprisingly well - ~50fps. I also play Everquest (Project1999) but honestly I can play that on any PC I own. I've tried to play Total War: Warhammer via Steam with horrible fps so far.
I put this in a 450 chipset motherboard and slightly overclocked it.What a fantastic little CPU!Put some good memory and strong motherboard behind it, and watch your office productivity fly.Excellent CPU, and I will be buying another.
Good purchase for what it is. I use it to play wow and lol. This stutters a lot when things gdt heated so I would recommend something else if you are going to play these games
Been using this in a 24/7 NAS for the past couple months running Windows 10 (2004). Using an L9a to cool temps in Node 202, stays below 37C on average. CPU utilization never exceeds 40%. The best bang for my buck CPU Iâ€™ve ever purchased.
my 79 year old gay grandpa became a gamer because of this processor
Great product at a good price, unfortunately we ended up using a faster CPU due to our needed performance.
Muy buen producto, rinde perfectamente para trabajos de oficina.
its fast yes u can play game 720 for 50bucks u cant beat it
I used this for a really lightweight VCenter Cluster, and it was compatible. Sweet!
Bueno
