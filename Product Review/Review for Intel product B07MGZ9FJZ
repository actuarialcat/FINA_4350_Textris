Works well, handles whatever I wish to run.
IF you game a lot you might need something more,but the speeds I'm getting and the no lag in switching apps is good enough for me!It and my 16gig video card handle games beautifully too!
Does good work works wonderful
It was really simple to install and my computer runs great. Didn't need to buy any of the 'lubricant'.
Great processor. Pretty fast
Itâ€™s a good cpu I would recommend getting the new 10th gen version though because it has 6 more threadsbut this is a good cpu I have it paired with my rtx 2060 and it gets above 100 FPS on max settings 1080p on most games
A lot of problem to received this product!
Does what it should
Amazing for single tasks but bad for multitasking
Nice and not expensive processor,you can play all games on this chip.
