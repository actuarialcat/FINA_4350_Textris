Brought this to replace my 9900K which needs to be RMA'd.It is perfect if all you wanna do is game as it is matching or a couple frames lower than a 9900K.The only downside is the price.I paid $320 for no graphics but I have a 2080 Ti for that.Would recommend if you don't need more threads or core for rendering, streaming etc.
finace built me a computer and used this in it. I dont know much about that stuff but I love my new computer it works great so i think its a good product
very good
This is a good midrange CPU. 6 cores, nice clock speed, and it should last a long time. This particular model has no onboard graphics, the one that does include it costs about $10 more, so take that into consideration. I went with a water cooler, to keep it from throttling, so far temps always stay low.
El procesador se daño a los 4 meses de uso no da video , calienta pero no da video mala experiencia comprando , no lo recomiendo.
Upgraded to this from a 2nd gen i5 and the difference is great. This is one of the best chips currently available. The only better chip is the i7s or i9s IF you need heavy multithreading like for video editing and streaming. Otherwise, this is the chip for you if you are a poweruser. No issues with installation or booting and a nice compromise on value between the most recent i3s and i7s.
This thing can take anything you can throw at it, and have never had any overheating issues.
Pedí el procesador con gráficos integrados i5 9600k ($194.99) y me enviaron el modelo KF sin gráficos. No tengo como devolverlo porque soy de Ecuador.
Great CPU, best bang for your buck from Intel. This CPU will bench higher than the i7-9700k with slight overclock. I run the CPU clocked close to 5GHz with stock CPU cooler without any heat issues.
so my luck is just average I guess. This one I got is only stable at 1.38v 5g 1.42v 5.11.49v 5.2.
