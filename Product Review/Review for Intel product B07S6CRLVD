Install was easy.. stock fan is quiet and cool well.
good cpu, temps are bit high in idle, in gaming its great.
Conforme
So first off the bat I just want to say that if you get this, get a different CPU cooler for it as well. The one that it comes with is terrible. I use a Noctua fan and it works great. For games it is an absolute beast and handles recording and rendering videos very well. Amazingly fast in both linux mint 20 and Windows 10. I upgraded from an old i7 3820 and this blows that out of the water.
good
I recently built a desktop pc for myself and chose this cpu as my processor, along with 5600 xt as my gpu. It work great so far with stable performance. I was thinking of switching to 9700k since it came out with the same price recently on Amazon but I was looking for something more stable and this cpu works just fine. Love it
worked as described. Came in solid packaging so there was no threat of damage.
No need for K series have mine oc to 4.5ghz
I7 gang, great speed!
Now that all of my PC parts are put together I am glad I got this part. It runs super smooth and quiet.
