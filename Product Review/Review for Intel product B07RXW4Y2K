Boosts to 4ghz without any overclocking and idles at around 30c. Overall performs very well for a 4 core
GOOD
Popped it into my board, and it works just fine! Much faster than my last processor!
I build many computers for retired clients, this is by far the best, solid/stable CPU for very budget pc builds. This CPU along with 2x8GB for 16GB of memory and 660P intel 500GB m.2 NVME SSD... is a 10 year office computer and basic home computer. 100 percent recommend this. No graphics card needed.
Using this as a Minecraft server, Plex server, file download system, media server and game emulation machine. It's works perfectly for all of these things while not consuming too much wattage.
Actually nothing to dislike as this is installed in a lower end gaming pc. I did however use a bigger CPU cooling fan than the one it came with, a Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black, Dual-Tower CPU Cooler
It came with 0 damage. Worked like a charm, will definitely order from these guys again.
Greta performance!
Amazon packaging and international,delivery are amazing. Thank you, Intelâ€™s 9th Gen purchase new product looks good. I'll use it well.
It came damaged
