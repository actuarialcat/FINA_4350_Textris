It doesn’t fit on my computer after PC partpicker told me it would it works but have to get new to upgrade
good product
Super easy to install. No issues with the cooler or performance. Solid CPU 6 cores 12 threads. It’s actually nuts for the price. Runs CS at 300 FPS (stretched) and can easily stream when paired with a solid gpu
Have not had even the slightest issue with this Processor during editing or gaming. A decent processor for mild to avid gaming and editing consumers. The fan surely can be upgraded later on to a better suited one but it does the trick starting off. Only problem I encountered was the B350 Motherboard and the fan were not fond of screwing onto each other easily. Other than that it’s a great processor and decent fan!
Didn't work
honestly, it's a great value! super powerful for the price!
On factory specs, it’s a good, cheaper alternative than Intel, but is somewhat significantly weaker in my opinion. I will overclock in the future and see how it performs.
Absolutely amazing
It took me a long time to review this cpu. It works great I had no problems with it :)
i put together a great gaming pc for bro unfortunately we went back to console but the build was a this cpu and 1050 non ti 16 ram and 800 watt power suply from evga so he could upgrade but he did say games looked great but now he doenst use it regreat doing the build.
