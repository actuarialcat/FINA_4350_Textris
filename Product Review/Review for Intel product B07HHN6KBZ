It’s a overall good starting CPU, it handles well at 100 percent load and at good temperatures. I would buy again very stable card.
Todo dentro de lo descrito
Work great - no issues
Excelente producto
There was a lot of 5 star reviews so the one time I didn't bother looking at them I get scammed. I'm pretty positive this isn't what the CPU is supposed to look like. Very disappointed, also it shouldn't have came in this kind of packaging.
Intel rules.
If you are saying you got scammed please say what seller you got it from there more then one not just Amazon now I feel like I got scammed because I don’t know if I got it from a good seller or not Amazon just today that this is posted stock up on this cpu since oct 11
It’s a very reliable piece
Buy it.
Great upgrade over my old i5-8400.
