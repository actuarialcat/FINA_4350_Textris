Overlocks like a turd. Very hot very quickly. Don't see a difference whwn it comes to gaming or everyday tasks compared to my ryzen 5 3600xt...which also does not overlook as much or as easy as I would like.
I bought this processor to play VR games, and since 3070 and 3080 graphics CARDS have been hard to come by, I paired it with an RX 5500XT graphics card. The speed and rendering is excellent, and I'll probably update the reviews when I get a better graphics card.
Luckily I got this when it was the same price as Micro Center for $329. I came back to get another one and as of 8/21/20 it is closer to $400 and would be worth it to grab a 3900x instead, going to a 3800x for $329 would feel like a smack to the face. I’m not sure why prices aren’t competitive with Micro Center on a more consistent basis. Bottom line on the cpu though is that it is excellent. Very future proof and if you look at year over year performance it is very similar to what you could expect on performance bump. Take Intel for example too, year over year on 10700k and 10900k we got more threads which is nice but speed was only a 100mhz bump. Whereas last years supply is still very relevant and a great buy. If you’re just gaming be ok with 3600, 3600x and 3600xt. If you’re a tiny bit scared to upgrade just to have 6 cores which benchmarks will show it hangs with 8+ cores, then the 3700x is just fine but if you’re creative and getting busy then 8 cores is great, but at this current price I would consider the 3900x at $400-429.
great cpu for gaming
