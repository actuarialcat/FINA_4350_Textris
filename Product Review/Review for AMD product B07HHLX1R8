Excellent I recommend
Best bang for buck great. Three of my PCs that I had built has this cpu
The major question I had no answer to when I ordered this cpu was whether I would be able to use my computer before I had the money to buy it the graphics card it deserves.I'm happy to say that I'm driving two 24" monitors (and might be able to drive a third, if I had it handy) using the onboard video of a Gigabyte B365M DS3H motherboard.I haven't found many times I've been able to saturate all six cores (and performance improved dramatically when I bumped my RAM to 48 and got rid of my swap partition). With a towering Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo cooler with 4 heat pipes it idles along at around 40Â°C. I haven't played with overclocking because "that's not a question I need the answer to". It does everything I need without making me wait.
I was able to overclock pretty well, but it is still an i5.I can get around 144 fps on Fortnite with this i5-9600k with the overclock on a z-390 A pro MSI board.I think this cpu is a great value, which is why I bought it.
Fast
This CPU is perfectly fine. I seem to have lost the silicon lottery because I can only overclock all cores to 3.7ghz, but since I got it as an Amazon factory return and saved about 30% I'd say that's worth it.My main issue with it is for the price I could have gotten a Ryzen with way more cores and better multi tasking. But too late to return this now so I guess I'll stick with Intel for a while longer. As a plus making a hackintosh is easier with intel than amd.
Yes better than the ryzen 3600x
Received an empty box. Box had non-standard labeling on the exterior and was empty upon arrival. This is a good processor, just have to find a company other than Micro Center to order from.
Facil de instalar, buen performance y sobre todo que es OC para correr juegos en alta calidad!
