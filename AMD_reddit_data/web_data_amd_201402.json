I went online to AMD.com and went and downloaded the drivers I thought I needed which was the Catalyst Mobility package for the Radeon HD 7870m (since I'm on a laptop). Well it extracted the driver like normal but when the install manager went to open it says that Catalyst Mobility can't be downloaded because the version of my graphics adapter is not supported. I found this really strange since the auto detect recommended the same thing. For shits and giggles i downloaded the desktop counterpart to see if the install manager would open. Sure enough it opened but under the custom installation option the list is only populated with the install manager and HDMI drivers (i know this is common and searching 'should' give me an answer but i have searched alot and nothing has helped). Well I didn't know exactly what to do since I now had no drivers and windows didn't recognize my GPU. I hopped onto the Samsung site (my laptop manufacturer) to grab the Samsung drivers. Longer story short it ended up on SW Update and so I installed it. Worked just fine and I had CCC and everything. I go to play Battlefield and after one round I got the red screen of death (oldish Battlefield/AMD problem that affected Windows 8 users just after the BF4 release) which I had fixed before back in November. Frustrated with the fact that that's back I want to update the drivers and get rid of it again, but my install manager still has a barely populated list (and i used the same removal method as before). Currently I have no drivers and I don't want to go back to the old Samsung ones.

All our saws are computer-automated, but two of the three require you to cut the boards.  They computer sets everything up--you just pull and go.  They are Celeron D CPUS, one being 3ghz and the other being 2.66.  They use DDR ram.  The other newer saw we have is a P4 with HT.  3ghz with DDR2.\nThey all use XP Pro, which of course, is being phased out in April by MS.  Our \"tech guy\" who really isn't that good, wants to replace all of the store computers first.  That's fine, except our hardware is starting to show age.  The HDDs are starting to slow down, and on the p4 board a capacitor has blown.\nSo I'm wondering what to do--buy some AMD apus?  I doubt our programs would take advantage of multiple cores, let alone anything else.  I was thinking of ordering some Phenom II X2s, but I found out too late that Newegg has quit selling them.  So that leaves APUs which would work good, but since it's coming out of our pockets, that would be quite expensive.  And I refuse to put i3s or i5s as they would be really really expensive.  $149.99 for the starting price on a CPU?  No thanks.\n\nAlso, is there a website or store that sells older stuff like Phenom IIs and earlier?  I was planning on ordering from geeks.com but they quit.  That leaves ebay, which I don't want to do, or Amazon.
