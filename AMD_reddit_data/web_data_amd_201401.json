I'm curious if anyone has noticed this type of behavior on an AMD GPU before. I initially believed it was throttling due to high temps, but blasting the fan at 80% speed keeps it cool and yet the behavior continues. I've followed all suggestions from varying forums to no avail (tried all recent CCC drivers with DDU, reinstalled Window 8.1, different fan profiles, etc).\n\nIt appears me card is throttling itself at a very low temperature. The only thing I'm wondering is if there is a way to edit the BIOS to control the throttling point.
