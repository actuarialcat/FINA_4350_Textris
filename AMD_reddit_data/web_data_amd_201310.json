I was having some issues with BF3, one of the suggestions was to uninstall the cap profiles and drivers and do a clean install of the drivers.  Well long story short, it turns out to be a bug in the BF3 patch, but in the process of uninstalling my drivers, I borked my system.\n\nI googled my issue and found lots of people with my problem, but my solution, as simple as it was, was never mentioned.\n\nSo what happens for some people when they use the Catalyst Install Manager to uninstall everything is the system sees a BSOD in the middle of the install.  After a restart, Windows then sees another BSOD at startup and the user is forced to go into safemode and use driver sweeper to remove the drivers.\n\nAfter this, however, installing the drivers again ends in a message saying there were \"warnings.\"  Then, trying to load up CCC gives messages like \"Can not load file or assembly MOM.implementation\" or \"CLI.implementation\".\n\nSo basically the solution is this:  Go back to your Catalyst Install Manager, and do a custom uninstall.  Select everything EXCEPT the drivers.  Once uninstall is complete, go to your hardware list, right click on your video card(s) and select uninstall driver.  Restart into safe mode, driver sweeper on the ATI drivers, then load back up into Windows.  After this, use CCleaner to remove junk entries from your registry, and use the uninstall list under \"tools\" in CCleaner to uninstall the Catalyst Install Manager.\n\nNow you can run your driver installer and it will install everything correctly.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "BSOD at Catalyst uninstall?

I didn't have much on my PC anyway, and it only takes like an hour to get BF back up and running again.\n\nI have run Unigine Valley and get an FPS of around 80 on the Extreme HD setting, which is roughly the same as the SLI 770s which are \u00a3150 more (worth keeping the 7990 then) I think, if I remember right.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI have just installed the Windows 8.1 preview to see if anything changes, as apparently its' the way to go for better performance, but have yet to test any games as I'm at work now and only finished downloading this morning.\n\nIn Windows 7, before I installed Windows 8.1, I noticed some strange things that lead me to question whether the card is running how it should:\n\n* GPU-Z shows the card has 2 GPUs, good, but I can only monitor the GPU Load on one of them.\n* GPU and VRM Temps exceed 80c, Vrm going to 84.6c at its' highest.  That just seems really hot.\n\nBut this bugged me the most:\n\n* After installing Windows 8.1 and the latest 13.11 beta drivers, I was prompted in CCC after the restart to enable Crossfire.  This...didn't happen in Windows 7.  This now makes me question whether or not the 2nd GPU is working, and the fact that I can't monitor the load of it on GPU-Z suggests I may be right?\n\nNow, Unigine shows you your GPU figures when running.  What core and memory hz, and the temps and FPS.\n\nMine only shows 1 GPU.  Should it only be showing 1?\n\nCCC is quite different to Nvidia's control panel, so I was wondering if someone could walk me through some of the basics of what should be selected for the 7990 to make sure its' working right, as I'm really confused.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nRegarding BF4 itself, I enabled the overlay graph to show the GPU and CPU graphs.\n\nRunning the 13.11 beta drivers.\n\nWith the 770s, I was running green and yellow almost overlapping.\n\nWith this beast 7990, the green graph is way above the yellow, suggesting there is no problems.  I'd only have problems if the green was BELOW the yellow.\n\nGPU-Z showed a 99% max load.  CPU around 70% load.  Good signs?\n\nBut I WAS still only seeing FPS figures, at 1080p, of minimum 30s, highs of 160, and average around 50.\n\nThe new DICE update that has caused everyone's PCs to see massive improvements has done nothing for mine.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAs I said I've yet to test any games in Windows 8, but I did do a Unigine Valley run as I was waiting for BF4 to download.\n\nSame FPS/result as I got in Windows 7.\n\nI may try the 13.10 drivers.\n\nI really, really, really hope I see a performance jump after switching to Windows 8.1 like everyone else is experiencing, otherwise I'm stumped.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "New To AMD - Are Both My GPUs Running?

So glad I didn't resort to reinstalling windows :)\n\n\nI was excited to install the AMD 13.10 beta 2 drivers on a Radeon 6950 Windows 7 setup so I could see what the difference would be for Battlefield 4. I was somewhat worried during the installation by a \"driver not signed\" warning, but continued on with the process believing that it was because the driver was still beta and not certified yet.\n\nUp until this point I have not had a single issue with my Windows 7 install, and have kept up-to-date with the AMD drivers.\n\nHowever, much to my chagrin, after I installed the beta drivers I have no way of turning on transparency for Aero.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that the windows desktop is no longer accelerated; significant tearing while scrolling browser windows occurs, and it seems like it's being rendered by the CPU instead of the GPU.\n\nBattlefield 4 plays fine though, windowed 3D games (Starmade for example) work just fine as well.\n\nI have tried multiple auto-fix helpers, checked my power settings (even though it's a desktop), tried uninstalling the beta and rolling back to the previous drivers, used system restore points (unfortunately don't have a restore point before the beta), driver cleaners, reg-fixes, Aero-forcers, system file verification...everything except for a windows OS reinstallation. I've clean-booted, made sure dwm.exe is running, restarted uxsms, and looked through every forum I can find to try to see what the hell could possibly be going on.\n\nThe Microsoft Fix-It utility (from the  Windows Support site) runs through the diagnosis and reports back that my video card does not support Aero, although when I run the Windows Experience Index benchmark it comes back with a Aero score of 7.8. The build-in Aero troubleshooter finds no problems with the card or drivers. This is so confusing!\n\nI have access to all Aero themes in Personalization, and everything other than transparency and acceleration are working when I switch between Basic and Aero modes. The checkmark for Transparency is not available when looking at the Window Color option. This is despite that all related services for Aero are enabled and running.\n\nIs there a file in windows which can be missed by all of these checks and fixes but which if corrupted or of the incorrect version will make windows Aero not work?\n\nHas anyone ever been able to fix this problem without reinstalling Windows?\n\nThanks in advance for whatever help you can give!\n\nEDIT: I should mention that during all of this I've reloaded the v13.9 drivers, but am still having the problem.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm asking for help...

But 290x is Better than Titan, which is a $1000 card.\n\nNow i was wondering, should i pick up 290x? you guys think the extra $300 i'll spend will be worth it? Let me know what you guys think.\nBTW current card i own is gtx 570. Thanks.\n\nPlanning on triple monitor, probably all 1920x1080, but game on one monitor. Wondering 3GB will be okay if i get the 280x.\n\nwill 280x be huge upgrade from gtx 570? just go for 290x?\nThanks again", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "R9 290x or R9 280x", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1p9ezi/r9_290x_or_r9_280x/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "chaykelly1", "author_created_utc": 1353865022, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9pft4", "created_utc": 1382890373, "domain": "self.Amd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1pbicc/290x_or_7990/", "gilded": 0, "id": "1pbicc", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/1pbicc/290x_or_7990/", "retrieved_on": 1411664544, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "What would be the better buy at this moment in time and for upgrading to crossfire in the near future.
