Essentially, I bought a PC from CyberpowerPC recently with the following specs:\n\nCAS: Cooler Master Elite 431 Mid-Tower Gaming Case w/ Side-Panel Window [-35]\n\nCD: 24X Double Layer Dual Format DVD+-R/+-RW + CD-R/RW Drive (BLACK COLOR)\n\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 4.00 GHz Eight-Core AM3+ CPU 8MB L2 Cache &amp; Turbo Core Technology [+80]\n\nCS_FAN: Maximum 120MM Case Cooling Fans for your selected case [+9]\n\nFAN: Asetek 510LC Liquid Cooling System 120MM Radiator &amp; Fan (Enhanced Cooling Performance + Extreme Silent at 20dBA) (Single Standard 120MM Fan)\n\nHDD: 2TB (2TBx1) SATA-III 6.0Gb/s 64MB Cache 7200RPM HDD [+31] (Single Drive)\n\nMEMORY: 8GB (4GBx2) DDR3/1600MHz Dual Channel Memory (Corsair or Major Brand)\n\nMOTHERBOARD: * [CrossFireX] ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0 AMD 970 Chipset CrossFireX Support DDR3 Socket AM3+ ATX w/ 7.1 Audio, GbLAN, 2 Gen2 PCIe X16, 2 PCIe X1 &amp; 2 PCI (Pro OC Certified) [+10]\n\nNETWORK: Onboard Gigabit LAN Network\n\nPOWERSUPPLY: * 700 Watts - Cooler Master i700 700W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Active PFC Power Supply [+29]\n\nSOUND: HIGH DEFINITION ON-BOARD 7.1 AUDIO\n\nWhen testing the new PC myself, I ran into issues where the CPU was underclocking/undervolting itself under load. To be clear, I don't mean that the issue is that it was doing this when idle; I understand that this behavior is normal. I mean I would run Prime95 and within about 5 minutes it would underclock itself to 1400MHz and remain at this clockspeed until I stopped Prime95.\n\nAfter numerous exchanges with their customer service department and bringing the PC in for an RMA, they replaced both the CPU and the CPU cooler; while it is not remaining at 1400MHz anymore, it is still periodically dropping to 1400MHz for a few seconds at a time while under full load, maybe every 2 minutes or so.\n\nI am being told by CyberpowerPC, after they checked with a senior tech, that this is normal for high end AMD CPUs like the FX-8350. Fortunately, I haven't played any games that make heavy enough use of the CPU to trigger this issue but I suspect I would see periodic drops in my framerate if I ever did.\n\nBasically, I need to know if they are right and this is normal behavior of the CPU or if they are full of it. If it is the latter, I intend to link them to this Reddit post and demand an explanation, so please be as detailed as possible if you think they are mistaken.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FX-8350 CPU Underclocks Itself Under Full Load", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1py2xi/fx8350_cpu_underclocks_itself_under_full_load/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "booobp", "author_created_utc": 1299869771, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4y81b", "created_utc": 1383858920, "domain": "self.Amd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1q4nc8/280x_and_never_settle/", "gilded": 0, "id": "1q4nc8", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/1q4nc8/280x_and_never_settle/", "retrieved_on": 1411621491, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit.\n\nBut I was wondering if I were to purchase the 280x now, is there a possibility of me being eligible for a future never settle bundle.
