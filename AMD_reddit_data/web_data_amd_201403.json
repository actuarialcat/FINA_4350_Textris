First off, my mouse pointer turned really big. I'm talking the size of a nickel. I sit on a 40\" TV screen but it is still way out of proportion. What's even more weird is that whenever I try to screenshot it, the image won't even display a mouse pointer at all. At first I thought it was one of the settings in the mouse options or the help centre that was acting up, but it is still set to the default setting.\n\nAnyway, now on to my real grief. The card started to run hot when I was doing simple desktop stuff like browsing, working or watching movies. I'd get [these artifacts (old screenshot)](http://i.imgur.com/wmogalr.jpg) on certain web pages but nowhere else. The temperature was hovering between 92-95\u00b0C and the fan worked at 40-44%. Did some googling and found out that the card was built to sustain these kind of temperatures. That's odd, I thought. I assumed I wouldn't get these artifacts if this was the case. But no biggie, they weren't overly annoying.\n\nBut then it started going downhill. When I tabbed out of games (old and new) it took ages to reach the desktop. The screen would turn black for about 8 seconds and the music and sound would stop during that time, even if it was set to play even when tabbed down. Even when I use the windows button+L to lock my computer, it locks up with everything visible for about 4 seconds then the screen turns black for another 3 seconds, before showing me the lock screen.\n\nSo I reinstalled the drivers (14.1) and it was all fine. Temperature was down to 40\u00b0C and fan speed was at 25%. But over the weeks it has slowly been creeping up again. [This is a picture on how it has looked like the past 6 hours](http://i.imgur.com/CG9KsbB.png). Should the load really be at 100% all the time? I'm not great when it comes to how GPU's work, but that sounds strange to me.\n\nLetting the machine rest for a few hours doesn't really help much. It takes less than an hour for temperatures to get back up to these levels.\n\nBy the way. The computer was freshly formatted when I first installed the card.\n\nPlease help me. What is going on?\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, as for the first screenshot. I tried to use the new card to mine crypto currencies.

I am hoping someone here can help me. I am currently running an ASUS asrock z68 pro mobo with a crossfired Radeon hd7950 and a cooler master 850w psu. \n\n Last week I installed my 2nd 7950 and set up crossfire. According to ccc everything is running correctly and my max temp with my primary card is 78c under load. I have never had problems while I am using the computer and all seems normal however last night was the 2nd time I got a bsod while I was away and the computer was in standby. I had one incident of freezing when I was backing out of a YouTube video but other than that have had no problems other than this bsod and what seem like random incidents of games freezing at odd times (once when I finished a mission in just cause 2). My video card drivers are all up to date. \n\n Once I installed my 2nd card and plugged all my peripherals back into the computer I noticed that my keyboard does not function until I get to the windows home screen but then works normally. It is currently plugged into a USB port on the mobo. \n\n After some internet searching I am wondering if it sounds like I need to update my mobo bios. I am a little hesitant to do this as I know it can completely inhibit the mobo and pretty much stop the computer dead in its tracks and I am a nurse not an it guy so i guess my question is does this sound like I am on the right track or is this likely not the case.

I downloaded the beta drivers (currently am trying the older 13.2 drivers) and let the benchmarks run. After some time the graphics card shut off (black screened), but the computer stayed on. Also, if i left my computer on for a long time with my screen off, when I tried to turn on the screen it would say that it was not receiving a signal (yes, i did never turn off the screen and never go to sleep).

I didn't think anything of it, kept on with the driver installation and such, but every time i needed to restart the same thing happened.  I tried resetting the cmos, disabling certain things in the power and usb settings. I swapped out drives and did fresh windows installs on them too and same thing happened. Did mem test and everything looks good there. I swapped out the graphics card with my old nvidia gtx460 (pny) and the restart issue disappeared. Plugged the new card back in and the issue comes back, so I think its the graphics card. I can shut down with no problem, and there appear to be no heating issues.
