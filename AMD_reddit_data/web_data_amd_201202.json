And just to increase the joy, of course pretty well all games are 32-bits, and my system is 64-bit, so layers upon layer of 32-bit libraries need to be installed, etc, etc.\n\nAnyhow, when the wind is in the right quarter (which it has been for a while now), Team Fortress 2 (a Half Life 2 Source engine based game from Valve) plays very sweetly ... except that every now and then it locks up.  At this point I can rejoice in running a new and shiny and fairly bleeding edge install, because (as of this year) I get to keep control of my system, I just have to wait 10 seconds to get the message\n\n    GPU lockup CP stall for more than 10000msec\n\nand I can wander over to a console and kill the offending program and try again.\n\nHowever, what is a complete drag here, is that there is next to nothing reported along with this message.  There's nothing to push upstream to the possible culprits who presumably are one of\n\n1. The writers of the Radeon driver, so they can make sure the card doesn't lock up ... but I can't thank them enough for making the lockup soft and recoverable, at last; or\n\n2. The writers of Wine.  Oh God, there are worms and wriggly things, and much murkyness there.\n\n3. Or maybe Valve themselves.  Maybe TF2 is at fault this time, I do hear people grumbling that TF2 keeps freezing.\n\nSo I have a question to the AMD graphics card community -- is there some way of getting some useful knowledge out of these stalls?  Perhaps a rolling log of graphics commands which could be dumped to file on a stall?  I could see that being incredibly helpful, maybe there's already an option to enable this.\n\nAm I in anywhere the right place to ask this kind of question?", "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Radeon GPU Lockup CP Stall on 6950 triggered by TF2", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/pl24a/radeon_gpu_lockup_cp_stall_on_6950_triggered_by/"}, {"author": "Kinematic9", "author_created_utc": 1250036940, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_3l1tw", "created_utc": 1329090031, "domain": "benchmark3d.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/pmnk1/amd_catalyst_123_rc_895_31_january_for_hd7xxx/", "id": "pmnk1", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/pmnk1/amd_catalyst_123_rc_895_31_january_for_hd7xxx/", "score": 6, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lZ_RA5pIT9EUyzGZ.jpg", "title": "AMD Catalyst 12.3 RC 8.95 31 January for HD7xxx  \u2013 BenchmarK3D", "url": "http://benchmark3d.com/amd-catalyst-12-3-rc-8-95-31-january-for-hd7000"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1329579150, "domain": "self.Amd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/pv9y4/installed_catalyst_121_and_now_hdmi_wont_work/", "id": "pv9y4", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/pv9y4/installed_catalyst_121_and_now_hdmi_wont_work/", "score": 1, "selftext": "I am using a 5870 mobile card and have been using HDMI out to my LG42LH40 HD @ 1080.\n\nNow that I've updated to 12.1 it won't even register as plugged in, any ideas?\n\nI'm thinking it's because the cord is 1.3 vs 1.4, would that have any impact?\n\nThank you in advance.", "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Installed Catalyst 12.1 and now HDMI won't work", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/pv9y4/installed_catalyst_121_and_now_hdmi_wont_work/"}, {"author": "antdude", "author_created_utc": 1282772991, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4a27h", "created_utc": 1329595664, "domain": "pcpro.co.uk", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/pvk78/amd_what_went_wrong/", "id": "pvk78", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/pvk78/amd_what_went_wrong/", "score": 4, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "AMD: What went wrong?", "url": "http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/372859/amd-what-went-wrong"}, {"author": "kaol", "author_created_utc": 1288556715, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4h9in", "created_utc": 1329926529, "domain": "news.techeye.net", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/q10we/piledriver_to_use_resonant_clock_mesh_technology/", "id": "q10we", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/q10we/piledriver_to_use_resonant_clock_mesh_technology/", "score": 10, "selftext": "", "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FEHYJPpVRyEkegBu.jpg", "title": "Piledriver to use resonant clock mesh technology, leading up to 10% power consumption reduction", "url": "http://news.techeye.net/chips/amd-creates-commercial-resonant-clock-mesh"}, {"author": "DrZeuss", "author_created_utc": 1293752353, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4o5yc", "created_utc": 1330202994, "domain": "self.Amd", "edited": 1, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/q5tuq/i_have_xfx_6950_hd_2_gb_is_this_normal/", "id": "q5tuq", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/q5tuq/i_have_xfx_6950_hd_2_gb_is_this_normal/", "score": 1, "selftext": "The fan on this GPU is always really loud.
