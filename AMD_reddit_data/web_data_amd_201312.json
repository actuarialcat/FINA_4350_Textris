I think the black bars appeared because the screen may have shifted for some reason.\n\n**What i have tried:**  Trying to get rid of the black bars I checked my resolution and it hasn't changed from 1920x1080. I went into the Catalyst Control Center and nothing seemed to change their either. The display is 1920x1080.\n\nRight now I have disabled the AMD driver, so i can actually view my desktop. \n\nI then went to image scaling and starting playing with it, and that seemed to make it much much worse. My screen stopped displaying anything at all and decided to show \"Invalid Format\" on it.\n\nI went to safe mode (only way i could see a display) and deleted the drivers, and reinstalled them. This did not fix the problem either. It just looks like a super zoomed in version of my desktop. I can't even see the start menu bar. \n\nI am clueless and would like your help. If you have experienced this problem before, or maybe have some suggestions please let me know. If there is another place to post this where i can get better help, please let me know. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have looked for solutions online, and none of them have seemed to work.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "AMD Troubleshooting.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1thd25/amd_troubleshooting/", "user_reports": []}, {"author": "frankhadwildyears", "author_created_utc": 1335218499, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_7jeum", "created_utc": 1387762658, "domain": "self.Amd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1thxcb/upgrading_from_a_1090t_is_fx9370_right_for_me/", "gilded": 0, "id": "1thxcb", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "mod_reports": [], "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/1thxcb/upgrading_from_a_1090t_is_fx9370_right_for_me/", "retrieved_on": 1411439897, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I've had my Phenom II X AMD 1090T 3.5ghz for at least a couple of years now and I'm doing a major rebuild of my machine.

It has a graphics switch that's supposed to switch between integrated to AMD graphics. The integrated graphics suck.\n\nI used it on Windows 7 for a while, and didn't have any problems until about this time last year, when I'd reinstalled windows, installed the latest drivers, and... weird things happen. I began to experience lag when playing League of Legends, videos started stuttering, and I couldn't change my Windows theme colors -- my explorer bar was perpetually stuck transparent blue. I was pretty sure this was AMD drivers. But whatever -- I made do with that.\n\nThen, I installed Windows 8.1. By default (IE, before drivers), my screen resolution seemed messed up (said 1920*1080, but everything was sized a little too large), LoL and some other things wouldn't start up at all, Netflix (Windows 8 App) wouldn't play, and I couldn't change brightness (super low by default).\n\nSo I installed the drivers, and things... changed. The resolution was mostly fixed, lol got to a further stage before crashing, and I could change the brightness, but not with the keyboard brightness control (only through windows 8), and Netflix was still broken, giving an error about protected video which I basically traced down to my driver.\n\nI installed the integrated graphics driver over it, and everything was technically fixed, but super slow because, you know, integrated graphics. It would be practically impossible to play LoL, and things would look shitty.\n\nI installed the AMD driver back, and the problems with it all came back.\n\nI tried installing an older version of the AMD driver (from back when it was working for me on Windows 7), and that caused me to bluescreen, and then bluescreen again on restart until Windows 8 said \"crap, guess you need to system restore to yesterday when you installed the damn OS.\" And then it did that, and now I'm back to the no-driver state.\n\nAnybody have any idea what I should do now?\n\nEDIT:\n\nOkay, I installed the same drivers again, and... They seem to be working. Uh... I'll let you know if that changes.\n\nEdit2: Crap, no, I restarted, and I'm having roughly the same problems again. I should also say, catalyst control center crashed as soon as I started it up.
