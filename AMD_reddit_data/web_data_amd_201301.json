However, every time I download and install those drivers, the installer tells me all of my software and drivers are up-to-date.  When I look at the driver status in device manager, my driver is listed as 9.10.0.0, with a driver date of 11/6/2012.\n\nIt's worth noting though that when I try to use AMD's driver updater, it can't detect my current driver (and neither can CanYouRunIt, it seems, although I don't know if that means much).  When I check Catalyst, it says my Driver Packaging version is 9.01-121106a-149430E-ATI, while my Catalyst version is 12.11.\n\nI don't know much about building computers, so there's a good chance I'm being an idiot.
