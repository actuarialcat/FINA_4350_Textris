I'm probably going to build a desktop computer in the next few months, I'll mostly choose what I buy by looking at benchmarks, and price / performance, but I'll keep all of this in mind. \n\nEDIT: Check out r/Nvidia's \"response\": https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/362p99/what_do_you_guys_think_about_this_ramd_thread_in/", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I sometimes read that AMD, as a company, has better values / is more respectable than Intel or Nvidia, does anyone know why ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/36264q/i_sometimes_read_that_amd_as_a_company_has_better/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1432480774, "domain": "self.Amd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/373j1z/want_to_test_your_graphics_card_with_the_latest/", "gilded": 0, "id": "373j1z", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 45, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Amd/comments/373j1z/want_to_test_your_graphics_card_with_the_latest/", "retrieved_on": 1443167425, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Want to test your graphics card with the latest games!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/373j1z/want_to_test_your_graphics_card_with_the_latest/"}, {"author": "JP20Boss", "author_created_utc": 1366343111, "author_flair_css_class": "amd", "author_flair_text": "AMD - Enabling refreshes.

It was a small card, a little larger than the pictures we've seen of the new Fiji, but it had the tiniest, fanless heatsink. It sat on top of the GPU chip and took up no more surface area than the chip itself. It was raised about an inch and a half high off the entire board. The rest of the board was covered in even tinier heatsinks. It had a dark green PCB; don't ask me why. I was just lying in my bed with the card in my hand. I sat there looking at it as long as I could just thinking that if I focused on it long enough, it might still be there when I woke up. After realizing it was a dream... I wished I hadn't. The dream ended promptly after and my headboard was bare of any silicon. Maybe if I tried harder... it might have been mine.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Amd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rw0n", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So, I literally dreamed about a graphics card last night...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/37l6pj/so_i_literally_dreamed_about_a_graphics_card_last/"}]
