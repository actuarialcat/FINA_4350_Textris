not a boxed processor
","

  I did not receive a boxed processor with fan and heat sink. I received a tiny box with OEM CPU only.  This product description was a lie:What's in the BoxIntel Core i5-2500 processor, fan/heat-sink cooling solution, warranty booklet, and Intel Inside logo label.

Buyers should be told that this is different than what is represented here
","

  This is represented as an Intel boxed processor which would have a 3 year Intel warranty and come with the matching CPU fan.  The processor I just received is an OEM system builder one which does not come in the Intel box with a fan so it will only carry a 90 day Intel warranty.  As a system builder I feel that this is very deceptive representation.  Plus I had to rush order a cpu fan to be able to start the build.

Good upgrade for my multitasking needs.
","

  I upgraded from an i3 2120. I do a lot of multitasking, simultaneously running spreadsheets, CAD, at least 2 different browsers with 20 tabs opened, listening to Spotify and playing Hearthstone all at the same time on a dual monitor setup.I noticed my spreadsheets were crashing a lot after asking it do complex conditional formatting calculations. After installing the i5 my spreadsheets don't crash anymore, my the system is running quicker but it's noticeably smoother than outright faster. I also noted that the SSD speeds are up to 260/200 now, whereas with the i3 I was getting around 160/100. I put this down to having 4 cores instead of 2. Yes overall I am quite happy with the purchase, I have no complaints, I think maybe I should have gone all out and bought an i7 CPU, but these are still 2-3 times more expensive than an i5. Installing was super easy, although I did have to upgrade my CPU fan to one that could cool temps of 95W up from 65W. The actual CPU was used but in very good condition, I've had no problems with it.

Using this for a 18+ months, still a strong competitor
","

  I put this CPU in a budget build with other mid-priced components, and it doesn't even feel like a budget build *at all.*It runs cool, it's fast and Intel processors have never given me an issue. I've only stopped using them to go from single core to dual, and then dual to quad. They've never actually died on me after years and years of being on 24/7/365.Get this or the current equivalent and spend the extra money you saved vs an 8-core or an i7 on an SSD - and your computer will go from 'I just clicked reboot' to 'holy crap it's up and running 100% already' in 10-12 seconds.

It's worth every penny
","

  I got this to replace the CPU in an HP p6-2011 desktop.  I didn't buy a video card, maxed out the RAM, and what a difference this makes.  My lady plays her online flash games on Facebook and boy do they hog a lot of resources.  Well this thing right here makes all of that a non-issue.  The graphics are beautiful, the desktop runs damn near as well as my other PC that has an i7-2600k.  I'm sure if I bought a dedicated graphics card for her the graphics and performance would only go up.Make sure to research whether you want the 2500 or the 2500k.  Currently, as of this post, the 2500k is more expensive so if you want to spend the extra ~$60, go for it, you won't be disappointed.Also, make sure to max out the RAM as that will make a difference and obtaining a decent video card will as well.  Unless you plan on going for an extreme PC build, i7 is the way to go.  For a reasonable video card, try the EVGA GeForce GT 630 2048MB GDDR3, DVI and HDMI Graphics Card 02G-P3-2639-KR.  It's a pretty cheap video card and accompanied by maxed RAM and this CPU, you'll have a great running PC that will last for at least 5 years without having to change out parts that can perform all your daily duties and gaming flawlessly.  You won't be disappointed.

Great budget processor for work, computations, gaming

  I was hesitant to buy an older generation, 32nm architecture processor. It was made for DD 30 DIMMs up to 1333 MHz, but I have been running mine at 1600MHz and it runs great. With 16GB ram it runs computational physics and chemstry programs smoothly alongside general media and networking. I am not using the oem fan, but my cores haven't ever exceeded 85C, and even after 120 hours of computation time when they are toasty I don't have performance issues.

  As someone who who stays well informed on tech I knew this was a great deal at around $100.  And drops right in my P67 mobo.Upgrading from an i3 2120 the difference is remarkable.

Great CPU, but pay $15 more for the i5-3550

  This is a fantastic CPU, and if you read any technical reviews, they all agree. Intel really is king right now, and this CPU is a great choice.That said, unless you are really penny-pinching, you should really look at the i5-3550, which when I bought it was only $15 more, and has an improved architecture (thus speeding up your processing): [...]Edit: Apparently, now the i5-3550 is even cheaper than the i5-2500, which makes no sense to me. I have no idea why you would buy this CPU over the 3550, especially since the 3550 is cheaper!

  This processor is good enough I'm still not thinking in buying anything in the short term; perhaps we are already at that point where processors are fast enough for anything. This model doesn't even have HT but i don't miss it, 4 physical cores work just fine, and it has that ""turbo"" mode where the processor gets slightly overclocked when using a single core. It's been rock solid, doesn't get too hot (around 50°C) with its stock fan. I'll be using it for many more years.I run Linux and this performs well doing anything: games, productivity, video, etc. Runs cool, saves power when not stressed.This model is not multiplier unlocked (you need model K for that), which means you can't do fancy overclocking on your own, but i never intend to. What for? this stuff is fast enough as it is and i rather have it last long.

Good Value and Performance
","

  This new ""Sandy Bridge"" processor is providing excellent performance for a $200.00 CPU (especially cost effective since the GPU is onboard--no graphics card is required).  It is installed in a computer with 8GB of RAM used for typical business applications running simultaneously and occasional audio/visual processing.  So far, no complaints.  Windows 7 (64 bit) boots quickly and CPU utilization overall remains low most of the time even under moderate multitasking load.  Some reviews mention the inadequacy of the heatsink/fan included, but mine hums along just fine at about 30 degrees (Celcius).  Be aware that there is a known defect in Intel's supporting chipsets (P67, H67) that will require certain motherboards to be replaced mid-2011 when the updated chipsets become available, so do your research before purchasing.  The defect is not in the CPU itself.A comment for those of you ordering from other suppliers using their free shipping options who are used to receiving the product(s) in the next day or so anyway...I ordered this CPU on 1/17/2011 using Amazon's free shipping option and it was delivered on 1/25/11.  (This is not a complaint--I understood the level of service--just a ""heads up"" to those of you who might presume faster delivery based on experiences with other vendors.)

  Before I owned this processor, I had an dual-core E8400 for mostly gaming but it began to bottleneck my system. That processor was an amazing one for its time but I quickly realized how slow it was compared to an i5 2500. I installed this puppy with no hassles and was quickly up and running. While not an i7, it's still very quick and it's all you'll need now for gaming or other processor heavy programs. Four cores is plenty for modern day programs, which was the reason I went with this quad-core instead of a six or eight core. Even when under heavy usage, this processor continues to remain at very low percent usage. Overall, this processor runs great and I've never had problems with it after owning it for a year now.  Intel's done an amazing job on this one, especially for the price point!Also note that if your not an overclocker, there's no need to go with the 2500K version. Save you money and go with the normal 2500.

  This is a fantastic CPU for its budget range.  The main decision is whether or not to bother with getting the unlocked 2500k variant.

  It's that epoch already...Yes...Bethesda is launching an ""Elder Scrolls"" game late this year... oh boy. About the only tech release that is able to make me rush into upgrading my pc.My previous mobo/proc was an athlon 5400 with msi nvidia 550 mobo and 2 gigs of ddr2 800. Up to this point, and coupled with my trusty GTX 260, that combination just worked. Fallout 3 and new vegas ran on that setup very well.But still, Skyrim is coming, and nothing irks me more than running an elder scrolls game with an underpowered pc, like i did back when oblivion was released. Not this time, not a chance!I got this for the upgrade:* This exact processor (I5 2500, not the 2500k variant which has unlocked multipliers and is more overclocker-friendly)* P67 mobo from ECS (With Rev B3, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET THIS VERSION OR FURTHER OF THE CHIPSET as it no longer has the SATA bug)* a Patriot 4gb 1600 cas9 memory module**** IN A NUTSHELL ****This I5 just flies, zips around like a Porsche. First time in almost 12 years that i get an Intel instead of an AMD, and I tell you, this one is worth every penny.**** PERFORMANCE ****I've tried a bunch of programs and games on it, some old some new, either in Win7 or Linux (ubuntu 11.04 ""natty narwhal""), and I'm yet to find any program that comes close to challenging it. Games, compression apps, you name it, this processor rocks...From my previous setup to this one, as an example, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" runs so much more smoothly, at 1920x1080, full antialiasing and details. I guess the proc/memory combo was a bottleneck in my previous setup.**** THERMAL ****At first, when I unpacked it, I noticed it comes with the run-off-the-mill heat sink and fan used with the LGA775s, the round aluminum one with the copper core. I was kinda nervous, as this being a quad core processor, I was afraid it couldn't possibly be enough for cooling it. I even thought of scraping the factory thermal wax that comes with it and applying a bit of silver-based thermal grease. As I didn't have any with me, and the prospect of keeping it on the box while i ordered some thermal grease online bugging me, I just plugged it with what came in the box.Wow, were my fears unfounded!It doesn't just run cool, it's downright gelid. If the gnome sensor applet i installed is to be believed, under a stress program I wrote no core went over 45 degs C... Are you kidding me? This thing is just amazing, the 32nm process does wonders to the thermal performance.All in all, if you're considering this CPU as an upgrade, don't ponder it any further, go and buy it, you won't be disappointed!

  If you're thinking of cheaping out on a new CPU --  don't.  But you also don't have to spend a whole lot to get something powerful, versatile and efficient either.  I'm not into the over clocking scene so I picked up the standard 2500 model and I have been nothing but impressed with the performance. Very few software apps are written to take advantage of more than 4 cores in the current environment, so you really don't gain a whole lot going to the 6 or 8 core competitors.  If you are really in budget territory, the i3 Sandy Bridge range is very competitive, but if you don't feel like forking out money for the 2600, this is a nice price point.  I don't think the factory cooler is very good - I opted for a Cooler Master - the processor rarely gets above 30-35c even under the highest gaming loads.  There isn't anything I can find even to nit-pick.  This is a good processor for a good price.Oh yeah, no Hyper-threading, but I've yet to encounter anything that would make me miss it.

The i7-2600K is not only a faster out of the box, it has more cache and is overclockable (the i5-2500 isn't).  Even though specs say the i5-2500 has 4 threads, it does not support hyperthreading.

VERY FAST.This processor is, in my opinion, THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK (with the exception of the ""K"" model if you plan to overclock).This processor is POWER EFFICIENT. My Linux server (which uses this processor) uses only about 46 watts at idle, and that includes 8GB of RAM, 1 Intel SSD, 1 Western Digital 500GB Black HD, 1 network card, and 5 cooling fans (including the one in the power supply and the CPU cooling fan).This processor is QUAD CORE (but no hyper-threading).This processor is LOCKED (signified by the absence of ""K""). For a little more money, you can get the unlocked processor, which is definitely the one to get if you will or *THINK* you might do overclocking in the future. It's only about $15 more, but could be even less than the locked processor if you find it on sale. Some electronic B&M retailers use the i5-2500K as a ""loss leader"", so look for that.You'll need an 1155 socket motherboard to use this processor with an H67, P67, or Z68 chipset.Not sure what else to say except Intel has a really great product here that really isn't too expensive. I fear for AMD and hope they can come up with something that can compete well.One downside is the chipset problem if you don't get the Z68... the H67 (for using the internal graphics) and P67 (for overclocking) have limits that can be aggravating depending on what you want to do. The Z68 has full overclocking support for the CPU, memory and integrated graphics.I purchased the ""K"" version of this processor (even though I am not overclocking at this point) with an Intel motherboard and Intel network card, to upgrade a Linux server, and so far it is working great.

  That is the best cpu i have ever own, low power consumption, runs very cool at max load 46 degrees Celsius (i think it could be 10 degrees less) when fans is max. I use my built in graphics card to play games and runs great. No lags no problems, (then again i have not max the game settings). I convert movies and play games at the same time still no problems. Movies convert in 25 mins or less. When the pc is idle.I love this cpu. I cant wait for the ivy bridge to come out and to upgrade. But honestly i would rather the i72600 100Mhz X4 faster.
