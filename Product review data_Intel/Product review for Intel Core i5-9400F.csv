  Awesome price point. Awesome power. I paired this with a gigabyte H310M A mother board, super easy install. Make sure you clean off all the garbage thermal paste that comes on the heatsink from the factory. Go buy your own arctic fox or Corsair paste. This CPU perfectly fit my budget build.Other parts if any one is interestedGigabyte H310M A motherboardNvidia GeForce GT 1030 graphics cardAdata SU800 256 SSDPut in a Thermaltake H18Some extra fans and a 450 BR power supplyThe H310M A motherboard does need a BIOS update to be compatible with this CPU.

Great 6 core  CPU for gaming!
","

  You save around $100 by going with this processor vs i5-9600k. This i5-9400F is locked and cannot be overclocked. It runs at 2.9ghz and throttles up to 4.0. So far I love it but the overclocking demon in me wishes I would have spent more. When in actuality this CPU rocks and does everything I throw at it with ease. I paired mine with a Gigabyte Z390 UD and some 3200 MHz DDR4 thus speeding up my memory bus! Added an XFX RX580 graphics card and gaming is beautiful! $100 saved will mostly pay for your memory or an SSD or even your liquid cooler that by the way doesn't have to be a double-wide radiator because this CPU is rated at only 65 watts it runs cool so I went with a single radiator and all runs very cool, so if on a budget this CPU is the way to go!

  Installed and works fine with no problems.  Value is better than anything local I could find.  Turbos up to 4 Ghz during gaming and works great.  I'm not an overclocker so my review doesn't cover that aspect.  Worked fine with my new motherboard and memory.  Wish all my builds had been this easy.

The bargain CPU of choice for those with graphics cards
","

  If you plan to run any sort of graphics card, vs integrated graphics, this CPU just might beat anything anywhere close to the price including AMD's similarly priced but generally more power hungry and lower performing CPUs. This is a basic lesson in thermodynamics. If you have the GPU on the same die it has to compete with the CPU for dumping tens of watts of heat. But if it's just a CPU with no GPU Intel is free to crank things up while keeping the total design power below a modest 65 watts which means quiet cooling and energy efficient computing. In summary 4th gen to 7th gen Intel CPUs were shockingly similar and not very exciting. It took Intel far too long but the 8th and 9th gen versions, with 6+ cores, seriously kick butt and this is a good example.

  Brought the i5-9400f processor was kinda a value price to me. Was easy to install but wish they gave us extra thermal paste instead of apply it on the heatsink. Great CPU no integrated graphics. So yes you gotta purchase a graphic card or not sure if some motherboard might have integrated graphic on them (I could be living in fantasy land). Advise make sure you do an extent of research before purchasing this CPU cause older motherboard won't support until you flash the bios to an update revision.

Great Value for Gaming

  Great performance of a current generation processor at a bargain. Yes, an i5 is a little slower than the i7, but unless you want to play the newest releases on Ultra graphics, you should be fine. The F series means there is no graphics processing capability for this processor, but as long as you have a graphics card (which you 100% should for gaming) then it works fine, but it almost $100 less than other versions of the i5 9 series. So happy I got this.

Good CPU for the price, even better at $150
","

  Bought this CPU when it was at $175, and it was a pretty good deal, but now its better at $150 as of writing this review.The CPU can handle pretty much everything I try to do, light to medium workloads, gaming gives makes heat up a bit but the stock cooler is great at keeping it under 60 degrees Celsius when gaming. Stock cooler is better than people make it out to be, might not be amazing when compared to other coolers on the market, but its more than enough for me and probably for many people, especially for this CPU that doesn't overclock.Bad thing is that you need a discrete GPU because this CPU does not have integrated graphics, I already knew that and was buying a GPU anyways.Haven't really had any problems with it in the two months I've had it.

  I spent ALOT of time confirming that this would work in my application. My PLAN was to buy a cheap CPU for a server I was rebuilding and eventually replace the CPU in a few years when faster CPUs were cheaper.While the 9400F was on the MB approved list the unit would not boot. I swapped MB and go the same result. I then swapped in a known good CPU which did work. I then  bought an i9 9900k which also worked. My MB supplier said the CPU must have been bad. I have my doubts since I have NEVER seen a bad CPU in my life. My guess is that my MB supplier had an error in their bios support list.Either way Amazon was good with the return. Just wish I did not have to spend another $400 for the i9 (although it is BLINDINGLY fast).

Stock Cooling Fan is more than enough - it works very well
","

  I am going to set the record straight on the stock cooling fan for this processor. I built a $650 gaming rig and installed this Intel i5 9400F. I was worried about using the stock case fan based on negative reviews on amazon. Let me testify that I'm running 4X120mm case fans with the stock fan, and the max core temp my CPU has reached is 68 degrees while playing Modern Warfare on max settings at 130 fps. The chip idles at 38-41 degrees when surfing the web. You can use this chip with the stock fan confidently. And it is also very quiet. People here reporting humming noise need to go more carefully through their rig and look for a different source.

Runs fast - stays cool
","

  Have had this processor installed about a week now and am very pleased with performance and cool running.For approx. $150.00 this is the best deal out there right now. I upgraded my motherboard , memory, and processor to an ASRock Z390, 3200 ddr4, and this proc replaces a i7 4790k (which was a great processor). To give an idea of differences, my I7 4790k was averaging 10,240 on Passmark. The I5 9400f averages 13,160. The I7 4790 when purchased a few years back was $320, this faster, more efficient processor was less than half that price.  I also added a WD BLACK SN750 500GB NVMe to my Motherboard.Coupled with my MSI RTX 2070 Armor OC I am averaging 15-20% more frames in games at 4k. Everything is much snappier using this cpu and even productivity runs much faster.If you are on the fence and are upgrading from an older motherboard to new hardware you won't be disappointed.

Extremely great gaming value
","

  This is probably the cheapest processor on the market that won't bottleneck your graphics card. I did some early testing with an RX 5700 to see if there was any sign of bottlenecks caused by the CPU. What I found is that I was getting the exact same performance as tech sites were with the RX 5700 where they were using the i9-9900k processors. Its possible that perhaps a RTX 2080 might be too much for it, but even that I doubt and if it were, the bottleneck would probably be minimal. I'm seeing 100% GPU bound in games like Gears 5/Gears 4 (where that rating is available). I now have my RX 5700 overclocked with custom power tables to 2024mhz. I still see 100% GPU bound ratings so the CPU is definitely strong enough for the RX 5700 XT as well. I did put a larger CPU cooler and 120mm fan. From what I can tell the CPU runs nearly 100% of the time (in game) at the boost speed, which is 3.9ghz for all cores. The temperature with the cooler I have on it does not exceed 52C, I know the boost clocks will slowdown if the CPU gets too hot, so that was my reason for installing the better cooler, although I'm not sure it was entirely necessary. For less than $150, I'm not sure there is anything that currently beats this CPU provided you are using a discrete graphics card. I nearly bought an i3-9100f with the plan to upgrade the CPU later, but after doing the research determine the i5-9400f would be a better value and last me much longer before the need to upgrade, especially since this was a gaming build. At present, I don't believe there was any reason for a more expensive processor for gaming. Obviously if you are building at the top end, you would probably be going with a higher end processor anyway. I was trying to get bang for my buck and I think the i5-9400f and RX 5700 build (esp since I got the RX 5700 for $280) accomplished that.

Great processor, 2 important bits of info, read below.
","

  Fantastic processor for the money, you can't beat the value and performance, it runs games like butter at 4.1ghz max. (CS:GO, Apex, WWZ, Battlefield V, etc etc)2 small caveats though, one of which I had to bump a star for ðŸ˜¥1. This is a processor only (No onboard or integrated graphics) so you will need a GPU. I did not bump a star for this, as they state it in the product description, but I'm reiterating here just for clarification.2. With this processor, RAM only runs at a Max of 2666, and only with the XMP enabled.  I bumped a star for this because this was not something they made very aware to consumers, and I bricked one of these motherboards flashing it, thinking I used the wrong flash file from gigabyte and that's why it wasn't reading my ram at 3000. Small gripe but having to disassemble the entire build and rebuild it (mATX is tedious because of the small case, atleast for me) due to that missing bit of information, that was very frustrating.Overall? Incredible processor for anyone on a budget, or building a secondary PC for gaming/streaming/whatever and don't want to spend a ton on it. I highly recommend it. I haven't tried streaming and gaming on this particular processor yet, but it runs so smoothly and with the recent optimizations to OBS, I'd dare to say this processor could handle that load.

Excellent budget gaming when on sale
","

  At a price point under $150, this chip is a good purchase. I would ignore the 2.9 GHz if you are using any decent cooling other than the included one. On decent cooling it will spend most of its time in 3.9 GHz range with all cores boosted. Only time I see low GHz is when chip is idle or very light load in background. Any active time it's 3.8 GHz-4.1 Ghz although 4.0 GHz and 4.1 GHz are rare as most workloads will use more than a couple cores. I would recommend this chip if you are Intel camp, need a cpu, can get it on sale, and don't want to wait on newer hardware. If you find it $129 and under it's a great deal. Anything over $150, go AMD r5 3600 unless you already have an Intel 300 series board.

Best CPU for $$
","

  Loving this processor so far. At first I was debating between this and the i5-9600k (same thing but has integrated graphics) and went with this. Very happy that I did, it's $100 less and if you have a good graphics card (which if you're building a PC, odds are you do) you don't need the integrated graphics anyways. This by far outperforms all of my other machines including my brand new 15"" MacBook Pro with the i7 and my iMac 5k (2017) that has a 4.2GHz i7 as well. I encoded Fantastic Beasts in handbrake at highest quality settings (H.265 HEVC, 7.1 surround AAC, etc.) and it took about an hour and 45 minutes WITHOUT GPU hardware acceleration. Amazing! For reference, the same job on my iMac or MBP would have taken at least an hour longer.I didn't mess with the stock CPU cooler / thermal paste. Picked up a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo and some Arctic MX thermal paste and it runs very cool. Under full load for extended periods of time, my temps do not go above 52C. No need to liquid cool IMO even though everyone seems to think you do.Here's my build:Thermaltake Core V21 mATX case (w/ included 200mm case fan as intake)ASRock B365M Phantom Gaming 4 moboIntel i5-9400f (this product review) w/ the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo CPU Cooler2 x 8gb Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz RAM2 x 256gb Crucial SSDs1 x 4tb Seagate Barracuda HDGIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1660ti (triple fan version)2 x Corsair ML140 Case Fans (exhaust)Overall I am super happy with this build and I'd recommend any of the above components especially this 9400f.

  I actually had to get one locally due to shipping issues, but this chip is great for gaming. Gets just a few frames less than the 9700k while only being around $150 or less. I happened to catch a deal on this at my local best buy for $130+ tax, so it's a great choice if you're gaming on a budget. For work I would go with the 2600, but if you're just gaming then you know Intel is the way to go. I ended up putting a different cooler on it than the stock one, so I can't say much about the stock cooler but I already know they aren't that great so why not just spend another $20~ on something better that will stay silent and keep your system running cool.Overall I would recommend this to gamers only really as there's no integrated graphics, so you'll need a GPU for any display. Also without the iGPU you lose some extra features when it comes to CPU assisted render programs.

  Processor at time of purchase was best bang for buck. If doing again I would really have to check prices of motherboards to compare as the 2600x is the same price, I would go that route I think for the multiple threads vs 6c6t. Intel needs to drop the price of this processor into the 130 range or lower imho to make it competitive again. Intel lacks the threads which does make a difference, they used to have the speed but that edge was lost as well. Overall itâ€™s a great processor doing anything I through at it, but you can get a 6c/12t with fan for same price

Paired it with an asrock steel legend board, 16 gb 3200 MHz corsair vengeance pro ram and a sapphire rx 5700. Getting excellent fps at high to max detail in 1440p gaming with this setup, very pleased. This cpu costs about 45$ more than the i3 9100, for the 2 extra cores it is worth it, more and more games need at least a 6 core chip to run at their best.

For non workstation use, I just don't see this processor ever being the performance bottleneck on your system, it seems to handle everything I can throw at it with ease.

  I upgraded an older AMD SoC Mini ITX CPU/motherboard to an MSI unit with this CPU, 32GB RAM, 500GB SSD, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080TI.  This thing screams for such a small, quiet system.  The CPU is leaps and bounds ahead of my old processor, and is able to perform video compression super fast.  The only downfall is that it isn't hyperthreaded, but the 6 cores are typically sufficient enough.  It's a great CPU if you're looking for best bang for your buck when bundled alongside a dedicated graphics card.

  9400F simply means that this CPU does not have built in graphics (this is why it is so cheap) which doesn't matter if you are going to buy a graphics card. This is the best card you can get for the price. It is the cheapest 9th gen i5 you can get. I'll leave you with this: if there were more reviews on this CPU, and people actually knew what it is capable of considering the price, you would not be able to buy the i5 9400F because they would be all sold out.

  I bought this processor as it was suggested for pacpartpicker.com's 'Modest Intel Gaming PC Build' guide. This was my first time building a PC and installing this intel CPU and stock fan was super easy. I love how the intel stock cooler has those ""buttons"" on the side where the screws should go, and instead all you do is line-up the fan on the CPU and push down the fan; no screws needed. It runs flawlessly with my new gaming PC!

  Arrived safely and in working condition. The processor was easy to install and runs great on my PC. I use it mostly for gaming, but also for Photoshop use. I decided not to use the Intel fan and installed it on my old motherboard/CPU to sell. Seems like an ok fan, but I have a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo and figured it would do a better job.For the money, if you have a GPU, this is the way to go. Is it a 9900K, no, but its also much much cheaper.
