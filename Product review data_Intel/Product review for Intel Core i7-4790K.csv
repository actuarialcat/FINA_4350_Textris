A superb CPU, but not a good value anymore...newer series are cheaper.
","

  For a little intro, I build customs on contract, buy everything up front and have tried just about everything.  This chip is in 7 clients' builds yet today, because every time they ask about upgrading I bring them over and let them sit down in front of the newest and prettiest, be it the venerable 6850K, 5930K, 5820K, 6700K, 6800K, 7700K and now the 8700K (I'm not a fan of the i9's or X's).  Nothing I have is noticeably better all around than this CPU, period.  You can take the specs and wipe with them for all the difference you'll actually see in real life applications.  It's no fun to say that because I WANT to see a difference.  I can clock this thing to 4.7 on water with such a small adjustment in voltage it's crazy, and rise only 5-7 degrees C with a custom loop to idle at 38-40 degrees and run hot right around 50 (a little of it is due to my loops and 20+ years of building), but no other CPU I've used  reacts like that.  I own games.  I've never finished 95%  of them because to this day almost nothing taxes the CPU.  So I test with video editing.  4 cores and 8 threads is enough for any normal human, if you're a pro then you'll want something for an X99 or 2011/2066 board.The only cons are that this is going up in price and Z97 boards are harder to find new.  When I read that the 6700K, 7700K and 8700K are upgrades I just grin.  And why the 6 and 7 series were produced at all is nothing but marketing and little tweaks that aren't noticeable.  I have a Threadripper as well as all the above and more, and when you want to be stunned then see what all those cores are good at and compare THAT to Intel's consumer chips.  AMD's version of the Xeon is NOT great all around but the Intel folks aren't any smarter than the AMD developers, they only have deeper pockets to draw from and a longer history of doing the same thing the same way.  That's why the 4790K stands out...but until the 8700K I think Intel was just punching the clock.  It's a superb CPU that's NOT going down in price AT ALL because it's still so viable that the software has yet to catch up.  If it's used with the right board, with the right RAM and BIOS set the right way I'd still put it up against the 8700K built by 95% of the market that's buying them and getting their comparisons on their cell phones and shouting specs from the rooftops :-)  Next time just ask them how many Ghz to fill a gallon halfway?!!  It get's pretty peaceful. :p

Breathes New Life Into An Older PC
","

  I have a mobo that is several years old: ASUS Maximus VI Hero. It's a Z87 chipset Republic of Gamers (ROG) platform. I had previously upgraded to the highest 1150 Intel i5 CPU, the i5-4670K. With a 1603 BIOS update, the mobo became eligible for the i7 CPU line without changing any hardware. So I opted to upgrade to the i7-4790K CPU.(Note: If you're replacing a CPU, make sure you clean the CPU contact side of your existing CPU cooler. Wipe away the thermal paste with a lint-free cloth, followed by a thorough scrub with alcohol. When completely dry, apply new thermal paste to the top of the CPU using the DOT technique -- look it up if you don't know what it is.)I chose this path mainly due to the many 5-Star customer reviews of this product and, since I'm getting along in years, I didn't want to replace my mobo and CPU.Folks, the i7-4790K is the real deal. It lives up to the years of hype and positive comments. Sure, the technology is a few years old, but from what I've read about newer CPUs from both AMD and Intel, I believe it when other PC enthusiasts claim the i7-4790K can hold its own against them.I won't get into the technical babble about this CPU, because I don't care. It is simply on fire (figuratively speaking), outperforming the previous CPU by leaps and bounds. If you purchase the i7-4790K, make sure you have an excellent CPU heatsink (I have never used a stock one for obvious reasons).I also installed a new EVGA RTX 2060 Super video card in the same upgrade.I mostly play Skyrim Special Edition with many heavy texture mods. Believe me when I say this game has never looked so great with my new upgrade. I'm entirely happy with my purchase. This might be the last PC upgrade for me.I know there will be naysayers with negative opinions about my upgrade. Please keep them to yourself and worry about your own rig.My rig:Antec Twelve Hundred Full Tower Case (3 intake fans & 4 exhaust fans)Corsair 1,000 Watt Modular Power SupplyG.Skill 32 GB PC-1600 Memory (set to 1600 in BIOS with 9-9-9-24 timings)Thermaltake Dual Fan CPU Cooler (this is a beast; can't use Ripjaws or other tall memory sticks)ASUS Maximus VI Hero MotherboardIntel i7-4790K 4.0 GHz CPU (mobo auto OC to 4.4GHz)EVGA RTX 2060 Super XC Ultra 8 GB GDDR6 Video Card (factory OC)I'm a happy camper!

Excellent Haswell-Based i7 Processor
","

  This is a fantastic processor with great ability for over clocking, if you wish to do that. Having said that, it is so powerful that all but the most ardent gamers may never see a need to over clock. This thing purrs like a kitten, and because it is Haswell based, has very good onboard graphics support, and runs much, much cooler than earlier processors due to its 22 micron manufacturing process. Although it isn't exactly cheap, it is in relationship to earlier processors which were much, much more expensive with only a fraction of the power, and churning out so much heat you needed six fans in a case to keep it running. This one barely notches up by Noctua cooling fan hardly ever because its so cool running.And speaking of fans, even though I have the Noctua fan for its near silent operation, I was surprised that the supplied cooling fan that comes with this processor is surprisingly quiet. In fact, if you are not too picky, you might not need to replace the stock fan at all due to its quietness. (Be careful not to touch the boom of the fan mount, as it comes pre-pasted with thermal paste; you don't want to get you fingers on it before you mount in on the CPU).So, I can easily recommend this terrific processor for its performance, price, and cool operation. It's a five star device in my book.Note:I have mine mounted in a:1.

  Best option if you have an 1150 Z97 board and need to make your system last a little longer.  Sure you could go with some of the newer processors, but you would need a new board and RAM and that means spending $600+ to get about the same performance this one can give you.

awesome chip! osx
","

  This is my review of the 4790k after 3 days of owning it. During the course of these 3 days, I have not had a boat load of time to play with it. But I did get a chance to OC it. And I definitely have felt its power. So, a lot has yet to be learned about this CPU, but for what its worth, heres my review.Notes:For this record, this is a osx build. Not gonna list all the specs. El Capitan. See the OC section of this review to learn more about OCing hackintosh with this chip.Performance OOB:My computing tasks are 85% raw image editing (photography),12% web browsing, and 3 % video editing anymore. But I needed a CPU that could crush raw HDR photography blending in Lightroom 6. Just for comparison, this 4790k is probably 4 times faster at creating raw HDR files from 5-7 exposures than my previously owned i5 4430 3.0Ghz. It exports edited images more than twice as fast... This thing is definitely fast. Truly, the fastest you are going to get for gaming, everyday computing, basic photo editing, etc. You can't get a faster chip. I know, I know, the 6700k is out. But its hardly any better than this chip. DDR4 does absolutely nothing for performance at this early stage... Most people will tell you to stick with the 4790k. The only chip i really contemplated having over this one is the x99 6-core 5820k.My Cooling:Using a Hyper212 Evo. Stock fan... 4 case fans (2 corsair SP120s, 2 NZXT 120mm). Stock CPU temps with my build are about 32-34C. I was going to go water cooling for this but when you TRULY research it, AIO water coolers are practically a joke when it comes to reliability. But I might make the jump to H2O just to reach better OC freq.Overclock:Ok, so I never overclocked before. I knew I wanted to OC this chip. This was my first chance... So, I decided to read up on it to prevent any idiotic impulse decisions... Little did I know there is basically no ""beginner"" info for getting into overclocking that is relatively simple to understand. In short: I went to the BIOS and set Vcore at 1.25V, Ram at 1333mhz (1866mhz rated), multiplier at 45x ... Monitored temps with Intel Power Gadget and stress tested with Prime95 (mac). Nothing too in-depth.OC Results:So, i think I have a decent chip for OC. Either that, or im doing something wrong that I dont know of haha. Hyper212 Evo - stock fan.4.6GHz @ 1.265V ~83C Max (P95 for 5 minutes) PASS4.6GHz @ 1.250V ~82C MAX (P95 for 5 minutes) FAIL4.6GHz @ 1.260V ~83C MAX (P95 for 10 minutes) PASSThe last OC, I sit ""stable"" at. For now. I know its only 10 minutes and 5+ hour tests are ""the accepted standard"" but P95 at 10 minutes stresses my CPU harder than I will ever use it. Heck, its so fast that even exporting a heavily edited 5 minute movie project will take less than that.. Im certain its stable. But will be testing more at this OC.Conclusion:I'll update this as needed. A few points... buy it. Its good. Its all you need. Crush the stock heatsink with a hydraulic press if you plan on stepping outside 4.0ghz base clock. If you're heavily gaming (i dont game), get a good cooler like the Cryorig H7 (i want that)  or the Noctua big coolers. Hyper 212 is decent. Cryorig H7 is a better product... But anyway, if you're gaming, you wanna keep your CPU cooler as much as possible, not only for performance, but simply to keep the wear and tear down on it.------------- UPDATE 6/19/16 -----------------------So i've owned this chip for about 2 weeks now. Since then, I have decided to upgrade my cooling solution. I went with an h100i GTX. Stock thermal paste. Just slapped it on there (cleaned the old paste off first). Using stock fans and added 2 more nzxt case fans on the other side of the rad to keep it cooler.Temps with the h100i are better. Not as good as I expected, but they are good. I can now keep temps stable clear up to probably 4.8GHz. I only stress test with p95 for a few minutes. Anything past that is just unecessary. I don't push my CPU as hard as p95 ever, so theres no sense it wasting time (im sorry if you disagree).Now, I was able to OC to 4.6 GHZ with no issues on temps. About ~80C with my h100i and everything running. and 1.247VI am trying to get to 4.7 but this chip is causing me to crank the voltage at 4.7 to nearly 1.30V which i dont like because my Vcore spikes during P95 past the Vcore set value.Im not a great overclocker, so im curious to see if someone else could do better on this chip. But honestly, I think my chip is decent for OC, but its definitely not a golden chip like some seem to get.

  This CPU is insane. The 8 threads definitely makes a difference in multitasking, (There's plenty of YouTube videos on that). I put this in my gaming rig and it runs games even GTA V on very high settings with my GTX 760. I am NOT an Intel fanboy, my previous CPU to this was an AMD but I gotta say Intel took the cake in this build. But I will say, you don't need this for gaming, the Intel Pentium anniversary edition (a dual core non hyper threaded chip) runs games very similar to this CPU. Games usually don't utilize 4 core and certainly not 8 threads. If you want a CPU that's quad core and this is out of your budget check out the i5 4690k it runs games and the EXACT fps as this one (again YouTube videos on that as well)To summarize this is a very strong very fast chip. Great for gaming and multitasking. Pretty decent on video editing because of the hyperthreading.

Best chip for LGA1150 socket
","

  I got this to upgrade from my i5 4690.  I did not want to spend the money to upgrade my motherboard (and then RAM), and this is the highest tier CPU for the LGA 1150 chipset.  The product arrived factory sealed.  It's as easy to install as any Intel CPU.  Even though it is marketed as running at 4.0, it defaults to 4.2 without manual overclocking.  Whether or not that was a default choice by my motherboard to kick it up or not, I can't say.I'm still running the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (air cooling), and the chip hasn't gone over 60 during any of my normal use - gaming and VR.  It touches 62-64 at times during stress testing, which is still well below anything that would be worrisome.  So you can get some mild overclocking on the chip without converting to liquid cooling.

  (The CPU has been in use for nearly half of a year as of this review)I purchased the 4790K for a PC build I was doing for myself. I have build several ""gaming"" computers at this point so I have a bit of experience. The product arrived fully functional and was installed into an MSI Z97 SLI Krait Edition motherboard.This processor never misses a beat. I use the computer for primarily gaming but also for CAD and related engineering uses. For these purposes the CPU stays cool and under-utilized on the stock CPU cooler. I have some benchmarks bellow.Cinebench R15852 Multi-Core173 Single-CoreOverall, I am very happy with this CPU and will be soon overclocking it. If you are just gaming or enthusiast video editing or something along those lines, this CPU is more than enough.

A nice upgrade from my old i5. Great for streaming!
","

  I've been rocking an old i5 4670k for the past several years. It has served me well for most of that time, but only having 4 cores finally caught up to me when trying to stream games like Sea of Thieves. The CPU could handle the game well enough on its own, but trying to run SoT, OBS, Discord, and FaceRig all at once? Nope, the poor thing was maxed out at 100% utilization and both my game and stream were dropping frames left and right even when using NVENC on my GPU to encode the stream video.So I bought this i7, overclocked it to 4.5GHz like my old CPU, and next time I streamed I had no trouble at all keeping 60FPS even during intense ship battles and large skeleton fights. Though the 4790k still only has 4 physical cores like the i5, the 8 virtual cores provided via hyperthreading made all the difference for juggling the intense workload incurred by streaming and keeping everything running smoothly. I highly recommend this chip if you're looking to breathe some new life into an aging system.

Cool, quiet, powerful processor
","

  I have owned this particular processor since November 2015. It has been paired with an Nvidia GTX 970 since that time, though I am upgrading it to a GTX 980ti soon.As for the processor, I paired it with a liquid cooling pump and it stays extremely cool at idle and even under load. When idle, it chills at around 28-30 celcius, and even under load in a game I rarely see it go above 63 degrees celcius using RealTemp.The processor is very quiet with the liquid cooler and the graphic card gets louder before this. But since I game with headphones on, I don't really notice.As for the performance of this processor, it is a beast. I didn't run benchmarks on it, but in actual gameplay like World of Warcraft, Rome II Total War, Total War Atilla, GTA V, Witcher III and many more I never experience anything I would attribute to a slow CPU and I am running, at the same time, a VirtualBox server in the background and hosting a Plex Media Server (though admittedly I'm not usually WATCHING anything from my plex media server while gaming, so it's not trying to encode video and play a game) and this thing never slows down.For those debating between the i5-4590k and the i7-4790k, I chose the 4790 because I planned on eventually doing video editing and read that extra power was needed from hyperthreading. I also chose it because, in my mind, 8 cores (4 actual, 4 hyperthreaded) are better than 4 without hyperthreading. In my mind, I felt I was better future-proofing my computer than if I had just gone with the 4590k. I'm sure people could say ""but more than 4 cores isn't needed in games"" and I would agree, but we don't know what the future will hold in terms of games that CAN make use of more than 4 cores, and I also like having the overhead to know that even if I'm playing a game I can be running whatever the heck I want in the background and this thing keep on plugging.I did not do much overclocking. I just did the auto overclock that comes in the BIOS of my board. It seems fast enough on its own and I didn't want to mess with much stuff.As for this processor against newer Skylake processors, I read reviews and benchmarks where this processor was very close to the newer processors with similar amounts of cores, and I don't need the newer features present on the new chipset and newer boards. So I'll probably skip Skylake and consider the generation AFTER Skylake if the performance gains are significant or I need the newer features present on that future generation chipset. So I'm expecting to keep this CPU around for AT LEAST another year, probably 2 or more.

Fastest i7 for LGA1150 yet
","

  Very fast CPU, I haven't tried any overclocking yet.  Using the stock frequency and with the ""most heat"" setting of Prime95 stress tester my liquid cooling system is not able to keep up and it overheats.  Using the ""balanced"" setting of Prime95 it does fine.  This may not bode very well for overclocking, I may need to upgrade my cooling system.  I'm using a Corsair H60 120mm liquid cooler with Tuniq TX-4 ultra high performance thermal compound.  My previous CPU, an i5 4670K, did not come near overheating under the same conditions.  Since this i7 uses hyper threading on 4 cores for a total of 8 threads, along with the higher frequency, increases it's workload greatly.  I'm also not sure how well Prime95 really simulates actual conditions.  Nothing else I've thrown at it in normal usage causes an overheat.  More testing ahead.  The Amazon ""Prime only special"" price on this was nice too.Update:I updated to a 240mm water cooler and this CPU is now running much cooler even with some mild overclocking but it still cannot handle Prime95's ""most heat"" setting.  It immediately overheats.  I think that test may not reflect real world conditions.  Nothing else, even with some overclocking, comes near to overheating the CPU.  I don't know if the Prime95 application was written with this type of processor in mind.  So I will continue to test with a bit more overclocking and see what happens.  I won't test any further with that 'most heat' setting of Prime95. Otherwise this CPU has been working great, no problems at all.  With this CPU and an SSD boot drive Windows 10 boots almost instantly.Update:It was suggested that I try an older version of Prime95 to test (see comments) and it does work as it should with the older 26.6 version.  It runs at 68-70 C using the same settings that caused it to overheat with the later version.  Some internet research verifies this to be an issue between at least some of the latest Intel CPUs and the later Prime95 versions.  I had suspected it to be an issue with Prime 95 and apparently it is.  So if you are going to use Prime95 to test this CPU, I at least, recommend you use the earlier version of Prime95 to avoid prematurely making toast out of your CPU.

  Bought it in October 2014 (4 months after launch) and it has been the best processor I have ever had. I am nowhere near thinking of upgrading and it runs better than some newer generation i7. Overclocks with no issue. Now, I only paid $309 in 2014 so I am not sure it would be worth buying this generation at this price in 2018, but if you have to because of compatibility, this is the best z97 processor you are looking for.

Great upgrade

  I started with an i5 cpu 4 core, and this is a visible and noticeable upgrade from that! I can now run nearly all my games at far better qualities than just minimums since upgrading to this and have far better framerates overall. You'll still need to upgrade any Graphics cards if yours is out of date, but for gaming, home, and streaming uses (like netflix or YouTube or even VR), this card works great!Pricey, for sure. And definitely not something for budget setups. But it definitely helps and has a visible difference. Personally, I'd say it's a good deal if it goes under $260, and to not pay anything over $360, but otherwise, it's a great CPU that's a definitive upgrade for any system!

  What overheating issue...... I've read a lot of reviews about overheating issues with this chip, I've experienced none of them. Now, I would NOT recommend using the heat sink that is supplied with the cpu. Maybe that's the issue many people were having.I have a pretty basic setup that I use for work and education. I'm have an IN-WIN slim formfactor m-ATX chassis, Asus mobo, and a Samsung SSD. I replaced the exhaust fan that came with the chassis for an 80mm Noctua and I'm using the Noctua NH-L9x65, 65mm Premium Low-Profile CPU Cooler. CPU hasn't gone above 89 degrees.I have two of these boxes, one for my VMware lab and the other for my Cisco network lab. Not one issue.

Excellent CPU even in 2017
","

  Even in early 2017 I was still happy with my purchase of a new Haswell generation i7-4790K. In most metrics it is equal to or outperforms its successor the i7-6700K. The 7700K may now have the edge but like the 6700K is lga1151 and would require updating my current motherboard and ram which is much more expense for little perceived benefit. I decided to purchase this new directly from Amazon because many, used on ebay, regularly go for $250+. Without knowing what the previous owner did to the cpu I'd rather pay $50 more for the assurance that I have a new product with Amazon's excellent customer service behind it. I overclocked only a little but have more satisfactory temperatures at stock configuration of 4ghz base, 4.4ghz turbo which is plenty of power. If you are building an all new system go for the i7-7700k as it will be supported on newer motherboards with newer options like USB-C etc. If you already have a lga1150 motherboard and want to move up from an i3 or I5 this will be cheaper than adopting a whole new motherboard platform and you won't be disappointed.

  This worked perfectly for 4 years. I'm about to upgrade to a 9000-series Intel CPU as I write this. The newer CPUs are only maybe 15% faster for 1-4 thread workloads, which makes this CPU all the more impressive.The only drawback I can think of is that Intel's overclocking software (on Windows) seems to cause instability, although regular overclocking through BIOS seemed OK.Definitely better than AMD, which is 95% marketing hype and 5% product.

  System was purchased almost entirely on Amazon. My previous i7-860 build was done the same way. Amazon is a great way to make a computer. I really like the Amazon site tips where they tell you what other parts people are buying along with your processor or motherboard etc.. Very helpful and dead on. I picked away at buying parts for this over the last 6-7 months almost like a layaway program. I popped in the win 10 disc and voila I was up and running in literally minutes, scary fast. Negative Windows 10 reviews on the site are all from non-verified free upgrades from non-purchases. Don't read them!! Worthless. Buy the disc and get a real operating system.01. i7-4790k LGA115002.

On the day I loaded win10, I gave it the first big test with the mobo Intel Graphics. I dialed up Steam and put Tomb Raider on the HDTV to see how the new processor and Gigabyte motherboard ran without a real GPU. WOW, was I shocked. TR ran on normal level where my i7-860 runs TR. i7-860 system won't run TR on ultimate settings at all. Once I got the Gigabyte GTX960, TR ran on ultimate without even breaking a sweat.The entire system ran me about $1500 and the only other software I purchased was Adobe Lightroom and Nero 2015. If you match the pieces of this system you will have a nice ready to run anything PC. Windows 10 so far is impressive, but was very upset to lose my favorite MCE from win7 that ran everything perfectly. Gotta start reinventing the HDTV portion.UPDATE:2016-01-15, The Amazon purchased computer parts above have proved to be ROCK SOLID one year later. I did recently buy the new Tomb Raider, Rise of, which has the ability to run on DirectX 12 or not. Also the game is one of the first to utilize all cores of the i7-4790k processor. I haven't verified this other than what I heard once. The game runs Rise of TR on ULTIMATE settings, but I think the DirectX 12 needs some work. I can't say enough about this processor and computer build. With so many other computer builds or rebuilds, there is tweaking and hunting for patches or fixes(win98,winXP,Vista,win7), and this win10 i7-4790k, it is simply awesome. You turn it on, and you are ready to be computing or dialing up Steam in seconds! My win7, you can go refill your coffee and anything that coffee induces during start up. The $300+ for the processor was a great buy. I really think some of the games and programs may be able to start utilizing some extra lanes of power they give us. The video processing is really fast, and I really like the USB3.0 for double write speeds versus USB2.0. I have switched many of my HDs to 2-3TB WD Passport drives with their smaller sized increase speed, and have dumped several larger hotter running HDs that are more affixed to the computer.If considering a new build, I would definitely stay with the LGA1150 genre. The parts for slightly older hi-tech items is dropping, while the newer parts for the i7-6700's seemed quite bit higher when I made this computer. RAM, video cards, motherboards, are all cheaper with this LGA1150 processor. I haven't compared specs, but the ones I see, are not big enough to warrant a higher payout for parts.

Supports UHD/4k Video well for office work.  Linux needs tweaks for refresh rate (fps) issues.

  I bought the i7 4790k to support a minimal build that needed to support a non-gaming 4k screen (Ultra High Definition actually - see notes below).My intent was to utilize the on chip video graphics to do this.  4k/UHD display standards are still emerging right now, so if you are planning to do the same do some research in advance.  I also wanted to use a 40 inch TV as my monitor to save a few bucks and get up to the size I wanted to use (40"").  I don't need 40"" of monitor, but with 4k/UHD pixel density and a screen that large, I can place my work windows in a position that does not induce fatigue after a long days work and have additional windows open around it with less used tools open and ready to go.If you are pursuing the same, I will make some notes you can use to get boot strapped into this little conquest.First, UHD and 4k are actually not the same resolution.  This is lost on some TV related web sites and advertising.  4k resolution is 4096 x 2160.  UHD is 3840 x 2160.  UHD is what TVs and UHD content will support.  UHD has 4x the pixels resolution of 1080i.  So to put some of this in perspective, a 40"" UHD TV has the equivalent of 4 20"" HD (1080i) screens in pixels.  And the pixel density of a 20"" HD monitor will be the same as 40"" UHD monitor.The only interfaces that support full 4k/USD resolutions right now are Displayport and HDMI.  The UHD TV's available right now don't support Displayport.  I purposely bought a mother board that supports Displayport to keep my options open going forward.You are going to need to find a TV capable of rendering the pixels without trying to enhance them for TV and Movie viewing.  The Samsung I purchased supports ""just render""/gaming mode if you learn about its odd setting requirements.  LG has a few that support this mode and there are a couple of Chinese manufacturers that do as well (Seiki and TLS).All of them overwhelmingly have HDMI 1.4 ports on them.  They don't include this spec on spec sheets unless they actually support 2.0.  Then they will brag about it as a feature.  The notable difference between these two specs is the frame refresh rate.  1.4 supports UHD up to 30 fps, 2.0 supports UHD up to 60 fps.Motherboard manufacturers are the same on this front and I cannot find any that claim to support HDMI 2.0.  They are at least more transparent about the resolutions and fps rates they support with onboard interfaces for HDMI so a little less hunting to confirm they are unable to support 2.0.The Displayport option supports @60 fps at 3840 x 2160 (UHD).  So that is an option going forward whenever converters for HDMI are released that support HDMI 2.0.  To do that I will still need to upgrade the TV.I use this computer for work related tasks so I don't have to have 60 fps.  I settled for a Samsung TV with hdmi 1.4 ports knowing I would be limited.  This particular model uses a proprietary Samsung port that allows for upgrades after purchase to latest features and capabilities in an external box.  Thats fine, and whenever Samsung offers this option with HDMI 2.0 I will purchase it if I think I really need it.The on chip display is doing a very good job @30 fps.  I am actually surprised by that given that it is still considered inferior to most reasonable pci video cards.  I left room for a pci video card if I need to use one at some point.  Right now I don't.If you are using Linux with Xserver/Xwindows like I am, the Xserver will auto select the first resolution the chipset driver lists that is compatible with the resolutions the hdmi port reports.  On my TV the hdmi does not list options to the OS.  So Xserver picks the very first resolution the driver for the on chip graphics lists and that is 3840 x 2160 @24 fps.  The TV refreshes @30 fps.  This will cause the two to be out of sync on refresh rate.  It won't be too obvious that something isn't right until you start to use your mouse or do something motion oriented like dragging something across the screen.  It will have a lot of lag.  Too much.With tweaks to your Xserver configuration you can over ride this in favor of using the 30 fps options it also supports.  Since making this adjustment I find the lag problem isn't there anymore.Last notes go to video performance.  I can see sheering on some videos.  Video is not awesome with this rig but tolerable when using 1080i resolution.  I test this in a 1/4 size window on you tube and set the video resolution to 1080i.  The video is reasonable but not good.  I have watched portions of 1080i movies and they were occasionally marred by sheering in the video window.  Occasionally a little frame lag.  That takes the onboard processor out of contention for a 4k/UHD home theater pc.  If I set the resolution on both the graphics card and the TV to 1080i its a lot better (no longer UHD at all.)  So still a contender in that resolution.Overall the the graphics on the 4790k are doing a great job for my office/work applications and that makes this chip a dead on hit for my requirements.  The video testing was for curiosity sake and given the frequency with which I would ever watch a video on this PC the performance on that front is acceptable.  I just wouldn't use it for a htpc build for UHD without also using a high performance pci graphics card.

  Its like what others have said in the comments below. The i7-4790K a.k.a Devil Canyon processor is just a factory overclocked version of the i7 4770K a.k.a  Haswell processor. Most will probably be able to achieve a 4.5 Mhz overclock stable and a few others might be able to achieve just a little bit more then that. Far from that 5.0 Mhz on air claim Intel was bragging about prior to release day.Prior to purchasing this processor I owned the Haswell i5 4570 and honestly I have not seen much of a difference in performance between my old Haswell i5 and my new Devil Canyon i7. Game wise, CPU intensive games like Planet Side 2, Day Z, Crysis 3, etc runs just about the same on both processors. Many people have said that the big differences over the i5 lies in applications like video editing, etc. so that is something to consider when deciding. That said, if you already have the previous generation Haswell processor i5 or i7 then the new Devil Canyon processor is not worth the upgrade. If your doing a new build or if you have a processor over a couple of generations old then by all means I am giving the i7-4790K two thumbs up!

The best value you could possibly hope for

  I love this thing. I upgraded from an AMD FX-8350 in the summer of 2015. The frame jump was so high that I didn't even realize that I hadn't enable the SLI for the second GTX 970 that I bought along with it. When it sits almost idle, doing small things, it floats around 4.0-4.1GHz. BUT, when you put it under stress(like playing any game or benchmarking it), it jumps up to a stable 4.3GHz. I even saw it sit at 4.4GHz on one benchmark. And the included cooler did a good job of keeping the temp stable when I ran three benchmarks in a row on the 3DMark software too. The stock cooler is actually extremely quiet, also. I love this processor and recommend that you just eat the upfront cost. For the performance it gives, it's entirely worth the money. Combine this with a GTX 970 and you can just about max out Crysis 3 and Fallout 4 at 1080p. Just about. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I don't even plan on upgrading to the 6th gen 6700K whatsoever. I'll just put in another GPU. The performance difference is extremely minimal, and with the cost of the LGA1151 and DDR4 stuff, this is the better value.

  Oh my god, so fastOverclocked it up to a super stable 4.9GHz, and it just cruises through everything. Combined with a fast SSD and enough RAM, this CPU just cuts through tasks like they are half as intense as they really are. The part about a fast ssd and enough ram is important though, because this CPU likely is never the limiting factor in any process or game, it destroys its part of most tasks. Paired with a 970 it crushes every game I play at 1080p, probably would go for a 980 or 980ti to maintain 60+ framerates at 1440p or above.This is pretty much the pinnacle of performance as far as 4 core processors go, for now, doesn't seem like Skylake 6000 series processors are too much faster.I could have easily gone for an i5-4690K instead, but my laptop had an i7 and gosh darn it, my badass PC would have hyperthreading as well. Besides, as time goes on, more and more applications will take advantage of the performance boost that hyperthreading offers, and since I intend to use this CPU for probably at the very least 3 years (5 more likely), having that extra capability is worth it to me.So fast!

  HO-LY S***! This thing is fast.I used this cpu for my elite gaming computer build. On paper this thing is supposed to give ""up to"" 4.1GHz out of the box, mine gave me exactly 4.0GHz. I'm not complaining, but lets be real, if 80-90% of your customers get 4.0GHz or less out of the box, just say that instead of giving me unrealistic expectations.I bought a nice cpu cooler(evo 212) and overclocked this bitch to 4.4GHz. It took me about 5 minutes and it was surprisingly easy to do. The temps are easily managed(28c idle maybe upper 30's when in ""full boom"") and gaming is a breeze. I can game hard for hours and watch HD vids at the same time and my cpu won't go past 30% capacity. This is easily the best processor I have ever owned.I would suggest one thing to people who are going to buy this. The stock cooler is a cheap piece of s***. If you are willing to spend ~$340 for this thing, its worth investing in a nice cooler. They aren't expensive and they quite noticeably improve performance and temps.I just became an Intel-processor customer for life.

Intel Core i7-4790K Haswell Quad-Core 4.0GHz

  I purchased this as part of a new desktop build using a Z97 chipset AsRock Extreme6 motherboard in a Corsair case. I picked this particular CPU for its combination of features (performance, power efficient, VT-x) over the AMD FX line (comparable features but not nearly as power efficient), Intel i7-5820K (more cores but lower performance per core), and a few other options. I probably would have been alright saving a few dollars and gone for the standard i7-4790 since I haven't really experimented with overclocking the CPU, but I have that option later if I have the time or inclination later. Paired with a Samsung SSD and 32 gbs of Crucial RAM, it tends to fly on most tasks.One note of warning: I started off using the stock Intel CPU cooler that it came with. I did some 1080p media transcoding using Handbrake and it pushed the CPU temperature up to a very scary 90 degrees Celsius. I stopped the job as soon as I saw it, and ordered a (series) of water coolers. With the Corsair H60 idle temperature is now under 25 degrees and maxes out at 56 degrees with a series of video encodes. I would definitely recommend getting a different CPU cooler.

  Not much here to be able to add to what already has been written about this wonderful CPU, but I can only echo the comments of others. This CPU is a real powerhouse both in speed and in processing capability. As this CPU runs pretty hot when fully loaded, anyone who uses this CPU to it's full capability will simply need to get another cooling solution beyond what is supplied in the Intel box, or you will experience thermal throttling due to the high temperatures generated. While this CPU can be easily overclocked by a Z97 Motherboard, it really does not have a lot of headroom for extreme overclocking. The current speed of 4.0 to 4.4 GHz is very fast as is. A really significant overclock to 4.8 GHz or better will require a serious investment in custom water cooling, or you have a very rare CPU. As for me, the CPU is fantastic at 4.4 GHz, and not sure I have a need to get any more speed out of it. I am using an old Enzotech Extreme CPU air cooler, testing with AIDA 64 Extreme to stress the CPU, and I am getting about 68"" C average temperature out of the CPU at full load, at 1.18 Volts Core. Ummmm.....maybe I will tweak it up a bit. Happy Computing...!!!

  This is a fantastic CPU! I wanted to build an ITX gaming rig and this processor should keep my system up to spec for many years into the future, especially with DirectX12 helping CPUs be more useful in games. I'm using an MSI Z97I AC motherboard with this chip. The MSI board lets me use an 'enhanced turbo' feature that makes the Intel Turbo Boost work on all the cores (up to 4.4Ghz). With a Noctua NH-D9L cooler I'm getting idle temps at 25-30C with the fan @ 1000rpm (very quiet) running the 4.4Ghz on all cores. I could overclock to get closer to 5.0Ghz but it is probably not worth it as this chip is already overkill for most apps and games. I'll be looking forward to what AMD is going to do with Zen, but for now this 4790K is the chip to have!

  It had been quite a while since I built a new desktop rig, and all I can say is.. holy crap, this thing is amazing. I have been an AMD guy all my life, but I loved the performance of my 3rd gen i7 laptop so much, I decided to move to intel for my desktop. This thing clocked in at just over 12,000 on the benchmark after I built it! It runs unbelievably fast and surprisingly cool using the stock air cooler. While writing this review, the temp is sitting at 38C... in other words, under a light load, it runs basically the same temperature as my body! Now, it does quickly get hot under avery heavy  load (80-100 while using Handbrake for x.264 encoding), but all in all, not bad. I will likely get an aftermarket cooler in the future, but I found that if I limit CPU speed in windows to 95%, it seems to do a great job of keeping the temp <85 and doesn't affect the performance much at all. I only do this because >85 really makes me nervous. All in all, I love it!

I've checked the Windows resource meter and I'm not even beginning to bog it down.Because I wasn't sure whether I needed it or not, I went with most internet recommendations and bought an aftermarket fan/heat sink that is much better than what comes with the processor. I don't overclock and I am now very confident that I did not in fact need that extra cooling.

  Power house, plain and simple. If you already have a socket 1150 motherboard and DDR3 DIMMs, there is not yet much point in upgrading to the i7-6700k or i7-7700k, as all 3 have roughly the same performance and the latter two would require a new motherboard and all new DDR4 DIMMs.If your 4790k doesn't overclock very well, learn why by Googling ""silicon lottery"", and look into swapping it with another somehow. They should overclock to ~4.5ghz with air cooling(use a tower cooler, not the stock cooler. Stock heatsink is small.)

  Outstanding for single thread performance - I only upgrade every few years, and you can really feel the benefit of not only a fast clock speed but also the incremental improvements in instructions per cycle. Compared to my 5 year old dual Xeon X5670 (12 cores, 2.93 Ghz) this is about ~85% faster for single threaded tasks. For multithreaded tasks this quad-core CPU performs as my old computer using 7 cores.  I do not play games, but the built in graphics are sufficient for volume rendering, and the graphics driver support for Linux seems solid. I did not overclock my unit - so I can not comment on that. However, for stock performance this is a blazingly fast CPU. I used a basic Rosewill RCX-ZAIO-92 cooler and this provides reasonable temperatures without generating much noise.

  Great processor in the 1150 chipset. I didn't realize how big a difference it would make going from an AMD 8350 to this. Games that wouldn't run on the 8350 ran great on this. I thought there was something wrong with Crysis or Mass Effects port to PC. It was that the 8350 wasn't good enough. The memory and gpu being the same or very close the only reason for the huge difference in playability was this chipset. I should have known because I had Crysis running on an older I7 960 with an old 1 gig gpu( really old 5 years old). If you want to game and want something that will probably work well for the next few years this is a good choice. Save your pennies, don't buy AMD, the difference between this and the FX8350 is night and day. I leave OC on auto and use the stock fan, it gets warm buy survives for now, eventually Ill get a 90mm cooler from Noctua.

Some mention has been made of the on-board graphics capabilities of this chip. While waiting on my GPU to arrive I went ahead and bumped the speeds of both the CPU (+10%) and the RAM (currently @ 2400 MHz). I was amazed - you could orbit a shaded complex SU model without a single hitch (monitor resolution 1920x1080). I have not mapped materials as I very rarely do that anyway. A modestly complex BIM model refreshes instantly with 3 open viewports. I now think I only need the GPU to watch HD video. Just make sure you get the latest INTEL graphics driver.

  up to this point, the CPU is truly fast an is able to fulfill 60 fps on my gaming rig on my gtx980 with quality maxed out while recording with Fraps. i recommend getting a premium heat sink for this CPU because it is Overclockable and (unlocked) for better turbo-boosting (because its an I7) and quieter cooling. but it does come with a stock air heat sink.3797 on Fire Strike Ultra/ Intel Core i7-4790K/ NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980my processor in benchmarks returned this.Reported stock core clock  4,000 MHzMaximum turbo core clock  4,400 MHzPhysical / logical processors  1 / 8# of cores  4Package  LGA1150TDP  88 W

Good choice for high performance computing.
","

  Pretty good choice.  I was going to make sure I can run virtualization (Windows 7 and Oracle VirtualBox) and I can with this one.  The BIOS has some additional features that are enabled due the ""K"" designation of the CPU.  I could not be happier with my choice.  The fan that comes with the CPU is probably the noisiest fan inside of my case, but since it is inside of the case, I guess it is reasonable.  If I need to overclock, I will buy a different fan, but certainly not for the noise it is making as it is completely tolerable.  I decided to go with the Video built in to the CPU (Intel 4600) and did not buy a separate video card.  Win7 Performance Index for video is 6.7, far better than what I was getting on my old machine.  Processor performance Index is 7.8 (maximum possible performance index number is 7.9 which is what I'm getting on my Samsung 840 EVO SSD)

","

  I am writing this review on my multi-media rig. I am a casual gamer, digital illustrator, typical web surfer, film buff, and novice game-streamer on Twitch. Granted, I invested money into my motherboard, fans, gpu, sound card, etc.- this cpu makes the most sense for price to performance. I built my own rig- and it is a beast. This cpu handles all I throw at it with grace. I'm sure there are better cpus in the X99 platforms- but seriously, look at how expensive the platform is and the gains are hardly noticeable to the average consumer. If you are a gamer, surfer, streamer, and average enthusiast- this is all you need.

Good for overclocked gaming and/or 3D workstations
","

  Most current chip for 1150 socket is great. Also called Devil's Canyon, the chip is easy to overclock with Asus' Duel Intelligent software -- it's best to overclock with this software, rather than from within the bios-- that comes with the 97-a board (you don't need to use this board, but it is cheap and easy to overclock). Cost effective for the amount of processing you get, especially if you are working with 3D modeling programs that utilize the CPU more that the GPU such as Revit. You can get away with not having a discrete GPU since this chip has graphic capability built in, but I am assuming that most people would be getting this chip for gaming or working in 3D design/rendering, so discrete GPU would be a must.Runs well, no major issues, fast, easy to install, pretty straight forward. Additionally, if you want to overclock, go with something Corsair H100i instead of the in box heat sink unit.

It is GREAT, except for that cooler.

  Great CPU, renders videos extremely fast for me. Overall great CPU. THE ONLY THING IS THAT COOLER. I have never said this before as the stock cooler for my previous CPU and APU have been fine (as in not annoying loud in my opinion). But for this one please do yourself a favor and get a aftermarket cooler. I personally have not yet because of financial reasons but when I am rendering videos or playing a Cities Skyline that fan is so loud. And it is really ineffective when the CPU is being stressed at those levels. My PC does not crash but 80c-85c is not cool. During normal gaming it almost never goes over 60c however and sounds fine. But since I render videos for YouTube frequently it does get a bit annoying.

Runs hot with stock cooler
","

  It's very fast and a great value. Hard to say much more about it than that.My one complaint is that it runs VERY HOT with the stock fan/heat sink installed. Even without overclocking, the stock cooler couldn't keep it under 90-95C at full load, which is totally unacceptable. I reseated it and cleaned/reapplied thermal compound multiple times just to make sure it wasn't my mistake. A gigantic third party heat sink (Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO) brought the temperature down to about 65C, which seems to be about as good as it gets for this processor without liquid cooling. It's not a huge additional expense, but it makes me wonder why they include the stock cooler at all. It's just extra stuff to throw away, and I bet it could have been a few bucks cheaper without it.

  I built a new performance desktop and used this processor.  It has plenty of power so I didn't even bother to overclock it, just leaving it in turbo mode.

  This processor is a beast!  Without getting one of Intel's extreme processors this processor is by far the fastest gaming processor money can buy.  It pretty much comes pre-overclocked.  If you are an overclocking enthusiast you might want to check if this is truly your bottleneck because I haven't found a way to bottleneck this processor yet that isn't simply a prime number generator.

This thing is a BEAST (in the best way possible)

  This processor is a beast. I needed a new server setup for the streaming, syncing, live security camera capture, transcoding, software RAID parity calculation, and a bunch of other stuff I recently decided to add. My old dual core would just outright stall and require a hard reboot to come back up. With this processor, I don't think I've ever seen it go above 70% utilization. It's quick, efficient, and if I need to downclock a bit for more efficiency or cooling I can due to the unlocked multiplier.I can only imagine what this would do in a gaming or editing build. It's probably massively overpowered for most people (even most gamers would be hard pressed to need more than an i5 k series chip), but for those that will benefit from it... get it!

Runs Too Hot!! Need Liquid Cooler!
","

  I reluctantly give this product 5 stars, not because there is anything wrong with the product itself, but instead because of the stock heatsink provided. It's horrible, to say the least.Upon booting my PC after installation the fan wound up, into what I can only imagine was the fastest RPM it could pull. During this wind up, it made the most horrible noise, as if a race car was driving through my house. Once it leveled out at roughly 37c, the fan lowered its RPM's, but it was still incredibly loud, I could hear it over the YouTube videos about replacement options for said fan.When I tried to run Rainbow Six: Siege, the CPU heated up to 105c, and averaged 100c. This was without any overclocking, 16gb RAM, and an R9 390x, plus 2 extra fans in my case.I realized that for any CPU usage, a air cooler just wouldn't do for this CPU. I immediately bought a Corsair Hydro H100i GTX. Upon installation/boot, I didn't hear a whisper of a noise. The CPU idles at around 27c, and running Rainbow Six: Siege/Assassin's Creed: Syndicate/GTA V/Fallout 4 (All on ultra settings) - the CPU never exceeded 60c, and idles around 55c for said games.So the product is incredible, it is what's on the box. The downside is, please do your research for a proper cooling solution that will fit your case. There is no way that the stock cooler will work in any condition at all, and it's literally pointless for them to include it.I debated on leaving 4 stars, because I feel that the product should be marketed in a way to let people know upfront that they will have to invest in a decent cooler (more expenses down the line) to get the product to function as intended. But, I gave it 5 stars because it's just that good of a CPU.

It out performs just about every other processor all the way up to the gen 6 i7's in it's class of quad cores.With a well rounded build you can run a music production studio suite while simultaneously gaming and/or performing other tasks that are considered ""high-stress"" for your system. If finding compatible motherboards wasn't an issue, and I were given the option between this processor and some of the newer gen 7's even, I would opt for this same 4790K processor in builds moving forward.

  I am a game developer, so I needed some pretty good specs. This right here is the best processor you can get before you need a $250 mobo and DDR4 RAM. During the first whole day of me installing software, this did not even go above 35% usage. I have yet to have any complaints about this, and I am just running it at 4.2 GHz. My boot time with this is less than 15 seconds after I push the power button, and love it!

  Nice...Have mine over clocked to 4.6MHz and it runs stable and cool.Have had for 7 months now and did do some overclocking...Highest speed I got was 4.9 MHz.  It did run warm withe watercooling at that speed but was stable and had no crashes.  I now keep it at 4.7MHz as it runs cool (45 celsius) and everything is silent, cool and not over taxing.My 4790k is plugged into a Asus Z97 Pro with Wifi/AC and I couldn't be happier with the match.  I can have a high performance setting, or just a quick speed that is stable and very smooth.

Flawless.
","

  Flawless. Incredible performance for the price.  The proper way to select a processor is to go a CPU benchmark list and decide on your performance per price number.  Google CPU benchmark list.I ought to mention a couple of things about processors and overclocking.  Many similar chips in a processor family are the exact same thing.  They are tested at the factory, and the resulting stable setting is then reduced, and locked at a certain frequency and then labeled as a 4770, 4790, etc.  The K at the end indicates the frequency is set but unlocked, so you can overclock it via BIOS.  For this particular processor (4790K) you will still have variances.  Many many of them can be stably overclocked to 4.4 GHz and then go up or down and see what your limit is.  It seems that 4.8GHz is the golden goose for this processor, even on water cooling.The way to overclock is to set the frequency and manually set the vcore voltage to a recommended level, then slowly reduce the voltage until it crashes under test, then slowly go up a little and stress for at least 8 hours.Paired this processor with an Asus Maximus VII Hero, 16GB Adata 2400MHz RAM, an Arctic Freezer 13 cooler, 256GB SSD, and an Asus GTX 970.  From the formatting of the hard drive, I started the Windows 7 Pro installation and was up and running on my desktop in 12 minutes!!  12!Stock at 4.0GHz, I was able to get mine stable during stress testing at 4.8GHz on air, but the temps were upper 80s C, pushing the thermal shutdown limits.  However, I would get random shutdowns at other times.I backed it down to 4.6GHz and got it very stable, but under stress it would still be low 80s C.  Very seldom random shutdowns at other times.  Due to some problems during 4K gaming I cross-checked and stressed each and every component in my computer and found my aging power supply to be the culprit.  I attribute this to noisy voltage which may have caused those shutdowns during overclocking testing.Regardless, 4.6 and 4.8GHz were running too hot on air, and I want my processor to last a long time, so I went back to stock 4.0GHz with turbo at 4.4.  It now runs 59C max, and there is almost no change in framerates when overclocked.  So really it was just an exercise in overclocking.  If you have a great water cooler, more power to ya.I have been completely pleased with my Arctic Freezer 13 cooler (rated at 200W cooling) by the way.  It met the power requirements and size to fit in my nMediaPC case.

  I don't OC, but this processor can be overclocked reliably to at least 4.4GHz and above.  The stock fan cools fine, even when playing high-end games like Far Cry4 and CoD Ghosts; Advanced Warfare, etc.  It does not go above about 60C, and cools rapidly to about 28-35C @idle.  I bought this i7 because of it's stock speed, and because I won't OC it, and want fast stock equipment that is reliable. Also, it is one of the reasons my Windows Experience Index has climbed to 7.8--even though the processor is the lowest score I have. I am running a 2666MHz FSB and RAM on a Z97 platform with a SSD and a GTX970, and expect it to be very front-running for years to come. I looked long and hard for the right processor, and believe I have found it!  Though it is ""only"" a quad-core, it doesn't lack any performance I can see in a usage environment.  There will always be higher performance numbers--but This proc. didn't cost a grand either.  Some say it gets hot; not so with stock settings.

  Very fast CPU. Doesn't hesitate to open anything at all. Unzipped files using WinRAR and it extracts files at blazing speed. This thing at idle runs nice and cool. I have a Cooler Master Seidon 120M liquid cooler installed and it runs around 34-37 Celsius during idle. Liquid cooling only shines when you're overclocking. But in terms of speed and processing power, this thing will not lag on you.  This will rip through any conversion and extraction of files. Buy It. If you're on a tight budget, then maybe an i5-4690K will suffice. But if you have the money, this thing is very future-proof and will be reliable for many years to come.Overclocking:I overclocked it using an Asus Z97-A motherboard. It was able to achieve 4.7ghz at 1.245 volts. Runs steady and fast. Temperature was running at the high 70's to low 80's. I have a poor mid-ATX case, so a good case with lots of fans will definitely be able to achieve a greater overclock. I used AIDA64 to run the stress test for a good 10-15 minutes. Temperatures ran around high 70's to low 80's all 4 cores. That was hot, and it was my limit. Temperatures in my room were in the 80's.To get to 4.8ghz, i had to increase the voltage to 1.30. That's a big jump in voltage for just 100 mhz extra. And my CPU was running too hot, so i didn't want to risk it. Anything below 1.30 volts didn't even get me to the desktop. It'll just blue screen and restart on me. Definitely needs a lot of juice power if you're overclocking to 4.8ghz. And as a personal preference, having fans blow directly on the CPU cools a lot better than a fan that blows hot air out. Fresh, cold air blowing directly at the CPU is always a plus. Downside is it'll build up dust a lot faster. A fabric softener installed in front of the fan to catch the dust will suffice.Side note:UPGRADE YOUR COOLING SYSTEM!!! Liquid cooling is preferred. Air coolers are good. But you will always get better speed with liquid coolers. Without overclocking, this CPU runs at 4.0ghz and temperatures reach around mid 60's to low 70's. And that's only at 4.0ghz. So definitely buy a cooling system.

  Have been looking forward to upgrading my i5 to an i7 and finally got the money together to do it. I had checked out possible upgrades including a better i5 but decided that I wanted an i7 and chose this one based on reviews and product information. I have a Dell Inspiron 3847 that came with a i5 4460 running at 3.2 gigs. I don't overclock so I wanted something that would run faster without having to overclock it. This seemed the best bet for me. I made up my mind when I brought a i3 system running at 3.7 gigs. This little system had a bit of zip to it and it, so far, has run most anything I could throw at it along with it's GTX-750 Ti SC graphics card. So I ordered the i7 and it came in right on time and I opened the shipping box to see what I had. The first thing I noted was the included heat sink fan combo that came with it. It was OK, but plastic push pins have failed me before as mounts on the case fans so that I didn't like. Also it was about half an inch thick and the heat sink fan combo on the existing i5 CPU was about an inch or over tall and had much larger fins. I did note that the heat sink combo that came with the i7 had a copper surfaced contact area where the heat sink seated on the CPU but the pins and size made me decide to stay with my i5's old heat sink cooler that came with the system. (I also noted that the i5 combo mounted to the MB with already mounted screws so if I needed to I could still switch combos a bit easier. (This didn't turn out to be the case, however.) So I got the Inspiron and brought it to the kitchen table where I do any inside-the-case computer work and removed the side panel and got busy. Laying it flat and grounding myself well, I proceeded to remove the heat sink fan combo with the only problem being it took a bit of force to get the screws holding down the heat sink to come loose as they were tightened down really well. After getting the screws loose, I checked out the mounting for the fan heat sink combo to see how it had been mounted so I could make sure and replace it properly. I like the way the heat sink was held down with four springs which push the heat sink down onto the top surface of the processor and provide a very firm fit after you've got the heat sink compound on. (I used Artic Silver which works for me.) The one thing that surprised me a bit was the amount of force that was needed to re-latch the hold down clip. It was a bit more than I felt it should be, but after checking how the i5 felt it wasn't all that much force to latch it. (Made sure to get the new chip in right too.) After I got the heat sink compound on and replaced the heat sink combo, and got it tightened down firmly. it was time to see what it would do. I normally leave the side panel off till I check out any new installation I do. In that way you can find any problems and correct them. The last thing I did was re-plug the heat sink fan back into the MB and then took the system to the Computer Room and hooked everything up. I turned the power on and went to the BIOS as a check to see if the CPU was seen correctly and it was with all functions showing OK. I then got the only glitch of the hold morning when I exited the BIOS and instead of booting to Windows10 Pro, it just shut down. Ops, I said to myself and  pressed the power button again. This time the system started up with no problems and booted right into Windows. I noted it felt sort of like my i3 in that it seemed to zip into Windows instead of sort of ""walking"" in. I had been reading that these i7s were noted for running a bit hot, so I ran Speccy and checked the temps. At idle it ran at 35 to 36c and under load it topped out at 65c and that was lower than what I expected it to be. A very pleasant surprise indeed. I got another one when I checked the actual speed the i7 was running at. It settled in at 4.2 gigs. and I hadn't done anything but install it. I sat there and watched the temps for a bit and noted that they didn't get above 40c when idling and when I loaded it down it just stayed around 65c with only one time peaking out at 68c. It seems I might have done a fair job with the sink heat fan combo too. I then loaded up one of my favorite games (Remember Me) and got killed off right away as I failed to respond quickly enough as I was expecting the AI to be a bit slower. Nice! Overall the system ""feels"" solid and runs that way. I note it has the ""zippy"" feel the i3 has but more so. In my games, I'm finding myself having to react a bit sooner than I used to and that's really a pleasure. So far, the only thing that popped up was the shut down at the first boot up after installing the CPU. It's not given me any other problems at all and it's nice to have things actually load up when clicked on without any little pauses and have the game scene transition loads go by so fast that you can't even read the hints anymore. Very Nice! One other thing that I was happy to see was when I checked the activation status of Windows 10 Pro and found it was still activated! Another very good thing to see! Overall I think I got a real winner here!Update: 4/17/16: One thing I did notice with this CPU was that, at first, it was a bit unstable and ran a bit warm. I noted the first time it booted up a slight freeze then reboot and then Windows came up. The first set up was this way and then I started having freezes, lockups, and unannounced reboots running at 4.3 gigs. It seemed my first impressions were a bit high. I did a reset of the heat sink compound and tried again. Same thing at 4.3 gig. After placing my old i5 3.2 gig back in for a check and it running just fine, I decided to try once again. I removed the i5 and put in the i7. This time I cleared the BIOS as I had run into having old BIOS values mess me up at times. I also added a 120mm fan to the case's left side to set up a bit more air flow thru the case. I reseated my sound card and graphics card, and I made sure all cables were tight. This time when I booted up, the system did not hang but booted to the screen informing me a BIOS clear at been done. It was smooth and there wasn't a hang to it. I went into the BIOS and disabled the on board sound and that's it, I left everything else like it was and booted into Windows 10 Pro. Windows booted up without a problem and loaded fine. I cranked up the Intel Extreme Tuning Ulit, and checked things out. Turned out I was again running at 4.2 gig. The system seemed OK, but was some of the readings looked a bit off to me, so I decided to try a test and sure enough the system seemed to be a little shaky to me. I decided on another test before I ran any stress tests. I set the system at 4 gigs solid and observed the readings. Things seemed to setting down and the temps seemed to stabilize around 35 to 40c. Not as low as hoped but in range. Since I hadn't planned on an overclock anyway, this would be OK IF they didn't get much higher. I then ran 10 minutes worth of CPU stress and memory tests after a 5 minute benchmarking in Intel's uitil., and then a 10 minute stress test under OCCP and the system sailed thru them all with the temps never getting above 83c but just spiking to it and no locking up, freezing or reboots. I've noted it seems to run around 35-40c when idling and around 70-76c under load. The main thing now is it seems very stable at 4 gigs for me and that's what I wanted even if it took me a little while to get there.Update: 7/18/16: OK, so here's the finally setup I had to run with. First, turned Turbo-boost  OFF in BIOS. Second, ran Intel Extreme Tuning Tool and set CPU core voltage on this system at 1.1005 volts, with Manual static setting only as that was the setting that got me the most stable running. (No Adaptive as, on my system, this causes lock ups and reboots when sudden voltage spikes up or down hit the CPU.) In this set up, the system is very stable, runs cool (Around 35-40c idle and 50-60c under load) and allows me to run my games and any thing else without any problems at all. The only problem that I run into every once in awhile is when somehow the static setting gets switched back to the adaptive set up and I don't spot it in time, I'll get the total system lock up and need to reboot by the power button on the system, otherwise no problems and system runs very solid without problems. (I've play one game 12 to 24 hours without a problem with the static setup.) (Think that Intel should allow the user to ""set"" the most stable profile ae the ""default"" profile for their system but they don't.) I maybe should have got the ""locked"" 4790 but I wanted the 4 gigs running speed and not 3.6. Still think it's a really good buy.

Runs cool for me
","

  This processor is amazing.  I read some reviews on it that said it runs very hot which gave me some concern; however, with the stock fan, I'm doing light work like browsing the web and hovering around 27C.  Bioshock Infinite gave me a steady 75C on Ultra mode, and Star Citizen runs about 68C.  I did order some Arctic Silver 5 and put some on my the cover of the processor (no deliding needed) before installing the fan, so that might be helping.  Considering the price of this CPU, 10 more bucks seems well worth it.I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it.  I've been playing Star Citizen in the highest graphics mode, hooked up to an Oculus Rift at 1900res, and this processor has been handling it extremely well. Great buy for a gamer.

  If you need an i7, 4790k is as good as it gets, at least before the 6xxx series came out!The 4790k reports 10% better single core performance, and performance per dollar is around 2.5x better. If you are using it for gaming, I highly recommend going for an i5 for the cost saving, as i7 does very little for gaming overall.Overall the 6700k is about 5-10% higher performance ignoring the single core, which is becoming less relevant as more applications utilize it.

  This bad boy dropped to $289.00 during black Friday. I finally couldn't say no to upgrading my old rig (an almost 6 year old AMD Athlon X3 [yeah that's right, triple core!])After graduating college I finally have a job that can afford me to build something a little nicer than a budget rig. So I splurged on this beast of a cpu and paired it with an ASUS Hero VII Z97 motherboard.To be real with you, the last time I built a rig I had a techie friend with me who kind of babied me through it. I didn't even have half the amount of money sunk into that setup as I do this one... so doing it friendless was terrifying.By that I mean my friend wasn't there. I have friends. I swear.I purchased a Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212 to slap on top and make an ""Arctic Silver 5"" sandwich. Can I just say there is something supremely horrifying about hearing the creek of a $200 motherboard as I tighten the screws on a heat sink over a $300 processor?Luckily, I did not destroy the setup. Turns out they build this stuff to survive the clumsy hands of a novice such as myself.I planned on overclocking this chip (or else why get the k?) but it's so darn fast right now I just don't feel motivated too. I'm enjoying a stock 4ghz hyper threaded quad-core CPU at an idle of 34-35 degrees and a load of about 60-65. Ran Prime95 and the chip would barely blip above 68 degrees.I truly couldn't be happier with this chip. I'm sure I'll eventually get crazy and start overclocking it... but I just can't think of a practical reason to overclock a chip that is so dang fast on it's own.Look, this is an expensive chip. But you get what you pay for with Intel. AMD is great for a budget rig, but I couldn't be happier with this purchase.I might be eating ramen noodles for dinner for the next month (they don't pay elementary school teachers that much) but at least I'll eat ramen while enjoying my computer time that much more.(Btw... this is unrelated. But add a dash of sriracha sauce to your ramen noodles. I was super impressed with the extra dash of flavor.)

Great Performance for the Price! Custom PC Builder with MSI MATX Gaming Motherboard, with OC Stats - Recommend Water Cooler
","

  I purchased this for my first custom PC. Since I just got into some research with protein modeling, I had to stray away from Apple and my MacBook Air in favor of a faster and more heat-reliable system. Since I knew I didn't want to upgrade for a few years, I spent more than I normally would have on the CPU. I figured, spend more money now but save in the long run was my best option. I have this CPU water cooled with a H90i Corsair closed-loop block, which I would highly recommend also. The stock fan was pretty loud and inefficient especially in my MATX case where heat sitting in the small case with a graphics card was just a terrible setup. In a full sized ATX case this may not be as much as an issue, but I would definitely upgrade to a high performance CPU fan at minimum (roughly 40-50 dollars), or a water cooler if you're willing to spend about 70-100 dollars.As for overclocking, I was able to get this stable at 4.7GHz and successfully stress-test for 48 hours. I can push this to 4.8GHz and 4.9GHz but it became unstable to the point it would crash and produce a lot of heat, even with water cooling. The stress testing would produce such a jump in heat within the first 10 seconds that it would crash before my water cooling system could react from the previously idle temperatures. The only wait 4.7GHz or more is sustainable is to either be extremely lucky with your CPU, since they are not all created equal but rather grouped, or run your fans at 100% at all times. The difference between 4.7GHz and 4.9GHz isn't noticeable where this would be worth it, unless your benchmarking for competitions, as I was. I couldn't obtain 5GHz at all under any conditions. Note: the maximum reliable clock speed will vary between each 4790K processor. To my knowledge, about a +/- 0.4GHz variation is possible. Some users only manage two obtain 4.4GHz why others can achieve 4.8GHz, while retaining stability. Some companies actually screen hundreds of these and sell the winning 1%, per se, that can obtain 5.0GHz, which is pretty rare to my knowledge.Overall, this processor is an extremely good buy considering the performance versus cost ratio. The LGA 1150 socket that it utilizes offers countless options for motherboards with varying price ranges. The LGA 1150 motherboards are typically less expensive than the newer LGA 2011 sockets. For me, the unlocked multiplier was the selling point. In my system, I use a MSI MATX Gaming motherboard with 4x8GB DDR3 ram sticks. The only benefit of buying a LGA 2011 socket processor, in my eyes, is the benefit of DDR4.

I use this CPU for CFD analysis - disabled Hyper threading and it churns out the iterations even with a 10 million cell count!!! Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed.

Wow
","

  Pros: Super fast in both multi-threaded and single-threaded tasks. Idles extremely cool. Strangely cool in fact, but in a good way.Cons: Not quite the OC'er Intel wanted us to think it was. But has 4.0 stock & 4.4GHz boost, so that's ok. Runs warm when OC'ed.I have to say that overall I am extremely pleased with my i7 4790k purchase and it's performance. It is so incredibly fast, and is actually just a hair shy of a $500 i7 3930k in most tasks which says a lot. That really is a big deal for a $300 proc.The 4790k idles strangely cool, in the low 20's (C) with my Corsair H80i, and is about 8-10C cooler than an i7 4770k at idle all things being equal. And it stays around 45-48C under work load such as gaming, etc. It is a real beast of a processor.However, overclocking is not as great as we thought it would be. I think Intel's early claims of a new improved TIM and voltage regulation was an exaggeration, and it still doesn't come close to Sandy Bridge's fluxless solder IHS. It may be better than the Haswell version 1.0, I'll give you that - but it's still not ""that great."" I forsee some serious delidding going on over the next few months on DC and much-much testing.

  I did a fair amount of research before I bought this processor and I decided to go for it for several reasons.  It was unlocked (meaning I can choose to overclock it if I want), a lot of people have overclocked it and had it run very stable even on air.  I'm not an overclocker but I like buying overclocking processors because if they are meant to be overclocked and run stable, they should run very stable if you don't overclock it.  It also has a very high clock speed which may me choose this over several other i7s and i5s.  For not much more money, you can get this beast.After installing it in my new motherboard (Asrock z97 Fatal1ty) and 8 GB of ram (I know, not much but enough to make it run), i got windows 7 ultimate installed and everything seemed to work well.  I should mention that I used the stock cooler that came with the processor (which are usually known to not be great, but usually they work well enough).  At one point, I decided to head into the bios and make sure everything checked out correctly.  That's when I noticed the processor temp.  It was idling at around 40-45 C!!!  I thought that it seemed a little strange and I wanted to try pushing the processors and see where the temperatures would level off at.So I downloaded a tool called Core Temp to monitor the processor temps from within windows.  Then I downloaded Prime 95 and tried running a stress test to see where the temps would go.  Immediately after starting the test, the temps jumped to 75C (within a second or two) and after about 4 seconds I was getting warnings about the CPU temp reaching dangerous levels.  I quickly stopped the stress test.This got me thinking, I wonder if I didn't seat the heat sink down properly.  After checking the heat sink I decided it was down completely and I turned the computer on again, only to see the same extremely high temps.  At that point, I decided to remove the heat sink, clean off the stock thermal compound and apply arctic silver 5.  After re-installing everything and turning the computer on, the temps seemed about 10 degrees cooler all around.  Unfortunately, about 10 seconds in to the Prime 95 stress test, the temps jump up to 80 + degrees.  Still too hot for my comfort.  I've read quite a few reviewers that said they overclocked to 4.5 and 4.6 GHz on just the stock cooler so I'm not sure why mine is running so hot.Despite the processor running this hot I still gave it 4 out of 5 starts for the value at the given price point.  Stock coolers tend to be okay at best and perhaps my processor just runs a little hotter than most (or maybe all the 4790Ks run hotter) but this is a problem that is easily fixed by buying an aftermarket air cooler.  I've ordered the Cooler Master 212 EVO which is a beast compared to the stock cooler.  I have no doubt that installing it will drop my temps down at least 20 degrees under load (maybe more).  It only cost about 30 bucks and I don't consider it a huge problem (hence only dropping 1 start off the processor).I just wanted to post some temps of my processors here for other people to see so they have something to compare their processor to.  If yours is running hot like mine, try a different aftermarket cooler like the cooler master 212 EVO (or many others out there).  If I remember, I'll try it out and come back to update my review with the temps from the new heat sink.One last note, my processor was made in Vietnam and the numbers on the processor are: SR219  X432A796.  It was purchased in October of 2014 for any who are interested in which batches are being sold now.

Great CPU for daily usage

  It's a high performance desktop-grade processor, and obviously it's from Intel, it's not like there's a competition anywayIt's a great CPU if you're like me, aiming to get a reliable and relatively high performance out of it.If you're too much into overclocking stuff, it's not that ""fun"" since there's a small thermal headroom, so getting a mere 600mhz boost on air cooling looks kind of impossible. On stock clocks it's cool and my cpu fan never maxes out.

Sweet processor! Definitely overkill for a basic home user
","

  I got the 4790K for my new build, replacing a 4.5 year old i5-2500K.  This is a pretty amazing processor; most likely overkill for a lot of users, but perfect for people who want the best.  For me, in day to day tasks, I can't really tell a huge difference between my old i5 and this. They're both rocket-fast paired with a SSD.  The difference shows, however, in a gaming environment. The only game I use is Flight Simulator X, which is a CPU-intensive title as compared to other games that rely more on GPU.  For Flight Sim, you get the fastest CPU you can afford if you want the best performance, and you can even skimp a bit on your video card. Although I set a fixed frame rate in Flight Sim, with it at unlimited I get in the 80s at ultra high (tweaked) settings, compared to the 60s with the i5.  Mind you this is with a less powerful video card - a GT740 SC 4GB DDR5 as opposed to a GTX650Ti.  The comparison isn't apples to apples, and would likely be a bit higher with the same card.  Closing words - if you are a gamer, and you want fast, get this. If you do other things that demand huge processing power, get this. If you're a home office user, you're overspending if you get this. Get a Core i5 or even a Core i3 and you'll still be zipping along, but for a lot less cash.

  My downstairs PC was a very old 2.6Ghz 4GB Core2 Duo circa 2008 that I upgraded piecemeal at times (Win7, more drives, etc).  I realized it's performance was holding me back and I had done the frugal ""get your value out of an older device"" thing long enough.  I looked at all the current options, including Skylake and X99 40 lane motherboard / chip combos.  I finally settled on this, MSI extreme 7, Samsung EVO 850 Pro SSD, 16gig Gskill RAM and Noctua CPU fan 

Noctua Premium Quality Quiet CPU Cooler for Intel LGA 2011,1156,1155,1150 and AMD AM2/AM2+/AM3/3+,FM1/2 Sockets NH-U9S

  .  Boy am I glad I did!  It's just NIGHT and DAY faster than my old system.  Nothing crashes anymore, I have simply thrown a battleship's worth of resources at the problem and hey IT WORKS.  Surfing, telecommuting no longer has any lag.  The thing resumes from sleep in less than 2 seconds.P.S.  it's running just fine with an older Seasonic 550 watt power supply.  I am using a modest, older AMD video card (6670)  as gaming is not my focus.  My CPU temperature hovers at 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) when just surfing but multiple windows open.  Surfing performance would probably get even better with a GTX 950 Strix videocard which I may purchase in near future.

Buy this instead of the 4790 non-K. You won't be disappointed.
","

  At the time of this writing there are 1,030 other reviews, many of them quite detailed, so I'll keep it brief. If you are incrementally upgrading your PC, this is the best deal going, period. Previously I was running an i5 2500k. In order to upgrade I had to purchase a new motherboard, owing to the 1150 vs 1151 cpu slot. But I was able to re-purpose my  (expensive) existing 16GB of RAM. Moving up to the next level of processor would have required replacing all of my DDR3 RAM with DDR4. And the MoBo's are more expensive. I figure it would have cost me an additional $400-$500 to realize maybe 10-15% faster performance. No brainer for me.I paired it with an ASUS MoBo, this one...

ASUS ATX DDR3 2600 LGA 1150 Motherboards Z97-A/USB 3.1

  . This allowed me to easily leverage the overclocking potential of the chip. Using the auto OC function of the BIOS, I have been able to achieve Passmark scores in the 12000 range, basically the same as the $100 more expensive  i7-3930K (and don't forget the added costs).All in all I'm super happy with this CPU. Definitely spend the extra couple of bucks for this rather than the non-K version. It's well worth your $$$, and even if you know nothing about OC'ing, there are plenty of MoBo's that will do it for you. It's free performance.Earns my official seal of approval.

  I upgraded from an old Core i3 530. This absolutely blows it away, as you'd expect.Converting blu-rays to x.265 using Handbrake with RF ~20 using the ""medium"" preset I get a little over 12 frames per second on average (no overclock). I tried the ""slow"" preset and was getting 5-6 fps, which is too slow to maintain my sanity. I never even bothered trying video conversion on my old i3 so I don't really have anything to compare it with.I'm using a Corsair Hydro H80i GT for cooling and it idles around 84F (~70F ambient). Peak temperature while encoding (CPU between 95 and 99% usage) seems to be 127F. Not using any special thermal grease.I tried the auto-overclock option in my motherboard's bios and that just forced the cores to their turbo-boost speed of 4.4 Ghz. Haven't played with any *real* overclocking yet.Can't wait to get a i7-6950X and see what that can do. :-)

  Intel i7-4790K will always be good from now and for the next three years or more. Is it worth 300 USD? Let me say that price is relevant to cost of aggravations. Suffice it for me to say that no aggravation and long term satisfaction is worth something, so yes, in my opinion the i7-4790K processor is worth the cost, even if you do not plan to overclock it. Why would you buy this over the lesser yet nearly equivalent i5-4690K? If you have the need for multithreaded simultaneous operations, this processor is hands down light years faster than an i5-4690K. If you are surfing the web or playing games with your system then you probably do not need this processor and the i5-4690K is a much better economical option. Why would I buy a K rated processor over a standard version if I do not plan to overclock it? Simply because they are better processors. When processors are tested, they must pass a myriad of tests before they are marked and shipped. Every processor is guaranteed to operate within the window of specifications, so when you buy one that will outperform the window of specifications, it simply tested better overall.

  Performance is good. Other reviewers have covered this in great detail so I won't go in depth, but it's a powerful little processor. Overclocks well, but the standard clock is more than enough to handle just about anything I can throw at it.My only complaint (and it's a big one, a deal breaker for me)... Much as professional reviewers found in youtube reviews, is the thermal problems. Man does this thing get hotter than any processor I've ever had before, and WAY hotter than it advertises. It can be overcome by de-lidding apparently, but I am not going there. Even with this high end water cooling setup, it idles high and nearly maxes out when doing much with it. It stays *slightly* within safe zones, but barely. I had hoped the reviews here were more in line with real world use/reality, but it seems at least with the one I got, the YouTube reviews were more in line with real world. Shame, because like I said, it's a powerful piece of hardware. Many overcome the thermal problems by de-lidding like I said, but I am not interested in going that far. It costs too much to take a knife to it and tear it apart, this shouldn't be necessary.

Nice Processor

  Very fast processor that will run anything. Will work great for most average users with the stock heat sink, however, be forewarned it will get very hot. With the stock heat sink on Prime 95 version 26 it would easily get up to 95-99 C and throttle back. While gaming it would hover around high 70s C. Disabling HyperThreading and Turboboost would clock it back to 4.0 GHz instead of 4.4 GHz which helps temps if you don't have an after market cooler. Around 85 C on Prime 95 and high 60s C during gaming with these disabled.Installed a Noctua nh-u12s which drastically help keep better temps which I recommend doing. With this cooler installed I get around mid 70s C on Prime 95 and around mid 50s C during gaming with HT and Turboboost enabled.While the stock cooler will work fine in most instances even for gaming, I would recommend to purchase an aftermarket one if you plan on pushing the CPU for extended periods or any overclocking what so ever.

  Can't recommend the 4790K enough. Coming from a non-biased view, it's amazing. I've owned both high-end AMD CPUs, older gen Intel i7s, and AMD GPUs, so I'm not stuck to one company over another, but the 4790 is the best processor I've had the pleasure of owning. The performance is just amazing. If you do a lot of video editing and want the speed for processor intense activities like rendering, CAD, etc., the power is there. For gaming and CPU intensive games, it has the speed so you're not being throttled and limited like you were with older generations i7s like my old Clarksfield i7-840QM. If a game you're playing is only utilizing a single core, the 1.87 GHz speed of that older i7 really kills you, but these new 4th generation i7s have all you need and then some, even if running off a single core. I have noticed some in the gaming community saying go with the i5-4670k as it's still good in performance, but cheaper and thus lets you spend more elsewhere. However I wouldn't recommend the i5, as spending a bit more up-front to future proof your computer so you save more down the road is always the better option, and the price difference is negligible. When I purchased this CPU on sale, the price difference between what I bought this for and what the lower-end 4670K costs, is less than I would of spent for a tank of gas.As a side note, as this is a K model and unlocked, it's made for overclocking. If you overclock, these overclock very well, but do tend to run a little hot over their previous iterations, so having a good aftermarket heat sink is a must (or watercooling if that's your thing). However, even if you don't overclock, having this model helps to future-proof your PC by allowing you to squeeze added performance out of the processor, and get you that much more use from your computer before you have to shove out more money for new parts. So I'd definitely recommend the K version even if you don't have immediate plans on overclocking.

Great performance. High heat.
","

  This processor will run hotter than the older Core processors. You should also check your BIOS voltages, most OC websites recommend 1.2V for 4.4GHz to see about 6°C tem. drop without loss. This Processor will test 25°C bellow Maximum operating reported by Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool 64-bit, running at 86°C using Corsair Link to verify processor temperature. So I am assuming the maximum specified temperature, before forced shutdown, is at or about 110°C (I am a sensor error of +/-5°C). There are also articles Benchmarking the i7 4790K with all fans set to low and the processor runs at a constant 100°C with only none, or negligible loss. meaning, to burn this processor you would have to do something wrong, or it has to be defective in the first place. It was tested at factory, so defects should be minimal, only thing you have to worry about is shipping competency of the warehouse. Mine was shipped... OK, it works for now... though I can't get used to the high temperatures. I am using a H80i Corsair ... still seeing 80's on stress tests. Gaming, with good GPU, you won't see above 70's with stock cooler, with a 560 Ti I am seeing 77°C running Mass Effect 3, FireFall (72), Tom Clacy's Splinter Cell Black Ops(75°C)... it really depends on how efficiently they made their engines and how dependent they are on the processor, most FPS games are focused on using the monkey-house GPU rather than the brain-trust CPU.The only drawback is the heat. It will provide you with seamless performance across video compiling to HD gaming, and Autodesk/Solid Works project renderings. It can't be slowed down, let alone stopped. Just invest in cooling to improve product life. Lower temp = longer life. Please Do NOT try to build a system with this in the smaller cases, this is a high performance processor, not suited for internet browsing machines. This is not your casual PC user processor, though if you can spare the dough, why not? Also don't be thrifty on the motherboard, it will gimp your performance. I recommend at least 16GB of DDR3 1600 to complement the processing power.For the OC users, I don't see the need, but if you want to go nuts, be my guest. Just remember it runs hot with factory settings. It OC its self to 4.4GHz at about 1.36V.Used: 38 hours continuously, one interruption for 3 hours to install H80i liquid cooler, ran 12 more hours as of review post time.

  Stock cooler is absolutely terrible! I mean that too, A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y new word T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Running the stock setup I saw temps over 65c. With a Corsair h100i GTX I can overclock to a nice 4.7 and never see anything north of 50c (not that I left it overclocked - stock and this cooler is a steady 35c!)If you're a power user this is a great CPU, but even then a lot of video products like Handbrake can utilize a nice GPU in lieu of a nicer CPU. Between the heat issues and price difference over an i5 ($100) I'd make sure I needed the i7. Just something to think about if you're on the fence.

Used for content creation and also some gaming. Works great and clocked at 4.4
","

  Purchased for a new PC build for film editing and other content creation. Also gaming. It has handled everything that I've thrown at it, especially with a GTX 980 paired to it. I used the one-click overclock on my ASUS motherboard bios and got it to 4.4 and run it on a daily with no problems. I initially wanted a 6 or 8 core processor for film editing purposes but didn't want to end up spending too much more than what I already was. And I got this for $30 off. So far it has worked great. I'll still end up upgrading to a 6 or 8 core CPU at some point but this will do just fine in the mean time.

It is an I7 - You get what you pay for!
","

  Skylake might be new but does not mean it is worth upgrading. It is ok if you need a brand new computer but not for an upgrade.  Buying new ram, mobo and cpu is not worth that much money for the small increase in performance.The 4790k will be a hard cpu to beat for gaming. It already has the same thermal design as Skylake and can overclock to make up a loss in its age.My old I7 870 still works like a champ and has outlasted everything else in my old computer. The I7 is great cpu for someone that does not want to upgrade every time a new one comes out because of it's top tier features.Read reviews from actual testings websites and you will see why 4790k is one of the best LGA1150 cpu's for gaming.

  Product Itself: Worked great easy installation and everything worked flawlessly plug and play have purchased this over a year ago.Opinion:A regular 4790K will cost you roughly 320 EUR, say 339 USD. A binned 4.8 MHz model is in the 375 USD range and the 5 GHz models will pass 400 USD. As such a binned processor is more expensive, but does come with that very nice guaranteed clock frequency. Perhaps if you are in the market for a new system and would like to rule out that your processor is capable of a certain frequency, well that’s where these guys can come in very handy. Currently they are selling 4690K / 4790K and even 5960X processors that have been preselected and tested for you. Go check them out, our experiences with them has been nothing other than pleasant and the product does exactly as advertised.

It would run at 4.8GHz but I wasn't comfortable with the voltage I had to pump into it, so I backed it down slightly. I would definitely recommend this processor.

great processor. when using this processor
","

  great processor.when using this processor, i did have to go into the bios and disable the turbo boost to cap the cpu clock at 4.0 GHz to prevent a system overheat in the event of heavy cpu utilization.that useful note will hopefully prevent an overheat / shutdown for someone if they are running the cpu for simulation or mining.you can also consider using OCCT to monitor the temperatures when using the cpu to diagnose temperatures and clock frequencies.well worth it.

","

  Installing this thing was probably the most nerve racking thing about assembling my computer.  I connected this to an ASUS ROG Maximus VII Hero.  It runs beautifully.  My computer start up time is around 10-15 seconds and programs open up almost instantly.  I did not use the fan included with this.  I'm not sure I would recommend doing that ESPECIALLY if you're overclocking.  I have mine running on a water cooled system with two dedicated fans.  Actually I have been using this for about 8 months now and still love it.  I'm not an expert.  In fact, this was my first build and it was an awesome experience.  This little guy is kind of costly but if you're looking for a little future proofing, this might be a good way to go.  RAM can be upgraded later as it advances.

  It's powerful, there's no doubting that, but overclockability is not the best, temps are a bit high under load (even with a Corsair h100i and unrestricted airflow). Might just be this particular batch though, but it's still enough to handle pretty much everything at stock speeds. Packaging is top notch, and pretty quick, considering it's from US to Hong Kong, taking roughly a week and a bit. Would recommend any day of the week.

  Works as advertised, what can I say.  Intel delivers.  I've overclocked it form 4 GH to 4.75 Ghz and it's perfectly stable. No problems at all.  The 4ht genration Haswell chip was worth waiting for and I am very pleased.  I am running a CoolerMaster cpu cooler, and could have probably gotten by with the standard intel cooler, even when overclocking.  Price and performance were right in the sweet spot in my opinion.

  The 4790k is a beast. This processor is must-buy. However, be sure to purchase an after-market heat-sink. The stock heat-sink (for me atleast) was unusable. Under full load at 4GHz, the temperatures increased above 90C within 20 seconds with the sock heat-sink. I may have mounted it poorly though.

Do Not Buy. First came DOA, Second DEAD within a year. Extremely Dissapointed
","

  I am bummed to write this review. I bought this to upgrade my PC to have what I thought was the 'BEST' CPU I could. The first processor I received showed up DOA (Dead on arrival). I tried installing it, the computer wouldn't display, had my local computer shop try, and they couldn't get it to work either. So I came back to Amazon they had the replacement shipped out that day! Amazing as usual from Amazon. Got the replacement had the computer shop install it no problem. Now I've had the processor about a year with what I would consider light use, minimal gaming, surfing the web, edited a few videos. And now the CPU is operating at about 17% of what it should be. The computer still works and runs but is sluggish and slow for being a top spec computer. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I buy a $300+ CPU thinking it would be amazing and it was while it worked. Due to the nature of building a PC and what not I am basically out $300+. I do not recommend this processor; I know Intel is the best but go with a different model.

3 stars for an intel chip?
","

  If you've ever heard of delidding, you'll know why I gave this 3 stars.  If not, you nervewrackingly have to break open your $300 chip and replace the thermal paste to get acceptable overclocking temperatures with air cooling.  This is because intel uses cheap, cruddy thermal paste between the die and heatsink.  Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent chip, but for top of the line its not acceptable to use bird poop as thermal paste.  Replacing the paste with coollaboratory liquid ultra dropped my temps over 10 celcius.

  I was surprised that it had a small fan for a core i7 processor but i've been using it for some weeks now and it looks like everything's  working ok, also it came with thermal paste on the cpu which is a plus. I currently run Need For Speed Hot Pursuit on it with all settings high and I'm using only my on board graphics card and it plays beautifully no lag no stuttering with game play whatsoever,... It doesn't feel like it's living up to it's name though when i run Flight Simulator X, (if you don't now about Flight Simulator X it's a flight simulator, but it's a really good game that can test your pc limits),... Some areas of the world with a lot of scenery still has low fps but keep in mind i still don't have a graphics card besides the on board one, so maybe that's why! I'm not very technical about computers but in a nutshell I believe it deserves 4 stars because it is far better than anything i've ever had but not as good as i thought it would be! For $300 USD

  I built my previous computer more than 6 years ago, and was due a refresh. So, naturally, I wanted the best bang-for-the-buck processor in my new build. Enter the i7-4790K. Four cores, eight threads, and a base clock speed of 4 GHz make this processor a best buy, IMO. They redesigned the thermal layer in this CPU, so the temperatures remain incredibly manageable while overclocking it. That being said, this processor is so fast that I haven't even bothered OC'ing it, and my setup is more than capable of doing so - it's paired with an ASRock Z97 motherboard, fast RAM, etc.This processor is a no-brainer for anyone looking to upgrade, and if you pair this with a solid state drive, it'll blow your mind how fast everything becomes.

Stock heat-sink is really loud
","

  Normally, I'd give a product like this either 5 stars or 1 star.  Basically, you'd think it either works or it doesn't.  I'm giving this 4 stars because the chip, which is the primary thing you're buying, is great.  However, the fan/heat-sink provided is terrible.  It works, but is also incredibly loud.  It sounds like you have a kettle on the stove at all times.If you're looking for a fast chip, I highly recommend this processor, but you should purchase an aftermarket heat-sink to go with it.

  I was very happy when I received the Boxed 4790K CPU. The batch no. is L352C120. I searched in google and found that L352C120 is not so good in overclocking compare to L4 batch no. However, I tested this CPU in my ASUS Maximus VI. The default VID for 4.4Ghz is only around 1.185V. I overclocked it finally to 4.6Ghz @ 1.21V with memory running 2200Mhz (9-9-10-24-1T) stable with Prime95 for 10minutes. The full load temperature is around 85 C with Antec 920 closed-loop watercooling. I am quite satisfy with this CPU. I think I can lower the loading temperature more if a more powerful cooler is installed. Overall, I am quite satisfy with Amazon service. Thanks !!!

  Here's my build to add context to the review:CPU: i7-4790KCooler: Corsair H100i (with Noctua fans)Mobo: Asus Maximus VI Gene (mATX)RAM: 8GB G.Skill Ripjaws X (2133MHz)SSD: Intel 730 Series 240GBHDD: Two (2) 3TB Seagate Barracudas in RAID1PSU: Corsair CS550M (80+ gold)Video Card: GTX 750Ti EVGA Superclocked edition(all other parts are irrelevant)My experience with this chip has been nothing but fantastic from the beginning. I have been stress testing my chip for a few days at varying frequencies, and my results were almost unbelievable. I was able to achieve 5.1GHz with my voltage set on auto. I used both P95 and AIDA64 in my testing, both of which my CPU passed with flying colors after a 4 hour ""burn in."" However, I was not able to make it to 5.2GHz since my PC blue screened after 5 minutes of Prime95.All of this is extremely surprising since I've seen numerous reviews raving that this chip is a bad overclocker. So I've narrowed my possibilities down to three reasons. One, The reviewers who had overheating issues had a bad cooling system; two, they're very bad at using the BIOS; three, I must have the most golden 4790K to hit the shelves. Whichever is the case, I feel I have a great CPU and one that overclocks like a boss. If you don't believe me, I have the CPUID screenshot on my desktop for bragging rights.If you're looking for a great Haswell refresh chip, look no further. This is a phenomenal processor. Or maybe I'm just excited to be upgrading from an AMD Phenom build that I've had since 2008.

Fantastic CPU

  I recently purchased this CPU because I was having some video issues on my AMD FX-8350 build. I would get this micro stutter when panning left or right in any of the latest release games or games that require a mid to high range video card to run (Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Far Cry 3, Metro 2033 etc.) I know my video could handle it as I have a EVGA GTX 780 Ti Super Clocked and I know that beast eats all the latest graphics like they aren't even there so I was a bit concerned why I was getting this stutter. I changed out so many parts it was ridiculous. I finally had enough and changed to this CPU (I used the EVGA Z97 FTW board) and right away that stutter just left as soon as it arrived. Now I'm not saying that AMD is bad by any means, look what's in the next gen consoles, but I sure was tired of fighting with the issue I had and Intel delivered the performance I was hoping for. This was my first Intel build and I have to say I'm a huge fan now. I know its a bit more expensive but it certainly was worth the extra money for it. My EVGA board didn't even need a BIOS update to use this CPU either so I'll be sure to write a good review on that board as its awesome and works just like it should.

  A wonderful processor. It's lightning fast, has a bit of overclocking headroom (not like you'd need to with the speeds it offers out of the box!). The cooler that comes with it is garbage, but that's to be expected. it runs very cool, and is well worth the money. However, if you believe Intel's claims of getting it to 5GHz on air, shed those hopes immediately. It becomes way too power hungry and way too hot before you can get there. It might be possible for that one person who gets lucky and gets the perfect product, but for normal use, you won't get that. All in all though, a very good buy, and I'd highly recommend it.

  The 4790k fixes everything wrong with 4770k for the same price as it's predecessor. You will experience no slowdowns and your computer will fly through literally anything you throw at it. while overclocked, this CPU can beat out intel's lower-end 6 core, socket 2011, Enthusiast CPU's at stock. This processor is also just fun to play with, being a great overclocker due to it's redesigned power management and redisigned TIM. If you have a 4770k, it might not be enough to jump the gun, but if you're looking for an upgrade, this is the one.Edit: Due to the Meltdown fix, CPU speed and I/O speeds have been reduced, (the latter far more than the former). Still, this is not acceptable, and as such I have knocked a star of the review.

Pentium G3258 +  utilities + no advantages in gaming
","

  Unless you will be rendering videos very actively, the ""i7"" name is there just so you feel good about yourself, for 5 times the price of a Pentium G3258. I have achieved exactly the same FPS in games like Crysis, Dota, LoL, Skyrim, Borderlands 2, the Forest with an EVGA GTX 970 FTW edition. G3258 does not bottleneck games or cause stuttering as long as you stick around the 1440p and below. I have received the same scores for Unigine Heaven benchmark at ultra settings 1080p too.Also it gets very hot for even with the best air cooling. So now you have to add even more money to throw in a solid liquid cooling solution, which will be about twice as much as a G3258 itself.I spoke of this CPU negatively, but the specific CPU I've had run up to 5.0 ghz stably, just too hot. So this thing is still a beast. Fortunately, the extra performance is useless for anyone who wants to game. Please do yourself a favor and get an okay air fan and a Pentium G3258. Not even an i5 is worth it unless you certainly have to play the very few games that are out there that just require at least quad cores.If you need to upgrade in a year or two, you only have to give up a 50-60 dollar piece, because g3258 is that cheap.

  This CPU is LGA1150 (mistakenly purchased this thinking most Intel boards matched up with Intel products, my bad) and over a year since I last rebuilt a computer.  My Maximus VIII Hero board is an LGA1151 socket, so this misses the mark by slim margin as the small pins are slightly higher than the CPU chip. so this 1150 will not fit.  This CPU is less than $400, yet the 1151 - I7 processor is scarce and, on Amazon priced at over $500 when MSRP is $350!

The right CPU for me
","

  I fought with myself for months over weather I wanted this CPU or the i7-6700k, and I think I made the right choice. That said, there are some drawbacks, and it may not be right for you.I previously had a Core 2 Quad Q6600 on a Gigabyte P43 DDR3 board, with 16GB of DDR3 2133 that I'd recently purchased and a Radeon 7870 GHz Edition. Believe it or not, I was still doing some gaming on that system, but I was having problems with it locking up and crashing (that turned out to be my video card, but I won't go into that). I was also frustrated by the SATA2 ports slowing down my SSD, and the PCIe 1.0 x1 slots slowing down my USB3 card, so I decided it was long past time for an upgrade.I'm fairly thrifty, so I compared reviews, watched for deals, and did a ton of research. If I stuck with Haswell, I could reuse my existing DDR3 no problem, but Skylake DDR3 boards, especially ones that support normal DDR3, not low voltage, are much harder to come by. On the other hand, Skylake and the 100-series chipset have much more available PCIe bandwidth, for things like m.2 SSDs, USB3.1 controllers, and whatever else you want to put in a PCIe slot, aside from the i7-6700k being slightly faster in some situations than this CPU. You will find a lot of Socket 1150 boards that have USB 3.1 and m.2 slots onboard, but they do it by using the same PCIe bandwidth as the PCIe slots, so plugging in a PCIe card into the slot that e.g. the m.2 slot is using will either slow down or completely disable the m.2 slot. If you're seriously looking at an m.2 SSD and a PCIe sound card, wireless card, or TV tuner, than you probably want to go with Skylake.Last November I came across a deal I couldn't pass up, this CPU with an Asus Z97-A/USB3.1, for about $100 less than I could have bought a similar Skylake system, not including the cost of DDR4 memory. I'm no video editor, I use a USB gaming headset, my SATA SSD is fast enough, and I still don't own anything USB 3.1, so I decided that the PCIe issue wasn't worth the extra cost.I won't bother including any benchmarks, there are dozens of sites out there with benchmarks far more detailed than anything I could fit into this review. For my use, which is mostly web browsing with some gaming (Assassin's Creed, Borderlands TPS, Project Cars, and a few others going at the moment), this CPU has been amazing. I'm hoping that even 5 years down the road I'll still be able to play the latest and greatest titles.

Devil's Canyon BEAST

  I built my gaming PC earlier this year and decided to go for the 4790K over the 4690K for the higher clock speed and 4 extra threads. Both of those matter to me as I'm frequently gaming, listening to music, browsing, etc concurrently. Those extra threads and GHZ really do make a difference in a multitasking machine; especially one used for video editing or other content creation.For me, cost was not an issue. It was only $100 more than the 4690k, and for a system I expect to last me the next 6+ years, it amounts to pennies.Paired with a noctua NH-U14S, I was able to hit a 4.7 GHZ overclock on all cores at 1.248 volts. I could probably tweak this a bit, but since it's been rock solid I don't see the need to push it further. Temps have been fine as well, reaching 82* celsius on the hottest core during prime 95 26.6 after 4 hours of running it and barely breaking 50* celsius when gaming or doing anything else.There's really nothing to complain about with this processor.Though it's on its way out with the 6700K now released, if you got a 4790K within the past year there's no need for buyer's remorse. Their performance is extremely similar, so there's not a whole lot 4790K owners are missing out on.If I were building a new pc today, of course I'd go for the 6700K over the 4790K, but feel absolutely no regrets or that I'm missing out with the 4790K.System Specs:CPU: Intel Core i7-4790K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor OC to 4.7GHZ@1.248vCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-U14S CPU CoolerMotherboard: MSI Z97 MPOWER MAX AC ATX LGA1150 MotherboardMemory: Crucial Ballistix Tactical 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR3-1600 MemorySSD: Samsung 850 Pro Series 512GB 2.5"" Solid State DriveSSD: Samsung 850 Pro Series 512GB 2.5"" Solid State DriveHDD: Western Digital Red Pro 4TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard DriveHDD: Western Digital Red Pro 4TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard DriveVideo Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 980 4GB FTW ACX 2.0 Video CardCase: Fractal Design Define R5 (Black) ATX Mid Tower CasePower Supply: EVGA 850W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power SupplyOperating System: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-bitCase Fans: 4x Noctua NF-A14 industrialPPC-2000 PWM 140mm FanMouse: ROCCAT Kone Pure Naval Storm Wired Optical MouseKeyboard: Max Keyboard Blackbird Tenkeyless (TKL) Cherry MX Backlit Mechanical Keyboard with Brown Switches

  This chip is unreal, its fast, doesn't overheat, and yes can be overclocked via/CMOS/BIOS. 4.0ghz is more then enough power for me, I run FSX & FSX-SE all with an average of between 120fps to 198fps. The reason why is simple, spend the money on this chip ONLY if your going to get a Monster Video card coupled with it. You'd be defeating your purpose any other way. I have had this chip as high as 4.8ghz, only to test it. It didn't fail for one second. Sadly, I had to buy this Chip at another Vending company, its WAY over priced here by about $102.00 bucks, and now I'm sure is even cheaper elsewhere. If your looking for speed for gaming with a good graphics card, this is the one.

  Literally bought this in December 2014 for a workstation PC build and even by the end of 2019 it still consistently outperforms the new hardware at anything 4 cores and lower. Warning, you basically need water cooling to reach the performance specifications of this processor or it will start ramping down the clock as the temp increases. Not surprising at all to see the price increasing year over year. This is one of the greatest processors produced and I would not be surprised if it's floating point arithmetic speed still outperforms even the most expensive contemporary processors.

Worthwhile upgrade for anyone with LGA1150 boards, or DDR3 memory
","

  Other reviewers have posted benchmarks and reviews, and most are aware that it performs close to the newer i7-6700k. Having owned a i7-3770S, i7-5820k, FX-8320E, A10-7850k and many others, I'd have to say the most important part of any CPU is its processing power (most importantly) and features or features of the chipset (ie SATA3 vs. SATA2, PCI 3.0 vs. 2.0, M.2, etc.). Do the i7-6700k's offer enough new features to choose them over the i7-4790k? Maybe if you're starting from scratch. The i7-6700k's do support DDR3 low voltage, and if you find a motherboard your old RAM may work with the chip. But high voltage RAM (assuming you're not using DDR3L) can strain the memory controller, and potentially void the warranty.  Anyone with an LGA1150 board or a considerable amount a spare DDR3 memory, looking to build a high end system should give this processor a glance.

  Upgraded from a 1st gen i7 920 to this. Based on benchmarks, the 4790k is at least twice as ""fast"" as the 920, sometimes even more (depends on the benchmark). I can't say it ""feels"" twice as fast but I could bump up the graphics for some games and they run smoother than they used to even with the graphics all set to 'high' so obviously there is an improvement. Note that this is LGA1150 and the new generation i7/i5 are using LGA1151 which means that the 1151 is sort of a dead end but I don't know if this is a factor for most people when buying a CPU.Also, I found this at a local store for around 25% less then the Amazon price.

  Solid. I trade for a living. One needs a CPU which is strong enough to keep up with an influx of tremendous volume at any given moment. In addition, with many charts open across 3 monitors, one being a 4k monitor, my old AMD A10-5800k overclocked to 4.5ghz just couldn't keep up, even after adding a GTX 970 to it. My old processor would lag whenever quickly scrolling through chart data, and could even freeze when a particular news event hits, especially if I have many charts open. This was not acceptable. I am moving from amateur to professional in my work, and I couldn't do that without a proper computer.Welcome to Devil's Canyon, where no amount of charts is too many and no amount of order volume too much. It seems like nothing can bog this thing down. This is the weapon I take to work everyday. It barely breaks a sweat. It is being cooled with an H100i GTX Corsair liquid cooling system, and that keeps this processor at a brisk 29-30 degrees C. I have turned off speed step which is the setting that allows the processor clock to fluctuate based on need [to save power etc.]. In the market anything can happen at any time, and I do not want to add any more lag  than is already built in by virtue of my distance from the exchanges. Speedstep works seamlessly, however I like knowing my computer is breathing at a steady pace.If you're a profesional and you require computing power without completely breaking the bank, this here will do the job well. I also have one monitor dedicated to recording the trading session (I utilize Open Broadcasting Software... highly recommended open source software for screen capturing), and this takes up a meagre 3% of CPU use. On the AMD heavy trading volume + screen capturing was guaranteed disaster. This processor slices through this like a laser cut knife through a banana. No effort required. I do not care for speed as much as I care about the ability to handle anything thrown at it instantaneously without getting bogged down... the 4790k impresses me in that regard.

Best bang for buck

  DDR4 ram is too expensive right now and a luxury and doesn't really help with hardcore PC gaming. That and some other things were the only reasons to switch to the Intel 2011v3. Since GTX980 just came out, it will still be quite a long while before Nvidia puts out a sub-28nm card that is capable of taking advantage of the new z99 etc chipset of shared architectures. Doesn't make sense to SLI the 980 since true 4k games are still a ways away and still waiting for Windows 10 to fix the display scaling issues. In a nutshell, no reason to move from the 1150 for the foreseeable future. That leaves Devil's Canyon as the king of the crown.Although this processor cannot really get overclocked (it is basically a 4770k that is OC'd from the factory) it is indeed stable at 4.0Ghz, but you'd have to get an aftermarket cooler cause the stock fan will leave the CPU hot enough to fry an egg at idle.But other than that, the 4790k is definitely the sweet spot of gaming PC processors and the most bang for buck in the top tier that one can get for gaming. This is good enough, and will probably continue to remain a valid strong contender even when DirectX12 comes out and and GPU's catch up to the CPU. Doesn't make sense to get or to wait for an Intel Octo-core since there are no Octos coming out in the next few years that will have stock of more than 4.0Ghz, and lets face it for majority of applications and almost all of gaming, octo is a nonstarter as adding more cores doesn't scale as well as Intel would like people to believe. There are fundamental issues in computer science that prevent us from scaling with more and more cores so basically speaking more than 8 cores and you past the point of diminishing returns. Some games like FSX, Arma III, etc are heavily single processor Ghz dependent and that is where the 4790k really shines and will outshine anything on the next gen octo's for a long long time. And besides for most gaming and applications 16GB is more than sufficient, 32GB is future proof in the future and a big waste right now, and 64GB is a joke.So yeah Devil's Canyon will be good for the next five years. Like I said, Best bang for buck

  This beast of a CPU is a must have for system builders looking for one of the best productivity values out there. However, stess testing this CPU can make it heat up like crazy. I did some digging around and found a lot of other people are having the same trouble. The best solution I've found is to use Intel Extreme Tuning utility to limit the max turbo boost power at 88W, Turbo boost short power max at 110W, Turbo boost power time window at 8 seconds, and the Processor current limit to 105 A. With this tweak i was able to keep the max temperature at 67C on the hottest core over a 30 min prime 95 torture test using a Corsair H100i cooler.

  Upgraded from a Haswell i5 4570 (3.2GHz base clock). I paired it with a $90 (read: budget) MSI Z97 PC Mate motherboard, 1TB Samsung Evo 850 SSD and an Cooler Master Evo 212 CPU fan. CRAZY FAST.Stock fan is horribly load at load and temps will get high. So do yourself a favor and grab an aftermarket CPU cooler to go with ANY CPU, overclocked or not. I had this 212 on my old i5 and decided to take it with me to my new i7. I'm overclocked to the turbo frequency 24/7 at 4.4GHz. Temps while browsing, downloading, etc are roughly ~38-40C.I chose this over the non ""k"" i7 version because the base and turbo clocks were higher for not all that much more money.

  I ordered this for a new computer build.  So far (just over a month) it has been perfect.  Easily overclocked to 4.7Ghz, but I normally only run it at stock speed.  It does seem to run a little hotter than I expected.  I run this system pretty hard with video and sound editing, and have never seen it peak out for more than a second or two at a time.  It far exceeded my expectations.  I performed a video conversion using Media Converter 8, and with my previous system (Pentium D 3.6Ghz) it took just about twelve minutes to convert a 21 minute video clip.  This system with the 4790k performed the same exact conversion in just over 2 minutes.  Plus, I am able to run virtual machines in VMware Workstation with absolutely no delay or lag of any kind.  I couldn't be happier!

  After saving up some money I wanted to build myself a system that will still game 5 years down the road. Even though Skylake processors and the Z170 chipset just came out, I chose Z97. I was able to buy this processor for about $30 less than a 6700k, and match it with a Z97 motherboard for only $55. Personally, the performance difference was not worth the difference in cost.This i7 is still overkill for anything I'm playing now, but after it's aged a bit, the processor will still handle 1080p/1440p gaming. A 1070 is a good match for this CPU; that graphics card will still be capable of running new games in 5 years (probably not on the highest settings). I intend to drive the 4790k into the ground until its processing power is simply not adequate. Will update this review in 5 or so years.Don't believe me about this running new games 5 years from now? Go to YouTube and lookup Doom on GTX 470 and a Phenom II 965 BE. It runs, it's playable and it doesn't even look bad. That is a 2010 Fermi GPU running a graphically intensive 2016 game. The 965 BE holds its own as well, being a quad-core CPU less capable than an i5 4590, or even an i3 6100.

Bad overclocking ability
","

  Performance is enough for most gaming, but overclocking this piece is a pain. The default frequency is high enough, so it is hard to push the clock higher, but the major issue is the TEMPERATURE. Cores can get EXTREMELY HOT under load if you overclock and add core voltage. I probably have got a bad piece, which requires a voltage of 1.23v at 4.6GHz. This was the stablest voltage for my 4790K, I have tried to reduce the voltage and it caused blue screens even when gaming. However, under AIDA64 stability test the average core temperature is about 95℃, which prevented further overclocking (i tried push the frequency to 4.7GHz at higher voltage, but the core was overheat when doing the stability test, then the frequency dropped. Pleace note that I am using a 240mm cooler master liquid cooler with all the fans running at max speed). The difference of performance between 4.4GHz and 4,7GHz is barely noticeable even at benchmark test. I am now buying a Haswell-E processor, with larger surface area and soldered IHS, its cooling performance are much better than the 4790K, and there will be a huge gain in performance if you overclock it to above 4GHz. Maybe several years later i will have it delidded and build a custom-loop water cooling for it, see if I can push the frequency higher.

I mean, I kicked the habit, but like a junkie I started reading the articles and I see the higher base clock and smoother power delivery, improved thermal interface material and lower temps and in a dream state, I placed an order. Through the gauzy haze of the evening sky, one dusty footstep succeeding the next, I entered,...The Devil's Canyon. Did your lights just flicker too?Next thing I know I have packages arriving and out pops a

16 GB of Kingston 2400 Mhz RAM

  , a 

Hyper 212 EVO

   along with a 

SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD

   among all the rest of it. It may be time to remove that credit card information, so I have to enter it to make a purchase.I spent $1050 using a 

Cooler Master N200 case

   and an 

Antec High Current 620W

  , case fan and wireless along with what I mentioned earlier, which altogether might be $50 cheaper today, you know how that goes. I already had the video card and I'm skipping the optical drive, I'll go external for storage, not wanting the extra heat.I was overclocking back when we used aquarium pumps and chests full of ice water for cooling our CPU's, strange days, but I haven't been for about a decade, so call me an old newb (on second thought, don't ever call anybody that), but I've tried to catch up with LOTS of research.I wanted to be reasonable and still end up with something that would humiliate the 3.4/up to 3.9 GHz 4770 plus SSD I'm using with a GTX 660 Ti. That upgrade did little to impress me over Sandy bridge, in all this recent research that I've done, I found out that the 4770 and 4770K only run 3.7 GHz on all four cores according to Intel. But the 4790K's turbo runs two cores at 4.4 GHz, four cores at 4.2 GHz and all four can be clocked 4.4 or higher, like the four barrel and four speed in a Olds 442. Face it guys, if we could drive our computers to the local drive in, park and open the hood like it was the 1960's, we would.Enough silly nostalgic similes, I want to tell you what happened!I received a recent creation being batch # L419B650 or Malay/2014/week 19/B650. Using it the first day I left it stock and it was weird to be shutting down my computer, but I believe a proper break in requires allowing it to cool and run at operating temperature. Then I did the full burn in and all my heatsinks are sunk. Speaking of heatsinks, this does come with one, that's not designed for overclocking.I first used just the auto overclock and it was stable at 4.5 GHz, I didn't expect the top overclock using a mid priced micro and air. I would of used water cooling if needed, but if the temps are better with this chip and they seem to be, then maybe it's not, it is one of it's selling points after all. After just a little adjusting I'm seeing 4.7 GHz on all 4 cores, a 44x cache with improved RAM timings and I feel like I got a free NOS kit. That's 500 MHz over stock and a 21% faster clock speed than a 4770 and add in the faster RAM and faster SSD and...BAM, I've kicked it up a notch. Remember that on four cores you're starting at 4.2, not 4.4 GHz. It will run Sandra's burn in over and over and Intel's ETU stress test, so I feel it's stable.That Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is really something, you can start playing after dinner and the next thing you know, you smell breakfast cooking. You will want to save your profile in the BIOS anyway, but it shows default and your changes highlighted in an easy to see way.I think I might hit 4.8 with some more time, but maybe not, trying is the fun part after all and I've only restarted it 60 or 70 times. The temps are okay at 80 degrees max and I haven't tried anything to lower them yet so I can up the voltage beyond 1.26, my room is a cool 70.5 degrees F. I've found that just re-installing the heatsink a few times might lower them 5 degrees, because the best install is rarely the first try. Maybe I'll try a second fan on that big ol' rad he ate her. The rated max temp on this chip is 72.72 degrees but I'll never stress it for long and the Tjunction temp is 100 degrees, at which point it will throttle down to protect itself. It idles at 29 degrees.I almost went with a 4930K/2011 setup but with the price difference I'm glad that I didn't, this processor is the heart of a relatively inexpensive, high end, everyday desktop/gaming machine. With the M.2 ports theoretical speed of 1.8 GB/s on the Z97 boards, we may soon see much faster, inexpensive SSD's at 800+ MB/s and that will be another kick in the pants for this system, but as of today Samsung's XP941 needs competition to lower the pricing and the market needs time to mature. The Extreme Pro is a very fast SATA SSD though, Extremely. Edit: I couldn't wait for M.2 to catch up and have purchased a second SanDisk to run RAID 0 for now and fast, just keeps on getting faster.So far, this chip's a winner and thorough annihilation of the pitiful 4770 4-cylinder,..ah,..core,..has surely been accomplished by this old hot rodder/modder. After reading 20 or more tech site articles (some with multiple chips) they show 4.6 to 4.8 as being the most common clock speeds achieved, with one reaching 4.85 and one 4.9 (as of today) and the individual chip being the most likely factor for it. I've read in forums that about 1 in 5 are reaching 5 GHz, but I haven't seen this at the sites where the overclock is registered for competition.Good luck and remember, every time that you want to scream in frustration,....This is FUN!Fast chip and recommended.2. This Kingston RAM is doing well, allowing very aggressive timings at 2400 MHz or a 200 MHz overclock. I tried a second cooler fan and have lowered the temps, so I went for 4.8 and reached it, booting and running benchmarks. But the temps were too high and it appears the CPU is throttling back, thus achieving little to no overall gain using the ITU benchmarking, so I didn't bother testing for stability.Sadly, for me it appears that about 4.7 on air is my max, if,.....or is it when? I switch to water, I'll let you know my progress.3. I think that I've squeezed this as best as I can while still on air, I had to think a little outside the box so I thought you might want to know. Maybe I can save you a case of energy drinks, maybe not.To sum it up, I used the CPU input voltage, SA, I/O and limits, core and cache voltages, plus the base clock in different combinations all weighed against temps. Sounds easy writing it, so why the bleep did it take me another 20 hours? It appears that it's common on Z97 boards to be using higher voltage settings than in the past from what I've read and mine are pretty high for air.My goal was applying maximum base clock and a 45x cache, up from 44x.What I did was set the memory stock and after finding the lowest voltage it took to reach the highest core multiplier I made a profile and then turned the multiplier down and did the same for the cache. Using the settings and knowledge I acquired from those two profiles I then combined them and started bumping up the base clock trying a little extra voltage here and there. Some only raised the temps and others will allow you to raise the clock speed too. For very useful OC'ing guides, do a search for Workshop: How to overclock and NickN Haswell.To reach 4.755 GHz stable the multiplier is at 47 on all 4 cores. The base clock is at 101.17 and 4047 GHz, this forced me to use stock memory timings and so I brought the RAM up to 2600 MHz, now at 2630 MHz. The cache multiplier is at 45x and an actual 4.553. The core is at 1.33v and the max temp is still okay and I'm not seeing any throttling. This last bit doesn't sound like a lot, but bumping the base clock, which overclocks everything and reaching the 45x cache, together made a difference.Using the squeegee vs small pea method my third cooler install was the best, verified by the fourth, lowering max temps by six degrees before adding the second fan. Don't underestimate your cooling, it will most likely determine your clock speed. By adjusting my rear exhaust and the coolers pull-fan to run 1600 RPM's at idle and 2000 at 60 degrees made a difference because it takes a bit before the fans spin up. Ambient temperature will also be factored in and if my room was 80 degrees F, I don't know if I would have ever reached this speed.This is providing the best benchmarks and the computer is acting normal in every way, finally put under the desk, software loaded and with external drives connected. Out of curiosity I ran the Passmark test and it scored 13211 or the #5 4790K position (as of today), showing a 14.6% increase over stock and 13.3% higher than the 4770K's average overclock and a whopping 24.8% over my 4770. This overclock is about the same difference as turning a 3.1 GHz i5 4440 into a 3.4 GHz i7 4770 and nearly the identical score as a stock clock 4930K 6 core at $240 more.Of the 357 4790K's listed, 2 are over 4.8 GHz and one of them is near stock rated (someone's tricky), so it's not on 4 cores. I keep coming back to this because of the early headlines claiming 5 GHz on air and this is not proving to be true, although there are many 5+ GHz overclocks out there.4. I'll keep it short,...I made it. Perseverance + faster fans on the cooler = more voltage = 48x/46x multipliers = a 4 hour stress test = 13,381 @ Passmark and 144.9 GOPS processor arithmetic @ Sandra (#14) = 15 days of sleep deprivation. I know, I should've/could've just started with water cooling,...But,...why did man climb the highest mountain?If you're wondering about the new fans on the 212, I needed a thin fan for RAM clearance to push and used a 

Scythe Slip Stream

   and to pull a 

NZXT FX

  .I'm not bragging here, you can do this too!,...or just buy one with any good aftermarket cooler and I think you'll see at least 4.5 GHz on 4 cores with almost no effort. Maybe even 4.6 GHz by just running auto-overclock, setting new multipliers and then passing the AIDA64 stability test and Sandra'a burn in,...and who knows what you'll get? At least you're guaranteed 4.2 compared to 3.7, like the 4770K on 4 cores. (intelDOTcom/support/processors/corei7/sb/CS-032279.htm?wapkw=4790k+turbo+boost) Just replace the DOT.Really though, if even this old man can get it up,....the clock speed I mean, you youngsters, with your staying power,....You know what I'm trying to say.Me? I'm considering Lab 501's idea of beer cooling, that way, by the time all the coolant's been,...ahem,...evaporated, I'll know the party's over,...and I'll be able to tell my kid he can't use it until he's 21.I need to make it plain to the inexperienced that this fool made it to 4.7 GHz in one evening and the gains I've made since are minor in comparison. So don't be put off by all the time I spent, I wanted to do this (like a terrier on a silicon rat...grrrrrr).For those that have read that cache speed doesn't matter, if you make your way to Sandra's 4790K processor arithmetic standings, you'll see my best at 48x/44x is 143.6,...48x/45x is 144.6 and 144.9 GOPS at 48x/46x. The number one is 47x/47x,...Mine's no longer #14, but the point is that it does seem to make a difference even if it's a small one.(www.sisoftwareDOTeu/rank2011d/show_device.php?q=c9a598d1bfcbaec2e2a1cebcd9f990a78abe89b080cbed8ab787a1d3eedef891ac9dbbd3eedbfd85b889afcaaf92a284f7cafa&l=en).Useful free downloads: SiSoft Sandra, Intel Tuning Utility, AIDA64, Real Temp, CPUID HW Monitor and there are many more to choose from, but understand that ITU will only get you to a point and then it's all BIOS. If you're lacking experience like I was, you should probably just start with the How to overclock article and AIDA64 to learn your BIOS basics and keep it simple at first. Your blue screens will help you if you search for the meaning of the code it displays, they won't tell you, but they will point you to RAM or CPU and finicky video may mean the PCIe bus and these all have their own adjustments.Remember to save your downloads to another disk so re-installing the OS will go quicker, which I've done several times now. I also use Macrium Reflect to create an image file after install, update and OS tuning to restore back to that point. Yes, you can use Windows restore too, but installing and updating Win 7 has been a final stability test that I haven't passed, when I'd assumed I would and I'm not interested in a mostly stable computer.Screen shots are also very useful, between BIOS changes, 4 benchmarks and reading internet info I felt like a old timer and having reference of the last scores and temps was much better than trying to remember all of it.Some reviews here say that this runs hot. Every chip is unique but that is not the norm, I don't know that my chip is either, but @ 100% load for hours @ 4.8 GHz RealTemp reports between 74 and 83 degrees from each core or 83 max, others concur. Leaving RealTemp running for days while doing video editing and rendering it reports 78 degrees max. 85 degrees is generally considered safe but if it goes above 73 completely stock, contact Intel because it's out of specs and don't mention overclocking.Whether you plan to overclock or not, this chip responds to RAM speed and if I were to do it over, I would spend more for even faster RAM. Do your research on this, because it's a combination of timings and MHz. Here on amazon the 

Patriot Viper CL 10 2400

   was tested at Anandtech to run CL 10 at 2666 MHz and isn't much higher priced than what I'm using, I paid $180 for CL 11 at 2400 that I clocked to 2600 MHz. But let me be clear that core speed will be 90+ percent of performance for most and that I have used CL 9 1600 MHz in this computer to verify what RAM speed can do. My point is that if you wish it would clock faster, but it won't, 3% from faster RAM and using a faster drive is where your performance will come from instead and you need to consider this before purchasing all your components.Edit: I've tested the Patriot kit and I'll tell you what I found in that review.If I may be so bold as to offer advice on testing for stability, I'd say to find a short test that will blue screen your computer, so you don't have to run long tests to find out first. For me, Sandra's cache bandwidth test was likely to blue screen mine and it only took 2 minutes to run. If I passed that, then it was worth running the longer tests.To you guys who say this chip is fast enough at stock speeds, you're not wrong but,...except for the two fans I didn't pay anything for 15% higher performance, as a matter of fact, including the newer GTX 960, at about $1300 this is a pretty fast computer.I write reviews for online shoppers, if I didn't cover your question, I'll try to help.

  No complaints other than me not doing my proper research and buying something I didn't quite need, could've settled for a good i5 for my gaming rig but I ""needed the best"". This thing rocks but if I was going for an i7 again I would go for this version here: http://amzn.to/1f2kkg2Pros:Insane power and speed, great overclockability, does not run too hot if properly cooled (im using hyper 212 evo which can be found here: http://amzn.to/1B1JJAA after ditching a AIO watercooler), does not bottleneck anything except on some particular GPU benchmarks like valley, this thing does not blink for any game... everCons:I did not need this much processor. IF Building a non 4k GAMING RIG probably just get a i5 4690k here: http://amzn.to/1MnH58uI wish I had and used the cash for upgrading GPU.

Best Value CPU @ the Moment!
","

  This is my 1st Intel CPU since the Pentium days. I have purchased AMD since. I had a AMD Phenom X4 975 (Deneb) That I o/c to 4.1GHz. It's was a fine CPU for it's day, but that was 4 years ago. When I noticed the 4790 on sale for $279.99 I jumped on it. Purchased a ASRock Z97 Extreme 6 (great MB for the money @ $129.99) I'm @ 4.5GHz right now (very stable) even with the small Corsair H50 water cooler! I'm using two 120mm fans for the H50 (push pull) @ staying with relative temps.I do feel a little guilty that I left AMD, but let's face it, AMD simply hasn't kept-up for a few years now. Their APU line-up is great for someone that's looking for a budget build. Also finally broke down & scored a Samsung 1TB SS HD. What a HUGE difference. My new build should keep me going for @ least 3 years with a GPU upgrade next year (I have Redeon 7950 currently) I can highly recommend this GPU for gaming! If you can get it on sale for $279.99, then do yourself a favor & grab one.

  Processor was easy to install and compatible with many LGA1150 motherboards. The K line of processors is intended for overclocking enthusiasts, so I can only assume it is well made but more expensive. It comes with a low profile heat sink as do most (perhaps all?) boxed processsor chips. If you think (as I did) that you'll also need an expensive after-market cooler, that may not be the case. The chip supports dual channel memory and at least up to 64GB RAM.Overall, I researched what I wanted and got what I expected. No complaints.

Overheats, reaches TJ Max
","

  Overheats severely at stock clock/voltage. I've never overclocked. It hits the thermal shutdown temp within seconds of any CPU stress test and powers off the PC. Went through 3 PSUs and 2 motherboards, reseated Noctua HS/F countless times. I also swapped memory four times, removed the video card, and did everything possible to try to diagnose and fix this.  I didn't even consider the CPU being bad a possibility, but I've now narrowed it down. There's a huge thread about this issue on the Intel support forums and Anandtech documented a manufacturing defect in their official review involving the adhesive pushing the heatspreader away from the die. This defect was present in Ivy Bridge as well and is due to Intel using adhesive instead of solder like on Sandy Bridge.This is the first computer that I didn't obsessively research every part for, guess that'll teach me.The system is quite stable and doesn't go above 70C except for stress tests or AVX workloads which explains why this issue isn't very well known.Intel support thread: https://communities.intel.com/thread/54032?start=0&tstart=0Anandtech review mentioning the defect: http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review-intel-core-i7-4790k-and-i5-4690kedit: I just tried a beta BIOS for my motherboard that was released a week ago and the problem is not as bad, but still extremely problematic. AVX stress test puts all cores at 96C+ within the first few seconds.  Still going ahead with the CPU RMA and hoping I get a better one this time. There are two elements to the problem:1. CPU runs hot due to heat spreader/die gap and crappy thermal compound in between heat spreader+die.2. Many motherboards are giving ""too much power"" but in reality Intel recommends turning down power levels to where the chip will sometimes not reach full speed during Turboboost, or for a reduced time.  Unacceptable.  This also makes overclocking all but impossible despite the product in question being a marked up K SKU.here's the guide from an Intel employee on the forums:https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23517He even warns against using XMP memory profiles to avoid overheating the CPU(at stock clocks/voltage??).  What a joke.  I appreciate his effort but Intel as a company needs to take some ownership here.  Sadly they likely never will, thanks to zero competition from AMD in the high-end CPU market and the processor working well enough for many people.I have a friend who works IT for a bank and he has this exact same issue but his issue played out in a very different but I suspect a more common way:He never tested the machine to see if it was stable and immediately overclocked with the assumption that a 212+ should be good enough cooling.  It wasn't stable but he chalked this up to the overclock.  It still crashes every week or so and sometimes during games but he's doing nothing to fix it.  I actually put all his motherboard settings back to default and did an AVX stress test.  It triggered the test's overheat alarm at 85C and failed the test within seconds, almost as bad as mine.  He has still done nothing to fix it and the computer is unstable to this day, months later.

  So, regardless of how early you preordered this from amazon you will not be getting yours until amazon fixes whatever issues they are having.Every other retailer has them in stock, and is shipping at a lower price than the $379 preorder.  After being lied to by 2 reps, I got notice that my CPU did NOT ship yesterday as planned.  They have no idea why, and will just leave my order open.  I ended up canceling the order and going with a different vendor.If you want your CPU before next week, be sure to grab it from someone else.  Otherwise great CPU.

Over-hyped, over-priced and a pain in the neck to get this new intel rig working
","

  Okay, some people may not like what I have to say but it is what it is. Only last week (19/09/14), I built my new intel rig (4790K and Asus Z97WS motherboard purchased from Dabs), although it took me two days to get the bloody thing working. I will come back to this later. It was with a heavy heart that I decided to 'upgrade' my trusty and reliable AMD FX9590 and Asus Crosshair V Formula Z rig. In fact, I have not seen a new AM3+ motherboard since September 2012 when Asus released the then new Formula Z. I did not want to 'upgrade' to intel but felt it would be wise to do so (in a monetary sense at least) since my phone conversation with the AMD tech support advisor confirmed that the current AMD road map has no plans to release any more new AM3+ motherboards for 2014/15.I decided to sell my current AMD rig whilst I can get good money for it, rather than wait till Q3 2016 when the new gen K12/X86/ARM hybrid cpu's will be released by AMD alongside the new AM4 platform. If I keep my current rig, it would sell for a pittance in March 2016 and I would lose a lot of money. Only a few days ago I sold my FX9590 for £150 and my Formula Z for £120 (total £270).I was initially going to go for the X99 platform and the 5930K but after looking at benchmarks against the new 4790K 'Devils canyon' (odd name for a cpu!), I could not justify the exorbitant price tag of the X99 platform. Since I plan to use intel only for the interim, it also made sense not to spend so much money. I opted for the Asus Z97WS motherboard as it offers quad SLI/Xfire support, with the first two cards running at x16 in pcie3 configuration (I have a pair of Sapphire TRIX R9-290's in Xfire). However, there is a great deal of contention stating dual pcie3 x16 does not offer any significant performance improvement. After reading various intel fanboy reviews, I was looking forward to a substantial improvement in benchmarks and gaming performance.Long story short, I have been building pc's since March 2007 and prior to migrating to AMD with the advent of FX8150 in September 2011, I have owned 6 intel rigs (but I ditched intel for personal and ethical reasons). So building a new (intel) platform is not an issue for me. The only new components in my new rig was the 4790K and Z97WS. However, once all of the hardware had been installed and upon first boot, I kept getting 'fatal error' and 'chassis intrude' messages as well as a secondary message 'please check your build'. I dismantled and carefully rebuilt my system. I eventually managed to resolve the problems but it took two days of systematic trouble shooting. I checked for physical damage and fortunately there was none. In the end it turned out that the motherboard jumpers had not been installed!. So I installed the jumpers according to the manual. I then installed my rig in my pc and hey presto, it booted up without any issues.People always say that AMD is not as fast as intel and in general, that may be the case BUT nobody ever talks about reliability and stability. In the last 3 years, I have built quite a few AMD rigs for friends and family and not once have the AMD rigs given me any trouble (even my old Athlon was a damn sight more stable than my 'Pentium 3 netburst' which used to crash like a cancer patient all the time).Please note, that the L3 batch of 4790K cpu's are known to have overheating issues even when at idle and thus require high performance AIO liquid coolers. The L4 batch were released with improved TIM and extra transistors to better handle power delivery and heat. You can easily find out if your 4790K is either L3 or L4 batch by looking at the label on the box. It will clearly say Batch:L3 (or L4) and then a series of numbers. Fortunately, I received a Batch L4 cpu (hence good thermals).Anyways, all sorted now. Installed OS, motherboard drivers, GPU drivers and other software. The motherboard is working fine and I have to say, it is a nice mobo. However, there are other issues I am noticing. For instance, some games via Origin and Steam are no longer working on this new intel platform (eg - crysis1, mass effect 1&3 and BF3. Also, BF4 stays on a loop and then crashes. This did not happen on my FX9590 rig). I have also been running some benchmarks and to be honest I am quite disappointed with the results. In some synthetic benchmarks (such as performance passmark), the 4790K does score highly against the FX9590 (5304 versus 3836.5). Also see -Unigine valley (4176 versus 3178)Firestrike Extreme (8034 versus 7562)The above three tests were done at stock clocks for both cpu's. I am still in the process of running more benchmarks but come on intel, do you honestly think I am going to use my 'high end' pc just to run synthetic benchmarks all day?. Synthetic benchmarks aside I am far more interested to see how the 4790k would perform in real life tasks such as video editing and gaming (my two main areas). I rendered a 7.8GB video with the 4790K and it finished the project in 17m17s. I had previously rendered the same video with my trusty FX9590 and it completed the project in 17m12s. I was very surprised, since according to all of the intel fanboy reviews (which btw, are supposed to be unbiased but clearly transpired not to be the case) I should have seen much better results with the 4790K. I decided to compile two different videos. So I opted for my two biggest video files. The first was 43.3GB and the 4790K took 31m52s to complete the project, whereas my FX9590 took 31m45s to complete the same task. I rendered another video (43GB). The 4790k took 29m14s, whereas my FX9590 took 29m8s to render the same video project. This is not a joke. I have also kept a detailed diary of all my benchmark results for the last two years.With regards to gaming, I tested the most cpu and gpu intensive game which is crysis3 (ultra settings). With the opening mission on the ship, my FX9590 was giving a steady 80-86fps (with 2x290 TRIX in xfire). The 4790K was giving 60-70fps (with 2x290 TRIX in xfire). That is the same fps when I had my FX9590 with 2x770GTX-SLI before upgrading to 2xSapphire TRIX 290's!. No joke!. Just to drive the point home, the 2x290TRIX works out at circa 8.2GB of GDDR5 VRAM @ 5200MHz and 5120 stream processors (so no small potatoes!). BTW, having two gpu's does not double the performance as sli and xfire give c.40% performance boost over a single gpu.It seems to me that the 4790K performs very well on synthetic benchmarks. However, I believe these sort of tests can be misleading as these programs have been written to favour intel and Nvidia. Indeed not so long ago, AMD actually sued cinebench because it was found that the cinebench software had a subset of instructions to cripple AMD cpu performance.As mentioned, I am still in the process of running tests and will update my review accordingly. However, bearing in mind the exorbitant price tag of £500 for the cpu and motherboard, I am very disappointed with the lacklustre performance. In fact, the only real benefit I have seen is that my L4 batch 4790K runs substantially cooler than my FX9590 (idle 20c versus 37c) and also runs very cool when under load (does not go above 45c versus up to 62c with the FX9590). Due to improved thermals, my pc case fans do not run at full whack so my pc is much quieter now. TBH, that is the only real benefit I have seen. Performance wise in real life tasks, it is not that much faster than my FX9590. In fact, the 4790k is actually slower than my FX9590 for the sort of tasks I run.Despite getting less fps in gaming with the 4790K, it has however reduced somewhat the intermittent choppiness in games such as crysis3. However, this still does not justify the exorbitant price tag (bearing in mind you can now get the FX9590 for £140 at sale price). I was going to give this intel cpu 2 stars, but bearing in mind the low temps at idle and under load, I decided to add an extra star.TBH, I am capitulating with regards to continue using the 4790K for the next 18 months (or not) but as soon as AMD release their flagship K12/X86 'Zen core', high performance cpu (12 genuine cores at 6Ghz each core, no more CMT so SMT all the way) and AM4 platform, then you can bet your bottom dollar I am going to ditch intel like a soiled nappy and go back to AMD (I have personally found that AMD cpu's and gpu's are nowhere as bad as what critics make them out to be).On a side note, I have read that AMD is also going to merge the new Opteron cpu and new gen FX cpu onto a unified AM4 platform. The new gen Opteron will come as 12, 16 and 20 core cpu's with built in ARM-cortex processors. If the price is right, I will buy the 20 cores K12 Opteron and high end AM4 workstation motherboard. However, there are rumours that since the new zen core will be very powerful and energy efficient, AMD may reduce the number of cores for their X86/AM4 platform (ie - may follow suit as intel and implement only quad core cpu's). I hope to God that AMD do not follow intel, as quad cores may well lead to poor heavy multi-threaded performance as I found with the 4790K. On the bright side, if you look back at AMD history, they were the first to break the 1GHz barrier for cpu and gpu clocks, they were the first to design and release genuine dual core, quad core, hex core and it can be argued the first octa core BD and PD cpu's. So I think AMD will continue with their multi-core and multi-threaded cpu tradition and hopefully be the first company to release a genuine 12 cores high performance flagship cpu (and also offer zen with 4, 6 and 8 cores so that every customer budget will be catered for).UPDATE 1 on 09/10/14: I tested the intel HD4600 with some games. It played mass effect2 at a reasonable 35-40fps (at high settings). However with other games such as crysis2, NFS the runs, tomb raider (to mention only a few), I was getting a very pathetic 7-16fps. I then tested the 4790k (with high end GPU, see below) by playing crysis3 with 'BOINC SETI@HOME' running in the background. The core temps were a good 40-45c, but fps dropped massively in crysis3 (24-31fps) even with my brand new Zotac 980GTX which I have owned for only 3 days. I am also getting a lot of stuttering and freezing during gaming. When I turn off BOINC, then gaming is okay, so it seems to me there is an issue with running multiple cpu intensive programs on this 4790k.In stark contrast I would have my FX9590 running 'BOINC SETI@HOME' in the background whilst playing crysis3 (ultra settings) with my pair of high end Sapphire TRIX 290's in xfire and even though there was an fps drop and increase in core temps (up to 62c), I would still be getting a very playable c.60fps. Ever since I purchased this 4790k over 2 weeks ago, I have had BSOD 7 times. That is more BSOD's than my trusty FX9590 had in 12 months!.Another thing I noticed is that when I try to overclock the 4790K (the Z97WS has 3 settings - default, turbo and extreme. I selected the 'extreme' mode on mobo settings). However, the cpu is only able to overclock up to 4.3GHz (and not the 4.4GHz turbo boost) and I keep getting BSOD. BTW, I am using a high end Alpenfohn K2 Mount Doom air cooler with three of the new 3000rpm Noctua fans (110CFM each) and core temps are 13c, 14c, 14c, 15c at idle (under load with BOINC, core temps go up to 42c, 43c, 43c, 45c). Please note, I could easily overclock my FX9590 to 5GHZ with the same air cooler even before I purchased the Noctua industrial fans (I was using three Akasa venom fans on my air cooler).So I am perplexed and really disappointed with my new intel rig. I shelled out £500 on this rig but I am not getting the trail blazing performance that intel fanboys claimed I would get. In real life applications it really is not that much faster than my FX9590 (and in some real life tasks, it is an underperformer). So I need to try and find out why this thing is under-performing and try to fix it (if it can be fixed). See my rig specs -4790KAsus Z97WS (with high quality shinetsu thermal paste)Alpenfohn K2 Mount Doom air cooler with triple 3k-rpm Noctua fans16GB Team Extreme 2400MHz RAM2xSapphire TRIX 290-xfire BUT now new Zotac 980GTXSamsung Evo 1TB ssd (boot drive)Crucial MX500 960GB ssd (my games)2xHitachi HDD's at 4TB/7200rpm for each HDD (storage drives)Creative ZXR2xLGBDRECoolermaster 1200w pro power 80+ gold silent psuCM storm trooper caseBenq XL2411TGamdias Hermes mech gaming keyboardGamdias Zeus e-sport gaming mouseLogitech X540 5.1 speakers.TBH, when I look back at my decision to return to intel, I realise it was a 'panic buy' and in the process, I compromised my ethics. If only I could go back three weeks, I wish I never shelled out £500 on this 4790K rig.UPDATE 2 on 14/10/14: Last night, I decided to give the 4790K another try. I began rendering a video file (43GB size), with BOINC-SETI running in the background and I was playing Crysis3. The result was shocking to say the least. Crysis3 fps was low (21-35fps) and kept stuttering/sticking. Also the audio was not synchronised with game play and was lagging behind by about 3 or 4 seconds. Eventually the game crashed. I closed origin and I also noticed that the rendering software for the 43GB video file also crashed. I rebooted my pc. This morning I called Intel customer support (08706072439) and made a formal complaint. The lady transferred me over to tech support and I explained to the guy the problems I have had over the last three weeks and that this 4790K is incapable of handling a heavy workload. He responded by saying it may be possible that the cpu is faulty (albeit very unlikely, in fact he was adamant about this). I responded by saying this outcome is much worse for intel if the cpu is not faulty (as it means intel cpu's are over-hyped and over-priced crap).He advised that bearing in mind the sort of work I am doing, the quad core 4790K is not enough and that I should really be looking at purchasing at least the 5930K. I told him this is downright criminal as I am not going to be extorted £430 just for the 5930K cpu. I also asked why is it that my previous AMD FX9590 and Asus FZ were able to handle this sort of workload without skipping a beat (despite temperature increases to 62c)?. He responded by saying he cannot comment on AMD cpu's. He apologised for the inconvenience caused and suggested I should RMA the 4790K to the retailer if I am unhappy with it's performance.Since this morning I have been on forums trying to find out the reason for this under-performance. I managed to communicate with a very knowledgeable techie and he explained that the intel hyper-threading facility on the quad core 4790K is a very poor substitute for actual physical processing cores. Hyper-threading will boost the 4790K quad core performance by only c.20-30% (depending on application). He explained the AMD BD/PD/Steamroller cpu's are superior in running multi-threaded applications compared to intel quad cores (due to actual 8 physical processing cores). Looking back, it makes sense why the intel tech support guy was saying I need to be looking at either the 6 core 5930K or 8 core 5960X cpu to undertake the sort of work I do. However, I will not be held to ransom for the 5930K (£430) and 5960X (£750) cpu's. I also found an interesting TekSyndicate review on youtube where Logan stated that consumers are taking a very big silicone lottery when purchasing intel cpu's (as intel is playing very loose with the quality of silicone they are using on their cpu's). Yesterday, I RMA'd this intel 4790K cpu and I purchased a brand new FX9590 cpu and Asus FZ mobo, which have arrived today and which I will install after posting this updated review. I have also decided to downgrade my rating for the 4790K from 3 stars to 2 stars.UPDATE 3 on 17/10/14: I installed my new FX9590 and Asus FZ on 14/10/14. Upon first boot, everything booted up without hassle. I installed OS, mobo drivers, 980GTX drivers and updated BIOS. I have been using my new FX9590 rig for 3 days now and it is working like a dream. Completely hassle free. I am no longer having problems with any of my games (all games are working perfectly). More importantly, I have not had a single BSOD or any other type of crash or failure. After 4 weeks of constant headache and disappointments with the 4790K, this FX9590 is a breath of fresh air. I tested my FX9590 with the same heavy workload I used with the 4790K (BOINC-SETI running in background, rendering the same 43.3GB video file and playing crysis3 at the same time). I also threw in an extra task as I wanted to download some youtube pc tech reviews and UFO documentaries.Prior to starting these tasks, my FX9590 was at 35c idle. When I was running all four tasks at the same time, I had FRAPS running in the background when I was playing crysis3 (ultra setting). I was getting 47-57 fps with an average of 52fps (this is with my new 980GTX). Smooth game play with no stuttering or glitching. My FX9590 temperature was 52c and my 980GTX was 73c (when running all four tasks). My FX9590 took slightly longer to render the 43.3GB video file at 31m51s (on account of running 4 heavy workload tasks at the same time and running the 5th program - FRAPS).I am incredibly pleased with my FX9590. It really is a trooper. BTW, I forgot to mention but I ran this heavy workload test at stock clock of 4.7GHz. If I had oc'd my FX9590 to the 5GHz turbo boost speed, then I am sure it would have performed even better.The sterling performance of the FX9590 is in stark contrast to the impotent, gasping, wheezing effort of the 4790K (which could not run even 3 demanding programs simultaneously!). The subsequent generational iterations of Bulldozer (viz. PD, steamroller and upcoming excavator) are respect worthy designs but it is a travesty that AMD scrapped steamroller and excavator designs for the AM3+ platform, as they could not afford to R&D and implement these designs for AM3+ and the APU's. It really is a shame as I would have liked to have these chips in my rig.There is also the cost aspect to consider, £500 for the 4790k rig versus £320 for the FX9590 rig (£160 each for mobo and cpu). That is a massive saving of £180. You would be far better served using that £180 towards high spec DDR3 RAM, or towards a 970GTX, 980GTX or even a second 290/X to put in xfire. You could even use that £180 to buy the new Zalman 1250 watts 80+ gold psu with 5 years warranty for £150 here on Amazon (and you would still have £30 left over). Bearing in mind the massive disparity in price between AMD and intel and (in my experience), the very little performance gain with intel, I cannot justify spending £500 just because it is intel. I want 'bang for buck' and intel has ALWAYS failed to deliver on this (heck, even the old 3770K is only £20 less than the 4790K!).So guys, please learn from my very costly mistake. Please save your money and support the under-dog. AMD is second fiddle but have patience as AMD will be releasing the new gen high performance 'zen' cpu (Q3 2016) and even Jim Keller said the new K12 will be the definitive game changer. AMD went hell for leather this time as they brought back the two legendary heavy hitters (Jim Keller for cpu design and Raja Koduri for gpu design) to work on their next gen cpu's/gpu's. AMD even brought in new heavy hitters like Dr. Lisa Su because they have realised everything is riding on the success of the next gen cpu/gpu, so they cannot afford to make any mistakes. If you don't buy AMD cpu's and gpu's, then intel will dominate the market and as I learned they will continue to use sub-standard grade silicone for their cpu's, yet still have the bare faced audacity to sell them at extortionate prices.UPDATE 4 on 22/11/14 - 'Intel finally admits to rigging benchmark results'. See comments section for youtube video link by 'TheTek' review.Update 5 on 03/12/14 - I RMA'd my Nvidia 980GTX because for some reason it was starting to give low fps and I was getting a lot of stuttering/freezing during gaming. I got my refund and on 'black Friday' I purchased the awesome 295X2 from overclockers for £480. Installation was a breeze and it has been working flawlessly. I am very happy with it. Also, it has been 2 months since installing my new FX9590 and Asus FZ and I have not had a single BSOD or any other type of crash. I am very pleased. BTW, AMD will be releasing their new 380X graphics card in Feb 2015 and according to leaked benchmark reports by chiphell, it trounces the 980GTX by 16FPS on various gaming simulations. The 380X is AMD's answer to the 970GTX and 980GTX. The 390X is AMD's answer to the upcoming 980Ti and Titan 2 (and according to a leaked shipping report from the Mumbai office, the 390X will cost c. INR76,630 which works out at about £790). AMD signed an R&D contract with Hynix and they have developed a new type of stacked HBM (high band memory) that will be implemented in the 380X and 390X. It will outperform DDR5 memory by upto 9 times. The 380X/390X will also have totally new and power efficient architecture on 28nm node. Nvidia wants in on the HBM action but due to patent reasons, they have to wait one year. Interesting how Nvidia is always dissing AMD, yet when AMD develops a new type of RAM, Nvidia is on it's knees begging for a piece of the action.BTW, TO ALL YOU GUYS OUT THERE WHO READ MY LONG WINDED REVIEW WITH AN OPEN, HONEST MIND - MANY THANKS FOR YOUR KIND WORDS AND SUPPORT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

Fantastic processor!

  Amazing product! Mine is being shipped to me now, so I hope to have it soon to verify if my review is actually valid. Someone's whining about reviewing without ever using an item convinced me to post a review before actually handling the product though :)

Not as great the the FX 8350 is better in headroom and performance.
","

  The amd 8350 though is a little faster then this. I'm very disappointed with this cpu. I have very decent overclocking skills and have great cooling (h100i) but it lacks so much on performance with sli 2x gtx 970 yeah that's right it lacks, with the amd 8350 there was no bottlenecking at all. The i7 4790k isn't worth the money unless your stupid at overclocking I advice you TO GET IT besides that you can barely hit this cpu at 4.8 ghz if your lucky. Which maybe some can. So intel w t f please tell me you care about us intel fan boys:( I even got a replacement one just to make sure it wasn't the CPU and a different motherboard:(

  NEW TIM! ITS ORGANIC!  Got this in the mail Wed and dropped the pakage down the steps to my moms basment!  Plastic casing popped out of the box and started shaking!  All the sudden the pakage melted and jellyfish tenticals popped out of the pins!  The chip walked to my asoos mobo and plugged itself in!  One of the tenticals plugged the mobo into the wall!  All the sudden the mobo speakers said BIFF, I DO MATH GOOD AND READING!!........IT NEW MY NAME!  I told it like 10 of my pre-algibra problems and it solved some of the them!  Voice reconition is better than DRAGON DITATION 3!  Not quite as good a Dragon4!  After math the chip flooted up on its tenticals!  It started overclocking itself!  5ghz on air???!  PFFF MORE LIKE 20GZ ON THIN AIR!!  Bleu flaims came out top of the chip!  Big blue flaim came out the bottom as well!  The flaim had eyes and motuh that looked like yellow data!  My moms basement got so hot I started swetting!  The AC bill was like 500 this month!  DANG!!  BEST CHIP!

Dont wait!! Go to a retail store and pick it up!
","

  I ordered one day shipping and it still hasn't been shipped yet.  There is an issue with ordering these.  So don't expect to have it by the end of the week.  I would suggest going to a Frys or Tiger Direct store and just picking it up.  I went to Frys and they had 5 available. I am rating this down one star due to Amazon and the shipper failing to get my product to me on time.The product itself is amazing and worth everything penny.  So def go pick it up. Its super fast and amazing.

Dissapointing logo....
","

  Aw..  the logo sticker enclosed is a very dull standard ""intel"" type sticker.  I was hoping for a cool design with that ""Devils Canyon"" logo on it.  Im docking a star for that!!It also has the standard stock cooler, so don't expect too much over clocking from that.Other than that...  its a straight swap.  Windows will pickup the new CPU but that's not going to cause driver problems at all.I gave up waiting for Amazon to ship my ""pre-order"" and got mine from Newegg overnight....  Actually ended up being slightly cheaper than Amazon....

Tis cpu changed ma life mayn

  When i bought this cpu i looked at myself in the mirror, then i went outside, caught a bird and ate it, oh boy did that little birdy taste good, then moments later my new cpu arrived, i was so excited, i went to get it from the mailman and snatched it right out of his hand, i later went inside and fapped to my gold fish but thats beside the point, i put the new cpu into my motherboard and this strange light came from my computer, i went to check it and it was a dead horse inside my computer case, i then cried and gave that horse a burial underneath my bed, now whenever i go to sleep i know there is a dead horse under me, other than that the cpu was great and i would recommend it to any little kid, this cpu made my computer X420 faster btw.

Intel sells old under the guise of the new

  Intel deceived all again. Temperature decreased by 10 degrees in comparison with 4770. After replacement of thermopaste by liquid metal temperature falls on 13 degrees. Why Intel doesn't use solder on a basis indium like on sandy bridge?

Punches up data processing

  In the process of converting 1,400 movies in MPEG format to MP4 and this CPU dropped my CPU load from 90+% to 50%.  While it is pricey for Gaming, hard CPU data processing is much improved with this over a Haswell i5

A $340 CPU that is actually value for money....In a sense.
","

  If you are the sort of guy who wants to invest in over $200 in Z-motherboards and cooling just to overclock a $240 4690K, I suggest you buy this instead to pair it with a budget mobo for around the same price, run it at the stock 4GHz and call it a day.For instance a very CPU-dependent and heavily multithreaded game like Battlefield 4, the hyperthreading in the 4790K gives a ~20% boost over non-HT Haswell parts at the same frequency, which is much more than whatever ~300MHz or so extra realistically from you can get by overclocking a 4690K. Besides, everybody except a small niche will be entirely satisfied by the features a budget H81 mobo already provides.
