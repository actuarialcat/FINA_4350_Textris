  2700x is literally an overall better CPU across more metrics.Intels screwing their customers by forcing hyperthreading on its next step up CPU. Either of the 2 are over priced garbage with not even 2% better performance than the 8700k in gaming. Do some research you will see this ""gen"" has 1-2 more FPS max in gaming compared to 8700k. That goes for the 9900k as well!! 9600k is the only one I would reccomend here.The 8700k is better than this for a cheaper cost because of its hyper threading.Buying more of these processors is only entitling intel to continue the outrageous price hike.First it was no improvements on their cpus for years. Now it's the same with this ""generation"" but a hefty slap in the face for cost.

Intel 14nm has hit the ceiling
","

  I'm torn with this processor. Moving up from the 6600k at 4.5Ghz that I ran for the past 2 years this processor obviously is much better than the first gen 14nm in productivity. However I can't say that I'm blown away by the gaming performance increase that I netted. Moving from an 8700k to this 9700k would make little to no sense at all.I put off finishing a new PC since March of this year for the z390 platform and it's accompanying 9th series chips. I don't feel like I would have missed out on much by utilizing z370 and the 8700k however.I have my 9700k overclocked at a stable 4.9Ghz across all cores with 1.250 volts on the vcore, but have not had luck being able to hit 5Ghz even at 1.4 volts. I'm not going to go higher for temperature reasons. Maybe it's my chip and the silicon lottery was not in my favor.Temperatures are fairly good for the packaged power. With my H150i Pro 360mm AIO and Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut my CPU will idle around 30 C with a room temp of 23 C. My 6600k idled at 24 C with a Hyper 212 evo. After 30 minutes on Prime95 I max around 80 C and it will not rise after any further length of testing.New build:Aigo Atlantis casei7 9700k @ 4.9GhzZ390 MSI Gaming Pro Carbon motherboard1tb 970 EVO M.2 SSDMSI RTX 2080 TiCorsair H150i Pro 360mm AIO16gb Corsair Vengeance PRO RGB 3200mhzCorsair RM750x power supply7 ea - 120mm Aigo RGB fans with controller

  My setup:Intel i7-9700K @ 5.0 GhzNoctua NH-U14S (2 fan)Asus ROG Maximus X Code - BIOS 1704Team Dark Pro 2x8 CL14  @ 3200 MhzEVGA RTX 2080 XC UltraEVGA Supernova 1000W GThere's little doubt in my mind this is the best gaming processor available for sale today.  It's fast, reliable and cooler than the previous i7, also very easily overclockable.This processor is so fast for everyday use and gaming I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about it. Having upgraded from an old system, it feels so completely different I cannot recommend it enough, however the best things about it (for me) is its performance while gaming and its thermals.Paired with a RTX 2080 this processor is able to deliver a stable 120+ FPS on most titles I tested in a 2K resolution, multitasking is also incredibly fast, haven't noticed any influence at all on games even with open software in the background.I have it OC'ed with 1.3 Volts Vcore to 5.0Ghz and right now, no problems in any stress tests I tried and I've done absolutely zero tinkering yet, it worked right ou of the box. I'm using a Noctua NH-U14S aircooler with 2 fans and usual load temps (while gaming) are in the high 50s low 60s, on all my stress tests the highest temp I got was 85oC under heavy AVX load, which is unbelievably cool for the setup I think. The soldered IHS is perfect for those who (like me) are not comfortable with deliding their CPUs giving us way better results for zero hassle. I think it's important to say that I'm running it in a (high end) Z370 motherboard and it's working perfectly.

A Warning!

  If you get this chip and plan on installing it on your z370 motherboard make sure the motherboards bios is up to date so you can use the cpu if not the pc will not post on the monitor so try to get a 8 gen chip and install that after go to your motherboards company website and download the latest update so you can use your i7 9700k ,But after all that hell the cpu works great and is a beast I highly recommend it.

  Please read recent 1 star reviews. I received a blatantly fake processor identical to other scammed customers. It was sent in an unbranded box, wrapped in bubble wrap, and in a plastic sleeve held closed by a rubber band. The pins are absolutely destroyed and there is dry thermal paste covering both sides.

Workhorse gaming CPU! Overclock friendly. Running 5.1GHz @1.385v

  I'm upgrading from a 4790k. If you own something from recent generations, then upgrading may be unnecessary (depending on your disposable income). I know the allure of owning the latest and greatest, of which this is for gaming.Previous build:cpu: 4790K @4.4GHzcooler: Cooler Master GeminII S524 Version 2mobo: MIS Z97 Gaming 7gpu: Asus ROG Strix OC 1080 Timemory: Corsair Vengeance 2 x 8 DDR3 1600MHzpsu: Corsair TX750Current build:cpu: 9700K @5.1GHzcooler: CORSAIR H100i PRO RGBmobo: Asus ROG Strix Z390-Igpu: Asus ROG Strix OC 1080 Timemory: Corsair Vengeance 2 x 16 DDR4 3200MHzpsu: Corsair HX850i9700K v 9900K:For gaming, the 9700K is ~$120-150 cheaper and you only lose a few frames and in some cases gain frames. The question of whether Hyper-threading is right for you is up to your application. Gaming benefits from clock speed over core count once a minimum core count is reached. I think the was Intel's rationale in offering the 9700K. It's a budget 8 core unlocked 9th gen cpu with no Hyper-threading.The 9900K is the obvious superior choice for multi-threaded operations and encoding. If you're looking for a powerful encoding cpu for broadcasting/recording, the 9900K will be a budget buy beating out the entry X-series HEDT chips by at least half the price.If you are looking for a high performance gaming cpu, this should be on your short list. Gaming benchmarks comparing the 9700K v 9900K show negligible differences. I'll leave the AMD debate/comparisons for others.I'll let the benchmarks I've attached speak for themselves, but here is the tldr.I overclocked to 5.1Ghz using XMP I, DDR4 3200MHz. I turned off Speedstep and Speed shift as this brought me more stability when playing games, specifically LoL.Idles at ~40 degrees @1.359-1.368v. Under load ~80 degrees @1.376-1.385v.I have included benchmark screen shots (each paired with the corresponding HWMonitor results) from CineBench, CPU-Z, 3DMark Time Spy Benchmark & Stress tests. I'm extremely happy with the performance of this processor. It runs warm, but an overclocker should be prepared for advanced cooling solutions.

This thing burns - literally and figuratively

  Installed this on a Z390 Gigabyte Aorus Master, under a Corsair h115i with Conductonaut like Tom's Hardware said to do.  Out the box it's running 4.9 for 1 core, 4.8 for 2-4 cores, and 4.7 for more than 4 cores.  Without tweaking any settings, voltages are in the mid 1.2's.  In general gaming use, temps run in the mid-50s with this rig, but the XTU benchmark can push them into the 60s.  A few half-hearted attempts at overclocking reveal that this chip, like many of its kind, isn't particularly happy with AVX over 4.7, and some of the cores seem more susceptible to this than others.  Still, I couldn't get it over 80 degrees C; platform instability happened first, at 5.1 with an AVX offset of -2.  (5.1 at -3 ran at 1.4 with not much other tweaking required).  Combined with a couple Samsung NVME drives (512G Evo and 1TB Pro) and some 3200 GHz LED RAM, boot times are superfast (with Fast Boot on) - blink and you miss it.I was able to push a 7680x1440 three-monitor rig to 60 fps minimum in GTA Online; average framerates were in the 90s, though nVidia Surround had me limited to 60 Hz.  The same 1080Ti could only do 23 fps minimum with my prior rig, which was Z77/3770K@4.4 GHz based.Nearly any other game I can push my ROG PG279Q to its full framerate of 165 Hz without difficulty.  I like to play Rocket League at 250 fps to minimize input lag and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could keep it over 200 and still get what that game calls ""quality"" graphics on both the single-monitor and triple-monitor setups.  I'm old enough that I'll take whatever edge I can get!Install was a snap, watch a video if you're worried about it.  Computer booted fine the first time I turned it on - if you can turn a screwdriver you can build a PC.  And this processor is the one to get - I expect to be future proof for many years!

Great Processor

  Previous Build: i5-6600KI was debating between the i7-9700K vs i9-9900K and after research I chose the 9700K. The biggest issue I found was power usage and temperature control on the 9900K. This CPU, 9700K, runs HOT unless you get a high end cooler. Don't go cheap and get a Hyper 212 Evo or similar model. Get a good quality air cooler or go water cooled. I chose this: Noctua NH-U12S - Premium CPU Cooler with NF-F12 120mm Fan (Brown) . Under load, the CPU can get up to 82C. I have noticed that the CPU likes to sit above the base clock of 3.6 Ghz. This could be the settings on my Gigabyte Z390 Mobo that have Performance settings enabled. Overall, I am happy with this processor.Update 4/23/19I added a second fan, push/pull, to my Noctua CPU Cooler and I fired up Prime95. This thing can cook your breakfast or be a heater for you in the arctic north. Rated for 95W but I saw the CPU package get up to 130W after 15 minutes. CPU cores topped out at 82c after 20 minutes of torture.

I Don't Know What It Can't Handle
","

  I'm coming from a I7-4771 which I was wondering if I should even bother upgrading as it pretty much handles 98% of current games today from Half Life Alyx and Boneworks. I was looking at the i9-9900k however it sounded like it had some heating problems and you'd have to invest in a pretty snazzy motherboard to utilize it to its full potential which my MOBO budget was like 180 max and I wanted a Micro ATX, so anywho I went with the safe bet the i7-9700k on a Gigabyte Z390 M Gaming and of course enabling boost. So far so good, I've been running it a 100% converting TV shows into x265 thru handbrake and no problems, some of the fastest rendering I've seen, smoking my i74771. Also greatly improved and steadied my frame rate in games like Boneworks and Alyx and everything else. I just hope this investment lasts as long as my i74771 which has been a workhorse, I guess the only negative is it runs a little hot compared to the i74771 which can run a 100% and I touch my radiator and it's still chilly however this one I can feel some heat however thats just when converting video files en masse, but when playing some demanding games the cpu hangs around 20-30% sometimes peaking 50% and stays cool.

Needs more voltage than 8700k
","

  I had 8700k fail on me, so I replaced it with 9700k, 8700k was hotter, but needed less voltage if you were to set it at 4.7 ghz, on 9700k I can't even keep CPU stable at 1.3volts for 4.7, on 8700k I could at 1.21 volts. Feel the difference?Thermals are better on 9700k, with same cooling, if comparing to 8700k. It is slightly faster in games then 8700k, but slightly slower anywhere else while using PC.If you are choosing between the two you can't go wrong with either, but mine cannot even keep stock settings without crashing games. 8700k ran stable, needed less voltage too, so it was cooler because of less volts.I didn't feel like overclocking 8700k to 5.0, I kept it nice and cool. I can't downclock 9700k to anything in comparison. So I kept it stock, but it kept crashing in AIDA 64 with hardware failure message. Also getting bluescreens, etc.I do believe I got a bad chip/bad silicone this round, so I am returning this, and bought 9900k as a replacement.If you get a good 9700k chip, you will get better gaming experience than 8700k. If you stream and do rendering get 8700k, but in Adobe Premiere 9700k is better, because it has real cores, and not threads, so in other words both are good, but neither is better than another.The best for gaming now is 9900k, but you need better cooling. 8700k was quiet hot, and needed more cooling in comparing to 9700k.Hope that helps you choose.As long as you get good chip 8700k/9700k will be perfectly fine. I like 8700k better because it was snappier altogether, but 9700k was better in games.So yeah...both goodBut leaving 3 stars due to getting bad chip, it could have been higher, but I am not gambling with my time no more.9700k is soldered, 8700k is not soldered, so this is why 9700k is cooler. Keep that in mind.

From I7 8700 to I7 9700K
","

  CPU came in in perfect condition. Installation was normal. Post on the first try. Easily overclocked w in the first two days of testing it. Purely out of curiosity. I personally don't want to buy another so I gradually increased it multiple times in reserved increments. Ran multiple stability tests w Prime95 Stess test (ran it for a hour each time) No failures. I finally stopped because why chance ruining a CPU that doesn't need to be OC'd in the first place. BUT I will tell you that I was surprised at what I got frequency wise. (Stopped around 5.21 GHz stable and I'd say warm at that frequency. I wasn't trying to keep the Rig cool though never touched fan curves). Very happy and I don't think I even tapped the potential IMO. Maybe half of its OverClock-ablity.The only downside is I like to run iCUE for my setups on mice, keyboard, ram, headset. I use Corsair products when it comes to those previously listed. The 9700K w, iCUE running bumps CPU usage to 11% from idle. That was way more than the 8700 w HyperThreading. The 8700 usage was from what I remember maybe 5% which I was OK w since it's also a fantastic CPU and didn't really need to upgrade but just wanted a unleashed Rig.9700K is perfect for gaming. But if you are planning on streaming a show/ Streaming your gameplay/ and playing a current triple A game. The 9700K can probably do it. But she will easily be at 100% at 135 max frequency all cores humming. So make sure your Air/ water cooling is up to snuff. I am using the ThermalTake 3.0 ultimate and keeps below 65C almost all the time. Only time I saw it go above that temp was w Prime95 running.I'm very impressed w the CPU. I got exactly what I was looking for w my personal ridiculous standards met as well. I like nice things. You will be happy w the CPU as well.***Just keep in mind if you are going run so many things at once your task bar and it looks like the Pax Convention on peak hours. Might want to go w the 9900K and just lose some frames. ***

  Please note, this rating is not based on the performance of the CPU as I never received the processor that I ordered.This is just your basic 2.8Ghz Pentium in i7-9700k clothing story. We purchased an i7-9700k a few months ago for a new gaming rig but didn't open it until now (my two mistakes). But I also didn't think I'd pay $410 for a repackaged (in what appeared to be legitimate i7-9700k box with legit serial and batch id and shrink wrap as you'd expect) 10+ year old 2.8Ghz Pentium from my goto online retailer. Just received the last parts for the gaming rig this week and started building. As I'm loading the motherboard I realize that the CPU doesn't sit in the 1151 socket as it should. Then as I'm watching install videos it comes to me... This is not the same processor I watched bring installed. I look at the heat spreader and read ""PENTIUM"" and ""2.8Ghz"" and my heart sunk. After multiple chat sessions with customer service and being required to get a denial of warranty email from Intel, Amazon refunded the purchase at 80% of retail price.I probably won't buy in advance again because of this which makes building future rigs significantly more difficult.

  Holy cow, this thing does serious work.Initially, I had this bad boy clocked @ 4.9 ghz on all cores stable w/ 1.33 volts, but ended up going back to stock frequencies and voltage b/c for my use (gaming) it was just total overkill and I wasn't seeing any real-life performance advantage.My plan now is to use it for a year or so @ Intel specs, then when it is no longer a 'cutting edge processsor', I'll ramp up the clock speeds and start really stressing the chip. For now, there's no point. Even at the most cpu-intensive games, you'll still be GPU bound.

  Despite advertising the 3.6GHz stock speed, in reality the processor runs 4.7GHz all core turbo / 5.0 GHz single or dual core turbo out of the box, without you touching anything in the BIOS. More speed is usually a good thing so why is this a con? Well because it is not designed to handle that much power and heat.At 4.7GHz all core turbo most hardware monitor will show CPU drawing over 130 watt, 50% above its TDP. I have seen as high as 147 watt with certain motherboards.Some of the cheaper Z390 motherboards don't even have the power delivery to sustain 4.7GHz all core turbo, like the ASRock Z390 Pro4 and ASRock Z390M Pro4. If you run any CPU stress test for over 15 minutes you will see the turbo speed throttled down to 3.6-3.7GHz, which is probably what the processor is originally designed to run at. However at the last second Intel decided to slap on a 4.7GHz all core turbo due to pressure from Ryzen CPUs.More power comes more heat. Based on silicon lottery (stock voltage varies from 1.19V to 1.41V from my observation) some chips can rapidly climb to high 90 or even 100 Celsius during stress tests with 120mm AIO in a well ventilated case like MeshifyC. I have never seen 120mm AIO failed to handle a CPU at stock speed over 20 years. Even the notorious FX-9590 wasn't this hot. If you don't want to mess with BIOS or win the silicon lottery, 240mm AIO is a must and the worse chips can still hit 90 Celsius. I had to manually lower the voltage and run a lot of stress tests to keep some of them sustainable over long term usage, huge amount of time wasted!

A decent gaming CPU, marred by Intel design choices and pricing
","

  Let's be clear here: The 9700K is second only to the 9900K (at the time of writing) for pure gaming performance. While I'll recommend a Ryzen CPU in a heartbeat to anyone building a PC on a budget, I chose the 9700K specifically for its price (about $350 USD at the time of purchase) and its single-threaded performance in gaming. The 3rd-gen Ryzen CPUs are getting close, but they still don't match Intel in CPU-intensive titles like Arma 3, which led me to this CPU.With that out of the way: for gaming specifically, there's not much to complain about with the 9700K. It performs well - a notable step up from the i7-4790 I previously used - and I've had no issues yet with it. But I really would lean towards AMD/Ryzen in most use cases, particularly with regards to workstation purposes (as the 9700K conveniently lacks hyperthreading - thanks, Intel) and multitasking/streaming.With these caveats mentioned, I can't really give the 9700K a particularly bad score. It's... fine? I wouldn't purchase it for more than $350 USD, as it does lack hyperthreading, and I would probably even shy away from Intel's 10th-gen offerings for their supposed inefficiency and (unnecessary) new motherboard chipset. But I'm using this CPU primarily to power CPU-intensive games, and for that purpose specifically, the 9700K still pulls ahead, at least for the time being.

For $340, it is totally worth upgrading.  New motherboard might be required
","

  My previous CPU was I5-6500 which is decent at that time and even today. However,  Chrome was killing my old CPU with so much lag. I got this i7-9700K for only $340 something for a great deal.  However, what I did not know at the time of purchase was that even though they all on LGA 1151socket, they are fundamentally different. A new motherboard was required in order to support the i7-9700K. So yeah, you are thinking about upgrading it to new Intel generation, you might want to buy a Z-series motherboard as well. I got my Z390-A which is working fine for me.  In the end, my computer can easily handle Chrome and I feel much efficient and pleasant.  I would say it is about 50% faster.

  I had a hard time deciding between an i9 9900K and a this, the i7 9700K, but after looking at a ton of gaming benchmarks I decided to go with the cheaper 9700K. I use my computer almost exclusively for gaming and in many benchmarks the 9900k and 9700k are equal (9700K even beats the 9900K in some instances) so for my purposes it was not worth the extra cost. I am someone who upgrades frequently so I don't typically try to build something that is ""future proof"".

You don't get much better

  I'm extremely happy with this product. Given that for gaming number of cores is less important than raw speed, this seems to represent an incredibly solid space in the high-end CPU market. And you're not really compromising on cores either, i7 has 8. The one thing that may deter buyers is that coffee lake motherboards are still expensive in general, and you need one to get the best out of this chip. But, these mobos are going to have really nice bleeding edge features like m4 NVMe slots for fast SSDs etc., so think before you jump. All in all, this is amazing for gaming, even (especially) on those annoying voxel games that hog CPU like no one's business. Don't take my word for it, look it up on recommended processors on Tom's Hardware.

I had to go through the refund process (which worked flawlessly) and ended up purchasing the correct product from a Mom/Pop store locally which cost more.The processor itself is great.  Installation was easy to include installing the fan cooling apparatus (sold separately).  I highly recommend reading the directions and watching a few youtube videos on installation.  The youtube vids were great for teaching me how to calibrate/overclock.  Overall I'm very satisfied with the speed, ease-of-use, and stability that the Intel processor offers over AMD (both of my previous PC builds were AMD).

  Maybe it's my fault for thinking I could dump this into a really tight SG-13 mini ITX case and expect better temps, but under load (with a Noctua NH-L12s cooler) it gets pretty close to 75 C with turbo enabled.That said it's been a very stable CPU and it handles lots of simultaneous workloads without skipping a beat (ArcGIS Desktop, virtual machines, etc.)I  do worry about longevity with this chip and might have been better served going with a CPU with a lower 65w TDP, but I've been assured that 75 C is ""acceptable"" and it's not as though I'm running at those temps more than 5% of the time anyway.Something to think about for other small form-factor builders.

  I got a pretty exceptional chip, I believe. I'm running at 5.1GHz stable at 1.29V vCore. So far, the chip has been rock solid and surprisingly cooler than expected, sitting under a Noctua NH-D15 in a Fractal Design Define S2 case. My Prime95 non-AVX load temperatures are around 78°C, so not great, but not awful either given my cooling solution. AVX loads take it closer to 90°C, with a 0 AVX offset. Normal temperatures under gaming load don't typically break 65°C, running everything at 3440x1440, 120 fps. I knocked a star off the value rating, simply because the Ryzen chips exist, and the high-end Ryzens are probably overkill for most people anyway.

However, Battlefield 1, at some point, changed its CPU optimization and made the game run way worse on my CPU, and some other newer games were also starting to not perform as well, so I decided it was time to upgrade my CPU. Originally planned to go with the i9, but after learning that it doesn't offer much (if any) performance increase for gaming and cost $200 more, I went with this.Everything has been absolutely flawless so far. Battlefield 1 runs totally smoothly, with none of the performance dips I was experiencing beforehand. Star Wars Battlefront II and Battlefield V also both run smooth as butter.I have the automatic overclocking enabled in my MSI motherboard's BIOS, and the CPU will clock up to 4.6 GHz in those games, so I'm not even running the full 4.9 GHz and it's working fine.

  Best processor for the price at the time of my purchase. Januray 2019. Just be sure to get a good cooling system, water preferred as it will run hotter than most. VERY stable overclock at 4.7GHz. Could run higher but theres no need. I run multiple games and programs at once and it handles it very well with no lag and with my cooler stays below 70 degrees. corsair H115i water cooler. Awesome processor.

  My friends CPU, I did not use this CPU for my build I went with the I7 8700K CPU, using HWMonitor which reports 12 CPUs on the 8700k and on the I7 9700K it reports 8 CPUs.  All in all the CPU works fine we have it OC to about 5 GHZ with no issues.

Great processor

  This is, in my opinion, the best processor for the buck you can get right now.  I was going to overclock it, but I just don't have any reason to.  It blasts through everything I throw at it without any tuning or tweaking with ease.  But the overhead is there if I want to mess with it and I like that.  Would buy again.

  This was the first PC I ever built with zero experience with overclocking. I installed it in a Asus ROG Strix Z390E motherboard with a Deepcool Gamer Storm Captain 240EX AIO. I OC to 5Ghz with temps only reaching 78C when I stress tested it. With my limited experience and a not so high end big brand named AIO I was very impressed.

Major increase over i7 6700k

  This CPU literally unleashed the rest of my setup.I had an i7 6700k previous and had no idea that the CPU held this much of a difference in gaming FPS.I used the same components and saw a good 15% noticeable difference in my old and new games.The i9 has hyper threaded cores but this is as good as it gets for actual cores for the time being.

Absolute beast of a card for pure gaming and light streaming.
","

  This thing is an absolute beast and I haven’t even attempted to overclock it yet. Runs at specified clock out of the box. No issues with temps so far - currently using an NZXT AIO water cooler. If you’re going for a straight up gaming experience with maximum fps and don’t plan on streaming a ton or doing any video editing/3D rendering then this is your chip. If you ARE planning on streaming a LOT or are doing any of the above in addition to gaming I would highly recommend considering the new Ryzen 3000 series (3700x or 3800x) for more multi purpose rigs.

  Some would argue that an i9 9900k is better. I disagree. A 9900k gives you very little return for the premium that you pay over an i7 9700k. This isn't the cheapest but If you are aiming for a $2000ish PC build -- go for a 9700k.

  What can I say? It's a 9th Gen i7. I was a little hesitant on buying an i7 without Hyper Threading, but more physical cores are easily superior. I have this paired with a Z370XP SLI, and I was worried about the VRM Temps and the throttling that people report, but I haven't encountered any throttling. The VRMs under load are at most at 60C* at 4.9Ghz on ALL cores. I actually think it shares the same VRM as the Gigabyte Aorus Ultra z370. The board I paired it with is cheaper than the Aorus Ultra with the same VRM.  If gaming and rendering is your thing, this is IT!

8 Threads for How Much???
","

  This is an 8 thread processor. That will be a problem for many people, and not just the creative users (who would never want this) but also some gamers. If you are a gamer that only runs the game, in a sterile windows environment, then this might be the CPU for you.Keep in mind, however, that most users will have a lot more than just the game running in windows. When I’m gaming there are several applications left up plus 300+ processes over thousands of threads, and the windows scheduler spreads all those threads across my 16 threaded CPU, keeping them away from the 4-8 threads my game uses. What that means is that I can just launch the game any time I want, and the game isn’t effected by all the other crap I have running. For instance, if my virus scanner decides to start up a system check, it does not matter.Now, if I had this 8 thread CPU, there would be a hit. It might only be 10%, but the question is, why should I get this when I can get a 12 thread 8700k or 16 thread 3700x and have better real world performance for the same price? The 3700x even comes with a cooler. I feel like this CPU exists only for clean benchmark tests; it’s not a daily driver. The only thing I can think of is a niche use case, like a system that has only one purpose, like a flight simulator at a school where the PC really only does that one thing. In that case it’s cheaper than a 9900k and faster than a 8700k. The presence of the 3700x, however, really makes this offering from intel a tough sell. If this were $199, it would be a good option, but at $330, it’s outclassed today, and will continue to decline as your computer ages (and more and more threads are added to its workload)

Top of Line Product, for Top of the Line Price!!!

  As someone in the reviews (Why are you supporting this)? tries to make people believe that ""More threads is always better"" ... Well, ITS NOT! A faster physical core is ALWAYS more important than a single thread. This CPU is AMAZING for anything. Especially gaming! Which is utilized for 8 cores. Hyperthreading makes no difference if the games only support 8 cores anyways. There is absolutely no game or program this 9700k won't completely destroy. These are VERY FAST cores with no hyper threading. If you want a workstation and you want the best, get the 9900k and you will have the most powerful CPU on the block. If you are building for a gaming rig specifically, Get the 9700k... AMD shouldn't even be in the question unless you are on a tight ""Budget""... it's that way for a reason. You have to pay to play. AMD has never been the best for gaming, nor will it be. Intel has always been a premium price for a reason. It's simply due to the fact they have faster cores. If you are trying to build a beast gaming PC, Just go look at scores produced in the top charts = Always Intel!You can't go wrong with the 9700k or 9900k. Just make sure you have adequate cooling as with any CPU pushing 5.0ghzFinal Note = Intel chipsets are ALWAYS days beyond any AMD or Ryzen. You don't have to worry about all the sensitivity to RAM speeds ect. Just buy an Intel, and you know you are getting a tried and true product. There is nothing wrong with building an AMD / Ryzen PC, But don't let fanboys tell you Intel is Inferior when it comes to performance...

  I just wanted to comment on the 2700x Ryzen comparisions here.I have owned every latest Gen AMD and Intel (up to 9700k and 2700x) and over all the 2700x is FASTER for multi-core tasks BUT the 9700k destroys it in single core!! Most people will ""experience"" single core performance due to game and software multi-core limitations so which CPU is better? I mean it would seem the 9700k is better for 90% of people looking to use a computer as a computer and for gaming. If your going to run virtual machines and heavy multi-core tasks than sure the 2700x is potentially a winner.9700k all the way :-).My Build:9700K @4.9 Ghz32GB Gskill @3200 Mhzx370 Asus ROG StrixGTX 1080 Ti ROG Strix @1750 MhzSamsung 970 Evo 256GB (Boot) + Samsung 860 Evo 2TB (Storage)WIND POWER COOLING - 6 Fan setup - Dual Tower CPU Cool Master EVOThis is the FASTEST machine I have EVER owned and it beats my 2700X with almost the same specs.

  The 8700K has 6 cores but 12 threads. This ""newer"" CPU is just a marketing gimmick by intel and is actually a disabled 8700K (no hyper-threading) with 2 more cores that add no value. The clock speed ""increase"" on a ""K"" series chip is meaningless and also a marketing gimmick due to the ability of everyone to overclock these K series chips and the fact that the specs are lies plus we always have overkill cooling.

  So let me start off I did about 6 months of research on this or if I wanted the more expensive 9900k. I ended up going with the I7 because it was on sale and have noticed when it comes to pure gaming with my 1080ti it's a beast. I can stream fortnite and pubg very well at 720p 60fps. That being said I play with competitive settings for maximum performance and have swapped between nvenc and x264 with similar results. If you're not a twitch partner you don't need to do 1080p and I haven't been able to get that with a single pc setup. If you want that go ryzen.

  ...but let me explain.The store was having a bundled savings package and I got an ASUS Prime Z390-A and the i7 for $489!!!  If you were to buy both separate on Amazon it would cost you $549!  For the deal I got it was worth considering I wanted a high end system.  Originally I was going to go with the Ryzen 2700x and a mid-end board, but the value the i7 package was a deal and I took it.  If you can get a good deal on the 9700k then go for it.  The processor is incredibly powerful and can handle ANYTHING with ease.  I pair it with an RTX 2070 and can play every game maxed in 1080p and 1440p over 60 fps .  Mid-to-high on 4k.  If your on a budge build or not looking to spend a lot then go amd 2600/2600x or an 9600k, otherwise look for a deal on the 9700k.  Currently at $362 on Amazon is really not that good of a deal, and what a shame!(The photo of the box of the i7 says $469, but believe me check the website yourself it is $329).

I miss the threads ... But excellent processor.
","

  It is clear that many, like I miss the threads to which Intel had accustomed us in their processors of the series i, but that changed in the 9th generation and in this i7-9700K.While it is true that it is a powerful processor and performs well for everything I do, in synthetic tests I score less than its predecessor i7-8700K, which has Hyper-Threading technology, at the time I thought it would be the same 6 cores and 12 threads to 8 cores, but I'm wrong.Let's talk about the temperatures ...I currently use an air cooling of the MSI brand (MSI Cooling Core Frozr XL), so far it has been working out, although sometimes it reaches 50 degrees without load, but it has never reached the 80 degrees that I would worry about.I emphasize that I still have and use the NZXT H440 cabinet, where this processor is installed, the air flow is not the best, it has two 140mm fans on the front, two 120mm on the top and one on the back, despite how closed it is, it delivers an acceptable air flow to keep this i7-9700k at good temperatures.In short, it did not come out so hot with what the i7-8700K is.About OverClock potential:Having a very limited cooling by air, we could not reach or exceed the mystics 5.1Ghz, our i7-9700K remains stable in the 4.5Ghz with voltage of 1.27v, on a motherboard MSI Z370 Gaming M5 (MSI Z370 GAMING M5 ) with its respective update for support of the 9th generation.According to my tests, if you have a more powerful cooling and an adequate air flow inside the cabinet, and you get a high quality PCB, you could take it beyond the 5.1Ghz.Would you recommend changing from an i7-8700K to an i7-9700K?I will be honest and direct, it would not be convenient to change this processor, since the real power delivered, is very similar to its predecessor, in some programs it yields more and in many others less, in game you will not notice great improvements, not to say null , in itself there is no reason to unpack this amount for a gain of just 3 to 5% in isolated cases.Now, if you are planning to build a PC, then I recommend you go for the latest mature technology in the market and where this i7-9700K processor will be advantageous, advantageous for the life cycle, whether we like it or not, previous generations they are discontinued.But the most important thing is to determine what to use and what budget you have.

Good CPU, a bit pricey.

  It’s a CPU, and a very well balanced one. Its exactly what you’d expect. The price can be a bit high for direct computing power, especially with the lack of support for hyper threading, dropped from last i7’s gen. Though, hyper threading has a very small impact on games, so if thats what you’re using this for, its good. With any OC ready, good modern Z390 motherboard and a good cooling set up, you can pushing this thing to 5ghz. I’d despite the high price, I’d recommend it. I’d also recommend downloading Intel’s extreme tuning utility, so you can play around everything. While it comes out of the box at 3.6Ghz, I’d recommend pushing it to 4.5, 4.7 for good gaming results.

That said, I did have to do a BIOS update before this processor would work.  I have an MSI motherboard and their BIOS Flashback+ feature to flash the BIOS from a file on a USB drive was a godsend.

Multi task streaming pc
","

  Great chip for gaming and streaming. The performance has been very good with temperatures being very manageable. As far as price to performance maybe a slight over pay but generally worth it for what I was using it for.
