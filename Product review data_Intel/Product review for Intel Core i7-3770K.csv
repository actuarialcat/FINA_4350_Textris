Still A Great CPU To Update An Older Machine
","

  Great product. I’m not a gamer.  Installation instructions were clear. Actually installing was tricky. Aligning the pins to the sockets on the MB without bending the pins required a steady hand and a little adjustment of a line of the pins. I complicated the installation by mounting the MB in the case first. The wires inside made it hard to access the CPU socket. I didn’t use the included heat sink. I used a third party fluid filled cooling system. The CPU is outstanding. The speed is amazing working with 32GB of RAM and a 240GB SSD. Configuring the BIOS was difficult for me. All the specs for the CPU were not included with the unit. It took an internet search to get the info. This is no longer the big kid on the block but if you have an older machine that you want to upgrade this is they way to go.

Stable and durable

  I purchased the i7-3770K for my work station because I wanted a processor that wold last and be competitive as time went by. 7 years later still works strong and handles current programs with no problem. After 7 years I have decided that for the first time I will overclock it to see how it compares to newer processors and software.

Its Fast... Really really really fast
","

  I'm a huge AMD fan, mostly for the price per Gigahertz compared to Intel. However, in recent years, Intel has been steadily lowering their prices all while still kicking AMD's butt, on just about every benchmark chart. Arguments can be made for AMD that the difference in speed does not justify the price. Well, I'd love to tell that to my new Core i7-3770K process, but I just can't catch it. Its actually too dang fast!... I'm not accustomed to this much speed and computing power. Teamed with my Samsung 245GB SSD hard drive and 16GB 1600Mhz RAM, I can barely keep up with my computer. For the first time in years, my computer is running faster and smoother than I can ever remember, and I haven't purchased my gaming video card yet.PRO'sFast, Fast, really ridiculously fast!!!!!Runs cool in my large ATX case (I've heard complains about heat from others, but I haven't seen it)ADVICE - Use a larger mid ATX or Full ATX case if you are going to use the OEM cooling fan. Otherwise, buy a nice aftermarket cooler and save yourself the drama and headache. People are ridiculous sometimes! They talk and act like heat is some new concept Intel introduced in these icore chips. Exactly what were they expecting to happen when you increase the frequency, cache, and add additional cores, but keep the die the same size? Be reasonable people! Go out and buy a nice cooler if you want to lower your temps, or get a larger case and stop giving a great processor low scores because YOU don't know any better.

Big Difference over i5 3330
","

  Well, I got a really good deal on my HP Envy H8-1418 with 8 gig of ram and an i5 3330 processor, so instead of building this time, I bought because the Envy has a really nice looking case.  Since then, I have disabled the UEIF Bios, and added an Intel 520 Series 480 gig c: drive and an Intel same series 240 gig D: drive. The Hp Formosa Motherboard uses an Intel Z75 chipset,and is actually a pretty decent board made by Pegatron, and as I understand, Pegatron also makes Asus. I then added a Corsair 750 watt power supply, so I could run my Nvida GTX 660 TI video card, plus adding 16 gig of Corsair Vengeance Ram purchased here as with the Intel drives. Last night I received my Intel 3770k processor and installed it, and overclocked it to a mere 4 GHZ. I then ran my read write program on my Intel drive.  With the i5, my seq read was 420.21 MB/s and my write was 219.71 MB/s  With the i7, I reran the test, and on my God what an improvement. Read jumped to 508.55 and write jumped t 296.71 MB/s. This processor is soooooooooo smooth and lightning fast, it was worth every dime. I built my last computer which ran an AMD Athlon 6000 3 GHz, overclocked to 3.8 GHz, and even today it will play any game out there. However, The thing I really love about Intel even though it costs more, is the way all of their components work so well and smooth together.  They own me now.  And buy the way, HP support has been extremely helpful in walking me through some of these upgrades.  They also said to keep all of my old parts and if warranty service in needed, return it to mfg condition and send it in. So 5 stars for Intel, and 5 Stars for HP's new line of Envy and Phoenix Desktops. They are really nice and nice looking to boot.UPDATE:For years many friends have told me I should start building custom computers. So I did, and boy has my business taken off. My first build was for my daughter using this processor, the Intel DZ77GA-70K Extreme Motherboard, Corsair 850 watt PSU, MSI Twin Freeze GTX 680 Video Card, 32 Gig of Corsair Vengeance PC 12800 DDR-3 1600 MHZ Ram, Intel 520 Series 480 GIG SSD, and a 500 gig Western Digital Raptor D; drive coupled with the Intel liquid solution cooling overclocked to 4.5 GHz. What a combo, and I have more orders than I can handle. The reason I say this is because today I was chatting with Marvin in customer support at Intel. We have become friends, and I asked him if I build a socket 2011 with and Intel DX79SR Motherboard and 3970K extreme processor, would it be faster, and he said no. It would just have more cores and a duel ram channels. So the above is a very fast combo and boots into Windows 8 in 12 seconds. So of course he asked me if I was crazy or just had money to burn and I said no. He told me not to wast my money. This is the best working combo out there, and I have 15 of these out there without a single problem. You cannot overload this processor, and I have two more orders. I hope they don't run out of motherboards! Very fast and smooth machine, and works perfect with Windows 8 pro. No Driver problems, and 8 SATA ports. 4 6 GBPS ports and 4 Sata 3 ports in the feature rich motherboard. I also built the AMD FX 8350 with an Asus board. It is really fast, but nothing touches this I7 for the money, and Intel's Visual bios is awesome. AMD has lost a long time customer.Dale

  Replaced an Intel i5 dual core 2.6GHz CPU with this one on two systems both with the same motherboard. Installation was very easy but I did need to upgrade the BIOS on both motherboards before installation of this new CPU.That was not an issue with this product, though. So before you install any new CPU, find out what the minimum BIOS level is required by your motherboard to support this (or any) new CPU and install that first or your new CPU will not work. The Intel web site does have that information even if it can be a bit hard to find.

Compiles a Linux Kernel Within 6 Minutes -j5

  Using Gentoo genkernel and =sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-3.4.9, I was able to time a kernel compile within six minutes using make -j3 or -j5.  This CPU sings with:

ASUS P8Z77-V LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard

I tried mounting ~5GB of the RAM as /var/tmp/portage, and I don't think it increased compile time at all, if anything the compile time was slightly more by a second or so.  I'm guessing, it's all the transactions between the buses creates more overhead then using the hard drive for untarring and building the sources on.HD4000 graphics chip also run pretty compariable to, but not as fast as a NVidia GeForce 6200GS AGP.  However, the HD4000 appears to have absolutely no problems playing HD video with apparently little CPU usage.Package managers for Operating Systems, usually coded in Python or scripting, complete your command incantation within a second or so!VirtualBox runs very well having a Windows XP guest use only one CPU!  WindowsXP runs as if there were no host and then some.  VirtualBox is able to use the VT features of the CPU, even though this P8Z77 chipset board has limited VT features.  The CPU usage during using one virtual guest was also extremely minimal.  Memory usage was also somewhat minimal, which makes me really glad I bought the 32GB maximum amount of RAM for this board.The main reason I needed to upgrade my 2x750 P3 440BX w/ 1GB RAM was to be able to surf the web even though I use noscript/adblock with Mozilla Seamonkey.  Now, my current setup with DWM (Window Manager) runs exponentially faster and I still have no desire to use Gnome or KDE.  But, I can use Gnome, KDE and WindowsXP without any problems with this CPU with all eye-candy features turned on!This chip seems to run about ~80-82F with an after market third party fan and well ventilated case as listed below.  One website (phoronix.com) apparently using the stock fan performed a comparison against AMD, had temperatures of around 100-122F. But the case they used for the review was one of those tiny tight mini cases.  The i7 3770K w/ HD4000 was the top performer.

Supposedly, this CPU w/ HD4000 will hardware encode and decode H.264 video using vaapi. (See Gentoo USE Flag vaapi.)  Also, MPEG2 is also hardware decoded.Very pleased I stuck with everybody else and bought this CPU.  (Tomorrow, there'll be a CPU double the speed of this on.)2012.11.07 - I just returned the ASUS and bought a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UP7 motherboard.  I can now do ""make -j8"" compiles without any apparent issues.  I'm not sure if the source of the problem is the additional video card off-loading graphics or the previous ASUS's motherboard bus.  I'm thinking the later as I did try separate attempts with the iGPU & video card.  The ASUS P8Z77-V has a legacy PCI bus, and I saw a few other issues, but am dumb founded as it shouldn't be an issue.  Anyways, it's nice to see ""make -j8"" loading up all CPU's here. ;-)

Got this to replace old defective i5
","

  I got this to replace and i5 Sandy Bridge processor that I had had for maybe around two or three years. I got this as a last resort actually. I had been having problems with my computer and I had tested or replaced just about every component except for this one. My computer would just ""blow up"" and not turn on every once and a while and I would have to play musical chairs with my components and eventually it would come back on. I would also have problems using all four RAM slots on my computer, as it would sometimes ""blow up"" and not boot up again unless I used three of the four slots. I replaced the motherboard, played musical chairs with the RAM, tested the power source all on its own, pull the video card out, test the HDD, nothing seemed to fully fix the problem. Finally decided to break down and buy a new processor, and it worked like a charm. Never over-clocked the i5, might try to with this one eventually, if it lasts long enough for me to need to.

This CPU is AWESOME for its price. IVY Bridges are the best Quad Core out there. Pefect for Gaming if not overkill.
","

  I highly recommend this processor for anyone. This is a great top of the line processor and has been amazing. The only people who should not get this is people who have unlimited money and that love to overclock a machine to the fullest extent just to show how high it could go. Unless you're that person you should get this processor. It has been reported there is heat problems with the new Ivy Bridges. I have not seen my processor go over 38C with not being overclocked. Those concerns were for overclocking this cpu and I have not overclocked it yet because I have not felt the need. It is performing way above what is needed to run any game out there on its highest setting flawlessly so i have not found the need to overclock it. Nothing has even come close to fully utilizing this CPU.My set up includes the following: Asus Formula Z77, GTX 680, 16GB Corsair Vengeance 1600, AX850, Samsung 830 SSD, and Cooler Master Haf X. At one point I had 50 Internet Explore browsers sessions open, was running a MKV 1080p Video file in Windows Media Player, and had Crysis 2 running. The CPU was at 14% usage and the memory was at 30%. So this Quad core is almost overkill for gamming. But For 320 bucks it's the perfect price range. Going with anything lower is something you will regret in the future unless you build one of these ever year. You really do not get that much more out of the 3930K Hex core unless you're just trying to look cool from getting crazy numbers from overclocking. I would go with this Processor. Those numbers do not help you gaming experience or any other multimedia activity. I would save the 200 dollars and get the GTX 680 vs the getting the 660 Ti or 670. The only question is the endurance of this CPU. So far I am extremely impressed. I will update the review if any problems arise in the near future.

Best CPU out there (modulo 2011)
","

  Yes, there are still better CPUs out there, but this one is still insanely fast.  I moderately overclocked it to 46 ghz on my MSI board.  It could go higher, but I don't need any more speed than this (with the new clock per clock performance, this is a little above a 4.8 ghz sandy bridge).  All the added features, such as a great virtu MVP, rapid start and storage, a GPU that's usable make it more attractive than sandy, and clock speed and efficiency make it better than every AMD offering.One qualm (which is just a business oriented thing) is that the stock thermal interface material that intel uses (underneath the IHS) is quite crappy.  I notice 2 of my cores about 10C higher than the other 2.  Replacing this with a nice thermal compound has made ivy bridge into a quite awesome platform.  I saw one extreme case where a guy dropped 1 of his core temps down from 90 to 50 with this technique.  Make sure you use caution and a non-conductive thermal paste.  It does help a lot with temps especially if you are going for the magical 5 ghz mark ;)

First Intel chip in a while
","

  I've been an AMD fan for years, so it pained me to go back to Intel.  But all the reviews just showed Intel beating the pants off AMD, so for my new system I decided to splurge on the top of the line i7.  I can't say I'm disappointed. This thing is ridiculously faster than my old machine, though that is to be expected with how old it was.  I'm not sure I can add much in the way of a review that you can't already find online.  I'll just say, it greatly impresses me every day.  I do with Intel would consider lowering their prices a bit, but Amazon had a good price on it compared to everyone else, so I'm satisfied.  Personally, I think its worth spending the little extra money to 1. get the i7-3770, and 2. to get the K variant.  All Intel chips are pricey, and the steps in cost aren't enough to warrant buying the ""cheaper"" versions imo.  The K's unlock ability appeals to me as I'd like to overclock down the road when this chip starts to feel sluggish.  Admittedly, I don't see that anytime soon.

Ivy Bridge 3770K - Great Processor

  ""Lightly Overclocked"" to 4.2 GHz.  Unless running a benchmark, normal usage hardly gets this processor working (looking at CPU meter).  Installed in an Intel DZ77RE-75K motherboard with 32GB DDR3-2133 RAM.

I could have probably done fine with an i5 CPU but if you are going to spend the money, may as well go to the top end and get the unlocked 'K' processor to play around with some overclocking.  The Intel stock heatsink was a big disappointment and wasn't even capable of keeping the processor cool enough running benchmarks *without* overclocking.  So count on installing a much better cooler if you want to get the full potential out of this processor.

  3 years in, and it still runs great.Overclocking is a breeze, as long as you can keep it cool. You can adjust the OC/turbo speed from within the OS using Intel's extreme tuning software, without needing a reboot. It does put out a lot of heat so I strongly suggest liquid cooling if you're planning to overclock.It will theoretically go 6.3GHz if you can keep it cool at that speed, which probably requires supercooled helium or something...

Overclocker's Delight

  If you're into higher-end gaming and performance systems, and you like to overclock your hardware, this is a great chip for that purpose.There are a few things to keep in mind:While the unit comes with a HSF and thermal paste pre-applied, if you want to overclock this CPU you are going to want to purchase a third-party HSF cooling solution as this processor tends to run hotter than its predecessors.If you're looking to upgrade, this is a great option though if you have the previous line's comparable model (i.e. the i7 2700K), this is generally a sidegrade.My one complaint with the chip is that the graphics 4000 aspect of the chip is pretty garbage and you'll get better performance with pretty much any $50.00 video card out there.Basically, if you're looking to move up from an i3 or earlier model, or even from a competing brand chip and have the money this chip will blow you away.If you have an i5 or an i7 already, your best bet is to save your money until next year when Intel's next generation chips hit the market.

  Bought this in late 2014 to replace my 2500k on my ASRock Z77 Extreme4.  It's not the newest but it is still a beast.  I got mine to 4.6ghz @ 1.228v running around 77 degrees with a Corsair H100i.Can I notice an improvement over my 2500k?  Nope, not at all.Are my benchmarking numbers higher?  Yep and that's the only reason I upgraded!Bottom line, unless you already have an LGA1155 mobo and don't want to buy a different one there is no reason to buy a 3rd gen i7.  This was way more expensive that it should've been.  Turn your sights to the new Devils Canyon 4th gen if you're in the market for a real upgrade.

  This Asus ROG Matrix HD Platinum is a companion for the Maximus V Extreme mother board I have in my super computer.  Setting it up has been an adventure, but this gives me 6 monitors and runs quietly and very fast.  With the Msata card holding the operating system, it will boot in less than a minute using Windows 8.The difficulties were mostly me, not knowing all there is about gaming components.  But Asus has answered the phone and walked me through the glitches over the past 6 months.32 gig or ram3.5 quad core i7.6 monitors

  This processor is a BEAST.  With the corsair h100i liquid cooler, got this sucker up to 4.8 ghz pretty steady.  I probably didn't get as good of a OC chip however, had to increase temps, but that you can't help.  I would say for gamers, probably the i7 may be overkill, i turned off the hyperthreading to get it to 4.8ghz (was running to hot with hyperthreading on stress test), plus got this for gaming.  the i5 version probably all you need, but still, this processor is amazing.

Great Performance, Might want to wait

  If you do not care for haswell (since it is a tock in the cycle) and not a tick then 3770K is the 1155 CPU to go with. It outperforms all the FX chips by a wide margin, and is much faster then I had expected.Do not buy these expecting to hit 4.8~5Ghz normally, IB is already known to OC worse then SB. My 3770K wouldnt boot to OS after 4.7GHz, even at 1.5vcore so trying anything more is null. Its a silicon lottery, though if  you get a Malay chip return it for Costa Rica.  A/B stepping seems to be better with OC, D stepping doesn't have as many results yet to really judge its performance.

  I mostly bought this because I like to play video games, and this processor handles any game you throw at it. Paired with a good graphics card, and a SSD hard-drive, you have an amazing computer that should last for years.It runs at cool temperatures, I've run some basic tests on it for full-load temps and only seen it go up around 80. This is on air cooling, and without overclocking.If you overclock and give it a run for it's money, I'd suggest some basic liquid cooling like a corsair hydro series

  This processor is sitting in a pretty much newly built computer as of late December 2012. This processor will sustain you for at least two generation or more of what is to come next. Although I purchased this with in mind it lasting for an even longer period with some OCing once, or if it ever does start to under perform to my standards of it now. The standard fan it comes with will work for you till you plan on OCing, which if you get one of the 3770K's it probably your planning on OCing it eventually. There are plenty of recommendations I can make, but I would just simply say an after market cooling solution like liquid cooling in general is going to be your best bet if you want to really push it. There is nothing in particular weak about this processor, if you are like me and want a faster boot, and you already are running this processor you probably need to find a good SSD that will meet your standards. Price for quality, this is one processor you won't regret getting.

Solid and fast CPU

  In July 2013 I built 2 identical desktop computers (one for me; one for my wife) based on the ASUS P8Z77-V Pro motherboard (MB) (8 GB RAM in each machine). The machines were constructed from entirely new components, as listed below. The components were purchased from various on-line retailers, primarily Amazon.com, Newegg.com, and BestBuy.com. Both machines have been up-and-running now for roughly 1 month without problems. I have yet to flash any BIOS's. I have run simple tests on nearly all components; virtually everything has worked ""out-of-the-box"".Before getting into the hardware review, I'll provide a bit of background. I am an electrical engineer, and the assembled machines were scoped to be dependable work horses -- as opposed to gaming machines. I built my first desktop machines back in the early 1990's. I have always used Intel and ASUS motherboards, due to their reputations for reliability; recently I have used ASUS exclusively.The machines currently dual-boot Windows 7 Ultimate (SP1 64-bit) and Fedora 19 (64-bit); both OS's use UEFI secure boot. I don't currently run VMware or VirtualBox, though I may later on. Currently, I am not overclocking the machines in any way, though I may do so in the future; hence I cannot comment on their suitability for such.Here are the principal hardware components for the machines: Case: Corsair 650D PSU: Corsair AX750 (Gold) MB: ASUS P8Z77-V Pro (MB rev. 1.0; AMI BIOS rev. 1805) CPU: Intel i7-3770k (3.5 GHz quad-core LGA 1155) (model BX80637I73770K) RAM: Corsair Vengeance Black [16GB (4x4GB) 240-pin DDR3 1600MHz 1.5v low profile] (CML16GX3M4A1600C9B) Hard disk: Western Digital 1TB SATA3 (WD1002FAEX) (no RAID system) GPU: ASUS GeForce GTX 660 (GTX660-DC2-2GD5) DVD burner: ASUS DRW-24B1ST (OEM) Keyboard: Saitek Eclipse II Backlit keyboard (USB) Radio mouse: Logitech V450 Nano Cordless LaserI also elected to install the following additional components: CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO Dual-port NIC: Intel® PRO/1000 PT Dual Port Server Adapter (EXP19402PTBLK) USB 3.0 pass-through cable: USB 3.0 20-Pin MB header to 2 Type-A Female Connectors Y-CableComments: Cases: We looked at a number of different cases at brick-and-mortar stores before settling on the Corsair 650D. (I've used Antec cases in the past; the Cooler Master cases were strong contenders this time around.) The Corsair 650D cases are solid and nice-looking from a conservative perspective (not flashy); gamers would probably consider them boring. Since the P8Z77-V Pro does not offer eSATA support (and USB 3.0 has better specs than eSATA), the eSATA drive caddy on the top of the case is not useful for us. Also, I found the quick-release mechanisms for the front drive bays to be unreliable: I secured the DVD drives the old-fashion way -- with screws. However, we really do like the see-through side panel feature. Finally, the 650D was designed before the USB 3.0 motherboard header configuration was finalized, therefore the USB 3.0 cables that connect the front-panel USB 3.0 ports won't attach directly to ANY motherboard. To remedy this, I bought the adapter cable listed above; if you want one, here is the Amazon link:http://www.amazon.com/8-inch-20-Pin-Motherboard-Connectors-Y-Cable/dp/B007PODI1W/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1356639600&sr=1-3&keywords=usb PSU: I believe the AX750 series has been discontinued now. I chose the older Corsair power supplies based on their reliability and the fact that they used Japanese capacitors; I couldn't determine whether the new Corsair PSUs had quality capacitors. The fan in the AX750's makes a clicking sound at very low rpm -- typically only occurs just as the machine starts up. Other than that, they are extremely quiet and solid units. Also really like the modular cable feature; fewer cables in the case. Motherboard: I spent many hours reading motherboard reviews and comparing MB feature sets before choosing the P8Z77-V Pro. I mostly looked at ASUS boards, including some in their Workstation line. (I know that there are many other quality makers of MBs available, but ASUS retains its status as one of the best, and, with just 2 choices of manufacturers, the number of offerings simply becomes mind-boggling.) Ultimately it was a combination of reasonable price and a simple yet versatile feature set (PCI slots, SATA buses, video ports, peripheral ports, etc.) that drove my choice. I've found the P8Z77-V Pro to be solid and pleasant to work with. So far no problems with bad slots or ports; the on-board video and audio work fine. Some of the P8Z77-V Pro comments I saw online complained about slow upload/download problems associated with the on-board networking  (I also turned off the MB wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) feature in the BIOS, so I cannot comment on its functionality; this feature also gets many negative comments in P8Z77 blogs.) The MB AMI BIOS is well-designed and fairly user friendly. I was disappointed to see how many unnecessary 3rd-party software add-ons were included on the ASUS CD-ROM that contains the MB device drivers. (Experienced machine builders typically ignore the CD-ROM and get the latest device drivers from on-line repositories, but I tend to only flash-and-patch on an ""as-needed"" basis.) Anyway, after some web research, I opted to NOT install the following ASUS CD-ROM software features:  Network iControl  (Many on-line posts recommend disabling this.)  LucidLogix Virtu MVP  (As far as I can tell, this only helps gamers -- and even a fair number of them recommend NOT using it.) CPU: The Intel i7-3770k CPU represented the best price/performance trade-off available last spring. The ""k"" model offers better overclocking capabilities; if you are interested in running VMware or VirtualBox, you might want to go with the straight ""3770"" model. RAM: I opted for the Corsair memory on this go-round simply based on reputation and price. I haven't yet seen a single memory hiccup. In the past I've used Crucial. You want to buy the RAM in packages of matched modules (to avoid timing conflicts). Also, use of the ""low-profile"" modules avoids potential MB space conflicts when mounting a CPU cooler. Hard drive: I've used Western Digital drives exclusively for years. They are fast, quiet, and I'VE NEVER HAD ONE CRASH even though I frequently have 2 or 3 drives in my machines. (I cannot say that about other HD lines.) (Note: I religiously replace my HDs at the point that their warranties expire; the 2 desktop machines I am currently replacing have been in service for over 9 years, and each one has had the primary drive replaced twice.) I saw some on-line reviews that stated that the WD1002FAEX model is noisy. The reviewers must have gotten bad units: the two that I just installed are whisper quiet. And the WD1002FAEX comes with a 5-yr warranty. GPU: We may not play games at home, but we often watch uTube and DVD videos. I chose the ASUS GeForce GTX 660 based primarily on reviews. (I went the nVIDIA route, as opposed to AMD graphics, because of nVIDIA's strong reputation for UNIX/Linux OS support. ATI's support was abysmal, and AMD seems to be following suit.) The card runs cool and quiet, and it even came with a cable adapter for my old 21"" CRT monitor. We get gorgeous, even-color images at 1600x1200 and higher resolutions. DVD burner: No issues so far with the DVD drives, though we haven't tried burning anything yet. The burner software provided (on CDROM) with the drive isn't worth much; we're going to try Ashampoo (free) this time around. Keyboard: I bought my first Saitek Eclipse II at least 7 years ago for doing work with my laptop while reclining on the couch at home. We now have 3 of them. The keyboard gets decent reviews on-line; some reviews complain about the paint wearing off the keys. The keys on my original one show no signs of wear. I'll admit that only the violet backlighting color works well when typing in the dark; perhaps that's why gamers give it mixed reviews. For us, the keyboard offers good heft, nice tactile response, and longevity. Mouse: Like the Saitek keyboard, I bought my first V450 Nano mouse for use with my laptop. Soon after, I replaced the corded mouse on my old desktop machine with a second one. We now have 3 of these in the house. Recommendation: The mouse runs on a pair of AA batteries: get a decent battery charger and some rechargeable AAs. CPU cooler: Although we currently live in a city where outside temperatures rarely surpass 80 degrees (F), it was only a few years ago that we lived in an area where temperatures regularly exceeded 100 F in July and August. Also, the Intel i7 LGA 1155 CPU series reportedly has poor heat dissipation characteristics. Hence I opted to forego the heat sink that came with the Intel CPU and instead deploy the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO cooling system in our new machines. The Hyper 212 EVO is one of the cheaper (but still well regarded) cooling solutions on the market; it should suffice as long as we don't seriously over-clock the systems. (I also opted to use Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound rather than the thermal compound that Cooler Master provided with the Hyper 212 EVO. The Artic Silver 5 compound is among the most effective products of its type; many of the expensive commercial compounds available perform worse than mayonnaise. See link below.)[...]

  Not really much to say that hasn't already been said about this processor.  It's still to this day the best bang for buck in the INTEL overclocking world.  I upgraded my stock cpu heat sink and fan to a pretty copper Zalman cooler.  With very little effort this 3770K is easily clocking 4 Ghz and staying cool.  I'll probably end up picking up one of Corsairs liquid cooling solutions for it not far down the road but I honestly probably don't need to.  I just think it looks cool.

  Intro: If you're searching for a powerful CPU, be it gaming or heavy multi-tasking, you've come to the right place. This CPU is the most powerful 3rd generation desktop non-extreme i7 Intel processor available, and since it's the K version it's better at overclocking.First impressions: upon first impression, this processor's price is a little daunting, even with it's exceptional specs and well deserved reputation. I too was skeptical. But this thing is definitely worth the price, but ONLY if you're looking for the most powerful processor that wont place your Greenbacks on the endangered species list.Bottom line: This Processor is a beast with few equals. It has exceptional game performance (I can play BF3 @ a stable 60fps @ 1080P with my HD6950) and can run at max stock clock rate without overheating. So, if you've come to overclock or game hardcore, then i'd recommend no other CPU short of this one.

  There's not much more to it than the title.  I purchased this processor for a new build to run AutoCAD and 3DS Max, and it performs flawlessly.  Intel got it right.  The product is packaged well, and the CPU arrived in perfect condition.  Installation was a cinch.  I installed the CPU into an Asus P8Z77-V LE motherboard.  I didn't use the stock heatsink, but instead installed a Zalman CNPS9900A CPU cooler.  The processor has been running at about 28 degrees under normal use, so it runs fairly cool on air.  I haven't tested it at load yet.  Straight out of the box, with no OC, Windows Experience Index is 7.8 out of a max of 7.9.All in all, I recommend this CPU if you're planning on using processor-intensive programs. For the price, the power is great.

  Well, if you don't want to invest in one of those iMac pro's, you best bet CPU is either the Ivy bridge or the latest Haswell. The Ivy bridge is no slouch. I am using its internal graphics engine with one HDMI connecting to a 27"" Samsung monitor and VGA connecting to a 20"" Dell. In my DIY Z77 board, I could overclock this CPU at 4.7GHz. Since the introduction of Haswell about a month ago, the price of the Ivy bridge CPU has dropped. This could make it even more attractive for your CPU choice of the DIY PC that you are building.

  Most people probably don't need the raw power of this processor. Honestly, I should have bought an i5 for my gaming rig. However, this product will be able to stay ""up to date"" for longer than most other processors. Even running Borderlands 2 and BF3 at the same time (windowed mode) on their highest settings, the CPU usage didn't pass 50%. I mean, what?? It is incredibly easy to overclock (mine is at 4.2 right now which is barely pushing it).  I recommend buying a liquid cooling system if you are going to use it as intended. It runs...warm. Not exactly hot. Just warm. You MUST replace the stock fan though. It's cute and all, but has no place being in the same box at the chip.If you have the money and don't want to upgrade anytime in the near future, I highly recommend this product.

Temperature prime95 x64 maximumheat on watercooling 3.9GHz (default setup)

  Water Cooling (2 Liter selfmade custom radiator)100% CPU load on maximum heat stress test prime95 x64 @3900MHz.Room temp:  25°CMainboard temp:  30°CCPU all cores:  ~68°CCPU mainboard:  55°CIDLE @1600MHz all cores:  37°CIDLE @1600MHz CPU mainboard:  34°CIntels CPU Tcase:  ~67°C  (which should roughly be ~10°C lower than core temp - theoretically  measured on top of the cpu heat spreader, but there is no sensor)The Tcase temp is the maximum temp intel guarantees it to work perfectly fine. So adding ~10°C to the core temps you measure, the allowed maximum should be around ~77°C for not overclocked systems. I reached this in stress test with watercooling, while the water and copper pipes I use just are lukewarm.The problem is the high density of the CPU under it's new hood. It's more cramped together and less coolersize to give it up to. So it's only normal to be more hot than the older generation.The new HD4000 integrated graphic chip, which shares place with the 4 CPU cores is taking quite the huge part and if you are not careful in selecting your mainboard, you will find this GPU completely unused by your system. For the information: Intel is not working in harmony with Nvidia so you can't combine the GPU of Intel and Nvidia (normally). I got lucky with an ASUS mainboard, which uses Virtu Logix that is at least able to switch on *exe, which GPU shall be used. That means both are using their minimum power all the time, which is more as if you just run your PC with only the CPU HD4000 graphic. But therefor you can have the ultimate power more easily. For example is nvidia with CUDA much slower than Intel in converting HD videos now, with the right Software (Media Espresso). Took me 2 Minutes to convert a 1.4GB 1920X1080 video stream with HD4000, compared to 4 Minutes with CUDA on a GTX560TI from NVIDIA. So this onboard Graphic can be very supportive with the right applications and may save energy for older programs that don't need a 300Watt power consuming PCI-E video card. :)Overclocking:As others mentioned in various tests and benchmark, it might only take 1 minute to overclock this CPU, even in windows easily and stable. On my first day I just tried to see and made 4.5GHz stable with just rising the voltage to ~1.2V Be careful with your mainboards OC abilitys. Mine took advantage while it had some ""auto range"" and pushed this cpu to 1.45 Volts already while I didn't notice. I only was warned by mainboard CPU sensor peak temperatures of 75-95°C for short. This was probably the mainboard sensor only. Means the core was probably even more hot. So the tendency of this thing is to heat up fast if it gets too much voltage. I used to set 1.85V later and the autoranger software pushed it up to 1.25V. The trick is to get as low as possible and have it still stable calculating. The less heat you will receive. So 1.2V might be a working number, but depending on your software/bios and mainboard this may vary.Sum: While running on 4.5GHz or similar this thing beats up the 1st places on some CPU benchmarks in AIDA64 or Passmark. For more power I had to update Win7 to SP1 since 1 CPU feature was not used before. The Benchmark AIDA64 advised this and the result prooved the higher power with SP1.Ah, btw: the cores are clockable individually or together (4 cores in total). So you can have core 1 on 3400, core 2 on 3900, core3 on 4300, core 4 on 3600MHz. I don't really get an Idea how to use that feature yet, but it might save power or if you are using software that adresses individual cores only, you might save heat if you have the unused cores throttled down at slow speed. Who knows yet?!With this CPU you will have one of the most powerful CPUS there are at the moment. Only contrary is the integrated graphic chip that I did not need. If you go for a Z77 chipset you can use the full overclocking potential and can use the integrated graphic, as well as a dedicated one. Depending on the MB manufacturer maybe the Virtu MVP to switch between both in windows.I would have bought the same CPU withouth the HD4000 since I don't render videos or playing in low resolution. The software that uses quicksync to squeeze out the full power is very limited at the time. Mediaespresso for example, and this can not render MKV HD audio files, which makes it totally useless for me. What does the speed if the file format I want is not supported? :) It makes me feel strong, but useless too. Thanks to not having the integrated graphics on the mainboard and in the CPU instead it only wastes important cooling space in my opinion and therefor overclocking power is limited due to higher temperatures, thanks to a iGPU that overclockers don't really need to have for gaming.Hope this was helpful

This will run pcsx2 emulator games at 60+ frames no problem.  (PS2 games are notoriously hard to emulate on the account that there were 9 cpu's in Playstation 2.  Blu Ray encoding to a h.264 file were nearly three times faster then my AMD rig.  48.93 frames a second!!!!!!  But I digress.  Overclocks no problem to 4.2ghz.  Not a lot of need to do so.

If it's not enough then obviously there is a hex-a core 2nd gen. (BEAST)  Overclocking is easy and breezy placed with Asus Suite II programing.  Everyone is an Expert.

  I built my new PC around this processor back in September and never got around to writing a review.  I made the leap up from a Q6600 overclocked to 3.2ghz to this processor, which I have overclocked at 4.7ghz and it is currently sitting at 27/34/31/28 degrees and typically goes no higher than 58-61 degrees per core when I'm pushing it.I built my computer mostly for gaming with a slight need at video editing, though nothing major.  The jump from the Q6600 to this is night and day in video editing.  A 8 minute video of a boss fight in World of Warcraft used to take about an hour and 20 minutes to render in Sony Vegas, but with this processor it takes about a minute to process a minute of video (so a 8 minute video takes roughly 8 minutes to process).  With my old PC, any video rendering would make the computer unusable until complete, but with this processor I am able to play games like Battlefield 3 while rendering.I don't have any negatives to say about this processor, I am completely happy with the purchase.

  I put this in a new build (with Windows 8) designed specifically for Flight Simulator X. I upgraded from a Core 2 Quad Q9550. I set sliders to almost 100% with a frame rate of 40.

Great Overclockable Processor

  This processor was easy to install and overclock.  I was able to get it to 4.20Ghz Stable with low voltage.  Even at stock speeds this processor screams but is even more processor when overclocked.  Going from an i5-3570k to an i7-3770k, HD video encoding times went from 60 minutes for a movies to 30 minutes to a movie.  Gaming is very smooth on this processor as well when paired with 16GB of ram and a GTX 670 4GB. I am getting over 60fps on many of my games if not more.

Amazing CPU! Crappy Fan

  The i7-3770k is an amazing CPU! For its price it's worth every bit of it! I have it over clocked to 4.5ghz at the moment and it runs like a beast. Many people compare this to the i5- 3550k and for a hundred dollars less that's a good CPU however this will run better due to the doubled thread count. So if you video edit or photo edit. You'll see an improvement.The CPU fan sucks! At 3.5ghz running prime95 at 100% load the temperatures sometimes get up to 90-100 Celsius. You should get a new CPU cooler, I got the corsair h100i and it cools the CPU like crazy, 4.5ghz 100% load at temps of 40 Celsius. So much better!I recommend this CPU to anyone wanted an amazing performance computer!

  Alone, this is a very, very good processor. Temperatures are nominal (with the Noctua cooler recommended by Chaud on MMO-Champion) at peak operation without overclock. With overclock, however, the thing runs around 78 degrees Celsius at around 5 GHZ. This thing is unlocked for very easy overclocking.Powerful and easy to use and install. The included fan is good enough by itself if you're not overclocking, but if you are, it would be wise to buy an aftermarket cooler.

  Bought this for a new PC that I was building based on Ivy-Bridge and I have to say so far I absolutely love this processor.Nothing seems to phase it, and hyper-threading makes the PC super responsive. Amazon shipped the product very nicely as always. Easy to install, I didn't bother using the bundled heatsink cooling solution. Installed the Noctua NH-D14. So far I'm idling @ 27-28 degrees Celsius and during load it never goes above 48c. Absolutely amazing. I've overclocked it to 4.4GHz and will take it further but considering the performance I am getting so far I don't think I will bother just yet.Very impressive piece of hardware.

  In short this is an amazing processor. I personally am not a person that buys for benchmark performance but i feel this CPU would perform well in a LGA 1150-1156 socket range. At the current time, (2013), i feel this is probably the CPU for just about anyone out there. I have not overclocked this CPU yet because i have not purchased a liquid cooler and a nice air cooler so i can say the the roughly 3.5Ghz is good enough for a person who goes from games like terraria and don't starve to Battle Field 3 and Arma 3.3 Do keep in mind that my current system specs are, I7 3770K CPU, Asrock extreme 6 MOBO, Corsair vengeance 2 x 8Gb kit RAM,Crucial M500 120Gb SSD(boot), Seagate 2Tb HDD(storage), Corsair GS700 PSU(700w), and an EVGA GTX 780 SC ACX cooling GPU.

The fastest i7 ivy bridge processor
","

  This is the fastest i7 ivy bridge processor with 4 cores that support hyper threading. 4 cores with each core able to handle hyper threading shows up as 8 cores in coretemp. They can be overclocked easily but be warned that it can get unstable if you go beyond your motherboard's threshold. I was able to get it to run at 4.6GHz but then turned off overclocking when I realized that the system was constantly rebooting. You do not need to overclock manually as most motherboards support turbo boost and this processor can easily run at 3.9GHz if you have turned turbo boost on in your BIOS. 3.9 GHz on 4 cores with hyper threading is fast enough for me. The CPU runs cool when connected to Cooler Master Hyper 212 plus. I have installed 2 fans on the cooler to set up a push-pull configuration and that makes the fan run slower while the CPU is still very cool. I did a lot of research before I decided on the 3770K. I was stuck between the Sandy bridge and Ivy bridge. Decided to go with the ivy bridge due to better benchmarks and performance. This CPU also does not consume a lot of Watts compared to Sandy bridge so that is another benefit over the Sandy bridge processors. I am very happy with my purchase, this is the best CPU for the price.

  Not much else to say. If you haven't heard the news, if you have Sandy Bridge (2nd Gen i7) then not much reason to upgrade. While my 3.5 yr old E8500 dual core is still very fast and will get plenty of daily use still, I am loving the i7-3770K upgrade. Currently running it at stock speeds.I still need to get my discrete graphics card. But until then, Diablo 3 runs just fine at 1080p res with the integrated HD 4000 GPU.I found the stock Intel fan to be very quiet even at max fan speed while stress testing. But since I do plan to overclock it, I have since replaced it with the Noctua NH-D14 cooler.

Can't Go Wrong with Intel...Needs a Better Stock Fan
","

  This quad-core processor is very highly ranked on the high end computer bench mark charts.  I have always loved Intel and their products, but my only complaint would be the stock fan cooler that comes with this chip.  It works for now, but I am anticipating an upgrade to my graphics card soon and I am afraid once I start running more intensive applications, the CPU will begin to heat up.  If you are also expecting to make this chip work for its money, I would advise looking into a more industrial CPU cooling fan and heat sink combo.  Otherwise, couldn't be happier!

ivy bridge CPU, unlocked for overclocking
","

  This is the 'K' version of the i7-3770, unlocked for overclocking.  The box includes a stock cooler which is more than sufficient for running at standard clock rate or mild overclocking.  It comes with thermal paste pre-applied to the cooler, so no need to mess around with squeezing thermal paste out of tubes.  Just be careful not to touch the paste when installing (it looks like three narrow strips of grey chewing gum).

  Already owning a 590GTX video card I was noticing my 1st gen quad core (QX6700) was bottle necking my graphics on games.

There are some great articles showing 6-cores barely beating out this CPU on certain items (never gaming as games aren't 6-core designed) but that you have to pay so much more on all the matching hardware (mobo and memory).Intel i7-3770kGigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H-WB (will write separate review on this)G.SKILL Trident X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 2400 (PC3 19200) F3-2400C10D-16GTXCooler Master 212 EVO fan <- awesome fan!

Another great Intel processor
","

  I'm a software developer and typically enjoy building my own systems. My previous system was an overclocked i7-920.This processor is FAST... though I wish Intel had more competition!This is a very good processor with PCI Express 3.0 support. The matching Z77 chipset also adds features that I didn't have on my previous i7-920 machine, like USB 3.0 and SATA 6Gbps. Most of the Z77 motherboards support up to 32GB of RAM, but, for unknown reasons, I had instability with 32GB of RAM and am now using 16GB and 4x4GB sticks instead of 4x8GB sticks.I easily overclocked this processor (all 4 cores) to 4.4 Ghz using only a +.05 voltage offset in the BIOS on my Asus Z77 Sabertooth motherboard and found it stable with IntelBurnTest and Prime95. I'm sure I could have gone for more, but I like an energy-efficient, conservative overclock. A ""free"" 900 Mhz increase isn't bad and at this voltage with a Cooler Master 212 EVO cooler, the CPU temperatures are well under control. This scores a 7.8 in the Windows 7 Processor performance score (the highest is 7.9 which is hard to obtain unless you have a 6 core+ processor).I always use a 3rd party cooling solution, though I'm sure the provided fan and heatsink is sufficient when not overclocking. The reason I like 3rd party solutions is for greater cooling power (useful when overclocking) and for quieter operation, so consider a better cooler if you want to overclock or want something that might be a little quieter.The non-""K"" version has some additional features, but for 99%+ of people who overclock, I doubt giving up the unlocked multiplier (the ""K"") is worth it.

  The processor has performed perfectly.  The only problem is that the stock cooler is not sufficient to counter the heat generated as the processor self-overclocks (by Intel design).  Prior to installing an aftermarket cooler, under max load the temp simply climbed and climbed.

  I went from an intel i7 920 to this chip.  There isn't much difference in normal computer use, most games load a little faster.  The real bonus is when I do encoding of video or audio.  This chip will get the job done in a quarter of the time the 920 does.  That is a huge increase.  Granted I also have twice the RAM and Sata 6gb vice Sata 3gb.

Great Performance But Does Run Hot
","

  Good:If you are looking for a powerful CPU and don't want to get to go for X79 6 core this is it. It outperforms my friend's i7 3820 by around 10% in benchmark tests. Combine it with a good video card and this will play the latest games and video edit all day without problems.Sort of bad: the temps will increase greatly with even a small voltage increase during overclocking. If you're overclocking at all you really need a fairly high end cooler. I'm using the Corsair H100i with Arctic Silver paste and I'm still getting near 75C at 4.2 Ghz and 1.1V at 100% load. These processors are more resistant to high temps than the older generation but is still a slight issue.Value: If you are on a budget you can get the i5 3570k for $100 less. The i5 will perform the same in most games at the current time but it does not have hyperthreading so it will be slower in video editing and other CPU intense. So this chip may not have the best price/performance ratio but I think it will be more future proof than the i5.Final Thoughts: Regardless of this heat issue this is still one of the best Intel processors without spending an insane amount of money on a 6 core and X79 motherboard. Its better than the current quad core X79 cpu the i7 3820 but its not as good as the new Haswell 4770k, the Haswell chip is around 10% faster than this one but is $30 more at the moment and the motherboards are slightly more expensive as well. If you are building a new rig this will be great for years to come, definitely worth a buy if you want to edit videos and the hyperthreading will probably be beneficial for future games

Not for the feint-hearted.

  The reason why i'm giving it four stars instead of five is because 1) I dont want to take anything away from the CPU and it's performance but 2)I do want to inform people of better alternatives.First of all, if you build your own PC's, chances are you know all about this CPU. But if you are not, and you want to build a ""future-proof"" PC and your budget is not an issue, shell out the extra 20 bucks for the 4770k. This takes me into my next topic. Yes it's future-proof, but it's also way over spec for the average user. Both the 3770k and 4770k can hyperthread. What does that mean to someone who is building their first PC? it can do alot of crazy CPU intense tasks like 3d modeling software or compressing a bagillion amount of bites into one small file.This means that unless you're a 3d graphic designer/student, this and the 4770k is useless to your purposes. Internet browsing and gaming (as of July 2013) do not require this function.Consider the cheaper i5-3570k or the cooler-running 2500k for everyday PC needs that is still over-spec'd for browsing the internet or watching HD movie or playing most games. The K allows you to overclock the CPU incase you plan on adding a second SLI or X-fire Video Card when the next gen PC games come out.

  ok im not say much as the internet is full of reviews and benchmarks about this one, however, i have only one advice to everyone who is gonna buy it.if you wanna overclock it -which probably most will do- Buy a proper heat sink, i was shocked when i saw the stock heat sink, its totally crap, its half of the size of my old Core 2 Quad cpu, you will get 50 c degrees idle temp out of the box using the stock heat sink.and by saying proper heat sink, that doesnt mean expensive, as an example this one:[...]And im not gonna deduct a star or so like some people do because of the crappy stock heatsink, simply because stock heatsink is a plus to plug and play the cpu and get it up and running, its not meant for OC usage.UPDATE:OCed to 4.6 , Full Load temp: 59, Idle Temp : 30, using Cooler Master H 212 plus cooler. i can still push it to 4.8 with same cooler probably full load temp will be 70-80, but no need for that in the time being.

Great performance and overclocking!
","

  I've had this processor running for about a week, and it is amazingly fast!  Well worth the money in my own opinion.  With a Corsair H100 closed-loop water-cooling system, I was able to get it to run reliably at 4.6GHz on 1.275V core voltage.  I used the IntelBurnTest on Very High (4GB of RAM used) setting for 10 passes to confirm stability at this level.  It did get warm (in the mid-80's), but it passed with flying colors!And just as a warning...Ivy Bridge processors do get much hotter than Sandy Bridge when overclocked.  You pretty much have to use an aftermarket cooler, or the processor is just going to throttle itself down when it gets too hot...thus defeating the purpose of your overclock in the first place.

  It's so fast you don't need to overclock it.The stock cooler is actually decent. I Replaced the stock thermal paste with Arctic Silver 5 and got 4.2 GHz at stock voltage right out of the box. Temps didn't even reach 70 at load.  I used an Antec case with plenty of fans, though.

Worth the Wait
","

  I purchased this processor to replace an old Q9965 I'd had in my LGA 775 build for years. I've got to say I am completely satisfied with the purchase.This processor is fast, like blazingly fast. I do alot of gaming and animation and this thing just crushes whatever I throw at it. I'd really get my monies worth if I did video editing or used more threading intesive programs, but part of the reason I got the i7 over the i5 of comparable quality is just because I wont buy another processor for a few years and I figured why not, maybe in the future I will use more threading intensive applications. Took my Windows Experience Index up to 7.8 out of 7.9 .I waited for a while to upgrade to the Core i series of processors and really wanted the Ivy Bridge so I ended up waiting an extra few months to snag this thing. Can't say that I regret purchasing over the Sandy Bridge, performance increase comparatively is negligable though. About 3-6% better performance out of the Ivy Bridge. The Ivy Bridge also runs hotter than Sandy Bridge, but even with the stock fan it stays cool enough under load.Integrated graphics (especially with a Z77 chipset motherboard) are a pretty neat feature, however I do not utilize it as I'm running with a 470 gtx. The really nice thing about this processor is that it has native support for USB 3.0, SATA III, and PCI Express 3.0 right out of the gate. Making it relatively future proof for at least the next few years (granted your motherboard has support). So when I do get that new graphics card I dont have to worry about compatibilty issues :)I would highly recommend purchasing this processor if you're looking for a new Ivy Bridge. I would not however recommend upgrading from a Sandy Bridge for this, as the difference in performance is minimal at best. No need to speed another $350 on a cpu that does what your old one does except 4% better. But if you're still stuck 2 or 3 generations back as I was, this makes a world of difference, you wont be sorry.

  If you have the money to purchase this as your CPU, you should.  If you're a little short the 3570K won't disappoint either.  Either of these two procs blow away anything AMD has to offer.The processor runs cooler than it's sandy bridge predecessor at stock speeds.  However, it heats up quite a bit more and quicker.  You'll need some serious cooling to get it safely over 4.5 GHZ... not that you'll need to.  It can pretty much handle anything you throw at it stock!

Great CPU, but bad overclock
","

  I am using this CPU for about 15 days, with AsRock Z77 Professional @4.4 (44x100Mhz automatic overclock from AsRock Bios vcore 1.030v) + 16GB (4x4GB Ripsaws 2.133Ghz 1.500v)  without any inssue. Running BF3, Crysis 2 , everything on maximun settings (GTX 680) and it's the best CPU i ever had.  But the overclock is very poor, I am thinking about openning the CPU and substitute the crap intel thermal paste for Artic Silver Thermal Paste and see if I get better results (near os over 5.0Ghz). Anyway, this CPU worths any penny wasted!

Excellent (with Light Reservations)
","

  The i7-3770k is a fantastic processor!  Out of the box (with no overclocking), I got a Windows Experience Index rating of 7.7 (on a 1.0 to 7.9 scale).  The CPU installation is quite easy and the 'k' at the end of 3770k means the processor is unlocked for easier overclocking.  The HD 4000 graphics are also great!  I got a Windows Experience Index of 6.5 in both graphics categories without the need for a discrete GPU (if you don't need serious graphics performance, this processor could save you money on a graphics card!).This chip laughs at anything I give it.  It can transcode a 1 hour 45 minute HD video in just a few minutes without using most of the full force of the processor (my particular trial lasted about 11 minutes and utilized just under 20% of the CPU power including my internet browser).I do have a few light reservations, however.  First, the price is going up (at least on amazon) and will eventually drop off a bit.  The recommended retail price (given by Intel) is around 320-330 (similar to what the i7-2700k goes for).Second, the 

Intel Core i5 3570K Processor 3.4 4  BX80637I53570K

   shares a lot of the great features of the i7-3770k for a lot less money (100 dollars or more cheaper).  You lose 2MB of L3 cache, 100 MHz in clock speed and turbo speed, and the hyper-threading technology when you move down to the i5-3570k.  But you keep the HD 4000 graphics and the unlocked processor for overclocking (the i5-3570k might even be slightly better for overclocking purposes which could make up for its 100 MHz decrease, and even some of the hyper-threading).  In general, if you have software which can fully utilize 8 threads, this processor is probably worth the extra cost.Third, the ivy bridge lineup does run a bit hotter than sandy bridge, but this is completely expected from a smaller architecture.  This shouldn't be much of a problem (very good overclocking with air is still easily possible and extreme cooling allows for some incredible results) but upgrading from an overclocked sandy bridge might not make much sense - unless the HD 4000 graphics are worth it for you.Overall, this is one of the greatest processors available today (definitely the best performer on its socket type).  Any processor which beats this one costs at least several hundred dollars more and doesn't gain nearly that much in extra performance.  So, if you can handle the somewhat higher price than the i5-3570k, get this beast of a CPU!

Love the Cpu, Never had so many issues with a heat sync before.
","

  First off i actually did not want to knock the stars off on this one, but felt obligated because as a consumer im rating my experience with the item.First ill start by saying that im an average joe when it comes to my computer tasks besides heavy programs such as photoshop, lightroom, etc. Im a completley stock setup and do not unlock cpus to their full potential. I purchased this from an upgrade from my I7 920. With this said i utilize stock heat sinks because they just work for me. well boy was i wrong on this unit. I built this computer up like i had on previous installs and booted up and to my surprise bios would not boot due to the CPU temp being to hot, i immediatley shut off the machine and removed the heat sink to find it was not making contact with the cpu at all and worse off the thermal Gel was dried rock hard some how. I removed all the gel and reseated the heatsync making sure it was making contact and i was able to get at least a good portion to sit right ( it seemed the clips were letting go). anyways it took off and i enjoyed my computer for all of a day when the computer warned me that the CPU fan had no RPMS, well low and behold my CPU fan went out and i was officialy dead in the water. Now im happy with the outcome because ive learned that the CPU heat syncs are really garbage compared to my new coolermaster evo, but from a consumer standpoint this was a huge inconvenience and an additional expense which spanned over a good 5 day period.With all this said my computer moves ! ive got a 16000 benchmark score with geek bench and those on these reviews saying its not a large improvent over the previous 4 year old I7's are sadly mistaken and probably did not run benchmarks, Im not a bench mark junky, but i always grade all of my PC's and i recognize speed only when your programs are demanding it and the best thing i know of that will do this is benchmarks.As for the stars i definitley rate this CPU 5 stars, as for quality control on intels stock heatsinks i think they need to step that up a notch in quality control. ive never had a bad intel heatsink, but do yourself a favor and pick up a coolmaster evo or equivalent and skip the inconvenience all together.

  ***Update 06/03/2013: The next generation Haswell 

i7-4770K

   and 

i5-4670K

   have superseded the IvyBridge i7-3770K and i5-3570K. They are between 0-15% faster in most regards, depending on task. See AnandTech's ""The Haswell Review"" for details.As of 04/29/2012, this is the current top-end ""premium"" tier Intel chip - about 5-10% faster than the 

i7-2700K

   which it replaces. The current top-end ""extreme"" tier is and will remain the six core 

i7-3960X

   until the second half of 2013, when the Ivy Bridge-E is released.It overclocks nearly as high as Sandy Bridge and heats up more with voltage. This means 4.4 to 4.7 GHz will be around the limit on air. Note that if you do not plan to overclock and/or intend to run virtual machines, the plain 

3770

   is the cheaper and better choice as it has Intel SIPP, vPro, VT-d and TXT enabled (the K has these disabled).At its official retail price, three hundred and thirty two dollars, it is currently one of the best values for a high performance chip in the market. The next steps up are 2-3 times this price.The GPU performance compared to the 2700K is about 50% faster, which is equivalent to a $40-60 video card. This is enough to play most games at mediocre quality with a mediocre framerate or run Quick Sync very fast (Intel's custom medium-quality h264 encoder; about 300 frames per second on 1080p video).If you do not have much use for the GPU, most i5 and i7 owners will have a hard time justifying the Ivy Bridge upgrade. All other slower chips will see a substantial improvement. Another good value is the Ivy 

i5 3570K

   which is something like 0-15% slower and 30% cheaper.The new motherboard lineup consists of the Z77, Z75, H77, Q77, Q75 and B75 chipsets. The major improvements over the Sandy Bridge generation is native USB 3.0 support, PCIe 3.0 (with Ivy chips only) and SSD-HDD hybrid caching. Z/H/X all have CPU overclocking. The 77s have the SSD caching. Most owners of this chip will probably get a Z77 which is feature rich and nearly the same price (about ninety dollars for the cheapest board currently).[Sources: AnandTech, TomsHardware, overclock.net; see comments for some minor extra detail]

Another winner from Intel!
","

  I have had this CPU since it first came out so I decided to write a little review about it. The 3770K is ~10% faster than the 2600K but runs much hotter and that's because of the TIM that Intel decided to use. Many people who are overclockers recommend delidding the CPU to reduce the temp. I have personally delidded mine and it reduced the temp greatly, ~8-9c less under load. If you plan on overclocking this beast then prepare to spend some money on a quality air cooler or water cooler. The stock cooler is a joke if you plan on overclocking it. Even the Hyper 212+ is a thousand times better at cooling the CPU.Most of the people on the forums have no trouble reaching 4.5Ghz and doesn't require much voltage. I'm using a Corsair H100i to cool my CPU which is overclocked to 4.8Ghz using only 1.38 volts. Since I have delidded it, it runs much cooler than it used to when I got it and the temp doesn't go above 80c. I would personally try to keep the temps under 80c regardless of what overclocking you are trying to get out of the CPU. Ivy Pride handles high temps a lot better than Sandy Bridge but it may degrade the CPU faster.I use my PC to play modern games such as BF3, FC3, Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite and Metro Last Light and this CPU has absolutely no issues at maxing each game. I noticed huge improvements in FPS when I overclocked the CPU to 4.8Ghz from stock in BF3 MP. The game would run a lot smoother and the min fps increased tremendously. If you are into serious gaming then this CPU will eat anything you throw at it.AMD really needs to step up their game and release a new CPU to compete with Intel because their FX-8350 is slow in single thread performance. The majority of the programs and games are more dependent on single core performance than multi core performance and that's where AMD is struggling. I recently got a GTX780 and it works beautifully with my 3770K at 4.8Ghz. I was going to upgrade to Haswell but it seems like it won't be necessary because it's less than ~5% faster than a 3770K.My full rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 3770K @ 4.8 GHzPSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z77OS: Windows 7 64bit

AC Twin Turbo II heat sink installed)MEM: 16GB Mushkin Enhanced Redline 2133Mhz(OC'd to 2400Mhz)SDD: 2x 240GB Mushkin Chronos Deluxe in RAID0PS: Seasonic 1000W 80+ PlatinumCASE: Fractal Design Define Mini-OVERCLOCKING-As we all know, Ivy Bridge runs pretty hot overclocked when compared to its predecessor Sandy Bridge.  Arguments have been made as to the reason of this and it may be due to its newly implemented 3D transistors or because it uses thermal paste as a conduit between the heat shield and the CPU die or maybe its due to a combination of both.  Regardless, IF you plan to overclock this sucker YOU WILL NEED A 3RD PARTY COOLER!!! Whether it be water cooled or air cooled or even cooled by ln2, do your research and find a good heat sink!Most reviewers are reporting that you can reach a decent overclock of 4.6Ghz at around 1.275 - 1.300 volts with temperatures reaching the 85-90C mark during stress tests.  This is considered NORMAL because Ivy Bridge is more resilient to high temperatures than Sandy Bridge.  To be safe and to lessen CPU degradation, aim for no more than 1.5v and MAX load temps ~90C.  For the majority of people out there, this type of overclock should suffice.-RESULTS-Currently I am running my CPU at 4.6Ghz at 1.300v for the extra headroom.  Here are the temperature results during stress tests:NH-D14 in ""normal mode""(~1300RPM)Intel Burn Test: 85-92CLynx:  80-85CAIDA64:  70-75CPrime95:  75-80CNH-D14 in ""silent mode""(~900RPM)Intel Burn Test: 90-95CLynx:  85-90CAIDA64:  75-80CPrime95:  80-85CThe temperatures were about 4-5 degrees cooler in normal mode.-CONCLUSION-In the end, this processor proves to be a true successor to Sandy Bridge due to its performance increase and lower power consumption; however, these performance increases are marginal at best.  This means that if you're thinking about upgrading coming from a 2600k or 2700k, don't bother.  Unless you absolutely need to have the latest hardware or if you want features such as integrated PCI-E 3.0, USB 3.0, higher memory bandwidth, HD 4000 graphics, etc... keep your Sandy Bridge.  IMO, you shouldn't upgrade your CPU unless you're at LEAST 2 generations behind.  I upgraded coming from a Yorkfield Q9550 and am very happy with the noticeable performance boost.  Though temperatures are higher than what we're used to seeing, it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing, it's just different.  So don't let high OC temps shy you away from this great piece of hardware.  Great product Intel!!!  A++-UPDATES-04/29/2012- Bought the product05/02/2012- Managed to get it stable at 1.280 volts at same 4.6Ghz.  New temps are all 5C cooler!!!05/17/2012(FINAL)- Reduced to 1.21 volts at same 4.6Ghz.- Highest load temp was 85C while fans were in silent mode.- Reduced memory clock to stock speed(2133 Mhz), and timings(9-11-10-28) to run prime95 for ~16hrs.  Overclocked them back to 2400Mhz 10-12-11-32 after stress testing since they run just fine.  No BSODS or random crashes.  If I do experience any issues with stability, then I know I need to clock the memory back down, otherwise I'll keep the extra speed.- No updates shall be added unless something drastic occurs.- Remember, running stress tests on a new PC is done only to test stability.  In a realistic environment, you will not be running your machine at 100% load 24/7 unless you're folding proteins or something.  On a normal day of playing games, surfing the internet, listening to music, watching moves, etc... my CPU does not go above 70C and averages around ~60C.

The Muti-Tasking Master Processor.
","

  This processor is just awesome. It overclocks to 4.5 with ease. I went with 4.2 and it's so fast, temps are 26-29C @ idle. That is with a NH-D14 Cooler, not the stock cooler. My boot times are 20-25 sec. You can muti-task and this thing ask for more. I do recommend if you overclock to upgrade the cooler. The stock one would not hold up, or keep temps stable. If you have discreet graphics you can disable the onboard chip graphics, I dont notice much difference until I game. But if you don't game the onboard graphics should be suffice. I upgraded to the 3770k after using a 1090T for 2 years. What a difference between these 2. The intel chip is far better at the same task I do day to day by almost half. I would have bought this from Amazon, but I saved 50 bucks elsewhere, I'm a tiger. For newer first timers, remember just about a B B size of thermal paste right in the middle, put your cooler on and tighten it down. The paste will cover the entire surface of the chip if done properly. I do upgrade parts year to year, but I don't think I'll need to upgrade my processor for quite afew. This chip is a true workhorse, Windows Experience @ stock was 7.7 overclocked bumped it to 7.8. So if you work from home, do video editing or music, this chip will earn it's keep and save you time in the long run.

Fantastic CPU. Fast, Scalable, and Still Great post-Haswell
","

  Ok, so we all know Haswell is out of the gate and running, the successor to the ""Core"" series processors and the Sandy/Ivy Bridge architecture. Haswell is great. I have yet to report any hands-on experience, but the benchmarks don't lie (go to Tom's Hardware and read their reviews). Figure the Haswell 4770k is faster than the i7 3770k, but not by much, maybe 14-15% depending on the task. In some areas it's basically the same with a 1-5% difference.This i7-3770k is built on Intel's 3rd gen. Ivy Bridge architecture which is 22nm process with on-die graphics and very low power consumption for a high-end CPU (I think the TDP for this is 77W). It has 8 MB L3 cahe (2 more than the high-end i5) and runs at 3.5 GHz (up from 3.4 with the 17-3770). Everything else is the same as the non-over clock-able i7-3770. You get Turbo Boost  2.0 to 3.9 GHz, Intel VT-x technology for virtualization, 25 GT/s data bus, support for Intel Z77 chipset, SATA 6 GB/s, USB 3.0, and PCI-e 3.0. It will also support up to 32 GB RAM in dual-channel mode (Sandy Bridge-E does quad channel).It's a quad-core with hyper threading, which adds a virtual core to each physical core, so you get 8-effective processing cores, so this is a step-up from the i5-3570k. It's unlocked as well (the ""k"" designation) so you can over clock it, and quite a bit. These can be suitably over clocked to 4.5 GHz with stout cooling. In all sense of the word, this absolutely smokes the AMD 8-core CPU's in just about every benchmark. The trade-off is the price...It's $340 (depending on where you buy it). The new Haswell 4770 is the same price and it's newer, more efficient, and a little faster for the same price. It's a hard argument to choose this over the latter in my opinion. The on-die graphics set is Intel's HD 4000 graphics, which is pretty good for low-end games. Forget playing high-end games at anything over medium settings.With that said, this is still a great processor. Stock it will be more than enough processor for just about any task you throw at it aside from encoding full HD movies and audio or CAD stuff (spend the extra $200 and upgrade to the Sandy Bridge-E for that). I put this in a gaming machine, upgrading from a i5-3470, a GTX 650 Ti to a GTX 670 Ti, and 8 GB to 16 GB 1600 RAM to eliminate any bottlenecks. It works great! The machine probably won't need upgrading for quite a while.I there an argument for Haswell? I think so, but if you've already got a system with an Ivy Bridge i7 or Sandy Bridge and want to go to Haswell, you will have to change your motherboard to the new socket (1150) and chipset to support the new processor. Your LGA 1155 and Ivy-Sandy Bridge chipsets are not compatible with Haswell (thanks Intel 8( ). The only thing you can carry over from your ""old"" system is the graphics card, RAM, PS, and HDD (forgot the case).Another note, even when over clocked, the Haswell doesn't see to gain a large margin of performance over the same over clocked Ivy Bridge. In my book, it's not worth totally upgrading my LGA 1155 mobo which I can use with just about every Sandy and Ivy Bridge CPU (excluding Sandy Bridge-E LGA 2011). It's really efficient as well. The comparable AMD FX 8350 is rated for 125 W. This is much faster and uses only 77. My only gripe is the price. Haswell costs the same as this, and it's newer technology. That alone should drop the price of the ""older"" i7 at least $40, making it a better deal. C'mon Intel.Pros:As good as HaswellIvy Bridge architectureSuper efficient 77 W TDPHyper Threading8 MB L3 CacheVersatile and scalable LGA 1155 socketPowerful processingDecent HD 4000 on die graphicsCons:PriceSo would I switch to Haswell or stick with Ivy Bridge? From a cost perspective yes, but for everything else, I wouldn't. The Haswell is great, but it's not fantastic. The performance gains are negligible (except in a server configuration, which will have support for DDR4 memory) in just about every area, and it didn't really take the enthusiast market by storm. A lot of folks are sticking with this CPU, and it's not hard to tell why. If I were building a ground-up new PC, I'd go with the Haswell, but if I were upgrading my 1155 rig, I'd go with the Ivy Bridge any day.

  Unlocked, overclocks very well, not as well as Sandy Bridge in terms of heat output-to-clock speed ratio but you are getting essentially a free 10% clock-per-clock performance boost over Sandy Bridge, no extra cost (considering the lack of competition, Intel has little reason to even update)I got mines up to 4.7GHz using an H60 2013 edition with just 1.16v of voltage and temps are quite great sitting at 25c-30c idle and a max load temp of 65c.Also like the Sandy Bridge 2600K before it, it is the most powerful quad core processor you can get with single and multi thread being way faster than any AMD FX processor out right now, with the FX Piledriver now just catching up to the Sandy Bridge series (just barely) using 8 core parts. (""most powerful quad core processor"" formerly, with Haswell out now, on the desktop line it serves the same purpose as Ivy did with Sandy, in sum, a free 10% clock-per-clock performance boost over Ivy. I still stand with the statement that this is a powerful quad core processor and probably second or third overall)

The only draw back of the 3770k is that it overheats when it is overclocked. I do not overclock the processor for that reason. But other than that it is a very fast,stable, and reliable procesor.

Incredibly fast and energy-efficient
","

  As of this writing, this is the fastest quad-core CPU available. Intel used this and a few other CPUs to introduce its 22nm process, so it runs much more efficiently than previous gen (and competing) CPUs.  It's not worth replacing a high-end Sandy Bridge CPU with this Ivy Bridge CPU, but if you're upgrading from anything older, buying this CPU or one of its siblings is a no-brainer choice.I've deducted one star from the review for a simple reason - being the top-end CPU in its product line (as of this writing; faster Ivy Bridge CPUs are probably on their way), its price premium is significant. If you judge processors on bang-for-the-buck, this is a very poor choice.  The non-K version or an i5 version performs much better per dollar.But for those who are willing to spend more for the performance premium, this CPU is great. The only thing currently faster are Sandy Bridge hexacore processors, and if you're thinking of buying one of those, you might as well just wait a few months for the higher-end Ivy Bridge CPUs to be released, which promise to be faster, more energy-efficient hexacore CPUs at similar prices.

I ran the passmark pc test cpu bench and the highest at 5200mhz I reached was 12884.4 cpu score thats close to the I-7 six core speeds. Now I auto overclocked the 3770k and reaced 4977mhz using the swiftech 320 I couldnt believe it , never goes past 74c under 100% load. Passmark score at 4977mhz is 14185 that is faster then intels best I-7 six core for a thousand bucks. Plus this lets my gtx 680s run at pci 3.0 and all of my benchmarks are higher on every thing.Clearly it showed me the performance gains from this chip. This chip out performs the 2600k and everyone complaining it only goes to 4300mhz probley dont realize that its faster then the 2600k at 4600mhz.If overclocking this cpu require pro style water cooling to keep the temps down but the fact is this out performs the 2600k by a good margin. With some good tweaking I will get this to 5200mhz soon then it will be running at intel server speeds.A little advice for those of you freeked out trying to scrong every last penny to get this cpu. Comm down dont rush the 2600k is so fast you probley will never notice the differance unless your bench marking.I hope this review helps people like me waiting for info like this to decide if the 3770k will be worth upgrading to.Added later , I would also like to add stop using prime 95 and any other burn in test to test this cpu. The tests that have been out for a while are not designed to test this cpu and can damage it. I watched a guy from Asus talk about that. Best tests are your pc itself using your heavy programs under load. So be carful.I am using Aida64 Extremestability test.That is the same test The Asus Evo uses to test its auto overclocks.Update 7/24/12 I overclocked the 3770k to 4914.5 and Corsair CMT16GX3M4X2133C9 ram to 1950.6 mhz specs 47x cpu ratio, blk 104.5  and 1.385volts.Temps with Aida64 stabilty test cores 76c max Cpu packages (the gpu) gets to 90c for a split second now and then.No crashes.I found that even though I was able to get a stable overclock higher then 4914 it still wouldnt work with windows exper test.The last settings worked great at 4911/4914mhz. 1950mhz ram. Thats the ticket to score 7.9Now the best thing for me is ( I got my 3770k to hit 7.9 in Windows exp cpu score ) Wow never thought I would see that.

Excellent Overclocker
","

  This processor is an excellent overclocker and performs without generating as much heat as previous generations did (I'm thinking about LGA 1156). The aditional threads provided by HT technology grants you better performance in CPU dependent games and synthetic benchmarks over quad core i5's.  In any case, considering the pricing, I would take one start from this product, since there are newer CPUs and this should produce a more important drop in pricing...

Best Processor for the money!
","

  The 3770k is a great processor! It gets the job done well, quietly, and with little effort, which means cooler environments. I have had one since July, 2012 with no problems what so ever. It easily OC's to 4.5, though you do sacrifice some quiet and coolness. It runs all of my programs, and I'm a pretty intensive user, running a lot a VM's, Outlook, 50 chrome tabs, and more. This is a great CPU for the money. Especially if you have a Microcenter near you, where you can pick one up for $250.Pros:-Powerful-Fast-Easy to OC-Comes with cooler-Comes with Thermal pasteCons:-Sort of Expensive-Could use a better coolerOverall, this is a great CPU that I recommend to all of my friends and family! It gets the job done, and pretty well. I have no problems or complaints about it.

Big Difference over i5 3330
","

  Well, I got a really good deal on my HP Envy H8-1418 with 8 gig of ram and an i5 3330 processor, so instead of building this time, I bought because the Envy has a really nice looking case. Since then, I have disabled the UEIF Bios, and added an Intel 520 Series 480 gig c: drive and an intel same series 240 gig D: drive. The Hp Formosa Motherboard uses an intel Z75 chipset,and is actually a pretty decent board made by Pegatron, and as I understand, Pegatron also makes Asus. I then added a Corsair 750 watt power supply, so I could run my Nvidia GTX 660 TI video card, plus adding 16 gig of Corsair Vengance Ram purchased here as with the Intel drives. Last night I received my Intel 3770k processor and installed it, and overclocked it to a mere 4 GHZ. I then ran my read write program on my intel drive. With the i5, my seq read was 420.21 MB/s and my write was 219.71 MB/s With the i7, I reran the test, and on my God what an improvement. Read jumped to 508.55 and write jumped t 296.71 MB/s. This processor is soooooooooo smooth and lightning fast, it was worth every dime. I built my last computer which ran an AMD Athlon 6000 3 Ghz, overclocked to 3.8 Ghz, and even today it will play any game out there. However, The thing I really love about Intel even though it costs more, is the way all of their components work so well and smooth together. They own me now. And buy the way, HP support has been extreemly helpful in walking me through some of these upgrades. They also said to keep all of my old parts and if warranty service in needed, return it to mfg condition and send it in. So 5 stars for Intel, and 5 Stars for HP's new line of Envy and Phoenix Desktops. They are really nice and nice looking to boot.

Breathtakingly fast and power efficient
","

  I just replaced my aging Q6600 @ 3.2 ghz with this, and all I can say is WOW. This chip absolutely screams, and is extremely power efficient while doing it. Overclocking it is a complete joy as well, I have never overclocked a chip as easily as this one. I am running at 4.4 ghz @ 1.19 volts. Compared to the Q6600, encoding is done twice as fast, a lot of Photoshop tasks complete at two or three times the speed. Don't even get me started on games. The Q6600 would beg for mercy with Battlefield 3 maxed out on a 64 player server, this just laughs at it. If you run Sandy Bridge this generation of CPUs is a sidegrade at best, but if you run an older Core 2 or ANYTHING from AMD, this CPU or its little brother are no brainers.

  It works great. I had an AMD (with Asus motherboard) before this one and it could not stay stable. I play games with it on the highest setting and almost no issue has happened. (Skyrim froze once but it may have been due to a mod.) I am using Asrock Z77 and while it seems to be working well, its BIOS is kind of annoying with this stupid USB pop up that does not have an X to hit. In hindsight I should have went all Intel. But it is still a great CPU. I am using a EVGA 660 and they seem to be working well together. Temperature hasn't been an issue. I expect I will be happy with this for a long time.

  I have the Alienware x51 with an i5 processor and because Alienware's motherboards don't support AMD CPUs I had to go with the Intel CPUs. I went with the i7 3770k because it was one of the only processor I can find that is decent enough to play bf4 on ultra at 30 fps. When I installed the new processor I was surprised to find that I went from getting 40 fps on medium settings for bf4 I got around 55 fps in ultra.

  UPDATE #2 June 2nd 2012... ANTOnline, the original marketplace seller refuses to refund or return the CPU because I actually opened the box and put the CPU in a motherboard.What am I supposed to do??  Spend 400 bucks for a processor and sit it on the fireplace mantle and look at it??ANTOnline is the worst seller and customer service I have ever seen and a Better Business Bureau complaint will be filed.The issue is now in the hands of Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee program thingy.  We will see how they handle things.UPDATE 1 June 2012... This is an updated review of this item.  Originally I left the review below (Under the line of dashes)and got all kinds of grief from people.  You can read all the stupidity below if you wish.  Originally I slammed the seller for shipping this item... a CPU 300 to 400 dollars... in a bubble mailer envelope ONLY! And BECAUSE I have no buttons or links or options to leave feedback on the seller... I left feedback here to warn others of the seller while stating the item was 5-stars.Well I should have assumed nothing... Today I finally got my new motherboard after buying different memory as well.  It seems however I have spent almost the last entire month trying to figure out what part was bad in my new system build.  Guess what... I have now swapped out every single thing EXCEPT for the CPU.  Yes... that means and includes 2 different motherboards, 2 diff video cards, removed sound card completely, 2 sets of matched DIMMs from 2 different manufacturers, 2 different power supplies... you name it... I have a spare to swap in and the result is the same no matter what I do. The system always does the exact same thing.The CPU is the only thing that hasn't been swapped out.Turn system on and everything appears to power up... case fans w/LEDs, CPU cooler, lights and LEDs all over the motherboard, LEDs and fans on video cards etc... But you get no signal to the monitor at all and the system only stays on for about 3.5 seconds ... then it powers down completely... like I turned the power switch off... and it stays off for about the same 3.5 seconds... then it powers up again all by itself and stays on for 3.5 seconds again and the whole cycle repeats over and over. You have to flip power switch on power supply to stop the process.I am in process of returning this DEAD ON ARRIVAL CPU to the seller and I'll buy from someone who isn't going to just throw it in a bubble envelope and hope it's trip across the country doesn't damage it!  Oh and guess how you are going to get this mailed back to you????For all those lovely ""people"" who gave me so much grief upon my original review I guess I should taunt you with a well deserved ""told you so""?????The CPU is DOA.... that's zero stars in anyone's book.  Sorry to all those who want this item for some reason to do well in the stars rating system on here.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This review is much more about the maketplace seller or vendor on Amazon.  This was sold and shipped by ANTOnline thru Amazon.Simple as this...A $350 to $450 dollar plus processor plus $6.78 shipping charge.All they did was throw the thing in an ENVELOPE bubble mailer and sent it to me thru the mail.  Are you kidding!?!?!  A CPU... in a bubble mailer?  With a heavy fan and heatsink included.  DO you have any idea how those small envelopes get thrown around from person to person... person to shelf, person to truck and person to FLOOR etc... along it's long trip across country?  Needless to say the ""package"" was half ripped open when it finally got to me and was stuffed inside my mailbox by the road since it was so small an item with no packaging... a mailbox that could have been very wet inside had it rained.  A small sturdy box and a hand full of peanuts... is that too much to ask??This is absolutely the worst i've ever seen when it comes to packaging and I will definitely NEVER buy anything with this compnay's name on it again... ANTOnline... NO EXCUSE!Additionally: The item was shown on Amazon and the seller's public website... as ""in-stock"".  So it was a good price and in-stock... So I ordered it.  No brainer.  Who wants to order an item that is out of stock unless that's the only option... right?  Again needless to say item was NOT in stock.  Waited a week to get an email saying it is back in stock and shipping next day.  That was 7 days after I placed order and ANTOnline said it would only be 1-3 days.  Regardless... in-stock means in-stock.  If the item was out of stock I would have purchased from another seller who DID have item in stock and had it at least a week earlier and in much better packaging.Shame on amazon for not dropping this seller a long time ago!What can you say about the CPU?  It's the newest tech... 22nm... Intel... should be fast as lightening!!ANTOnline service...information...website... all was worthless!
