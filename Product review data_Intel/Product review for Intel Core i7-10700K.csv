The FPS Gaming/Streaming King
","

  I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel.The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing.This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal.Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back!For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don’t see any need for the 10900k.

Awesome Intel
","

  Don’t listen to the people who claim to have this chip and post negative reviews. They are full of sh*t!  This chip does not run hot at all, it actually runs cooler than 9th Gen chips but has more performance.  My i7 10700k sits at idle 30-32c in an NZXT H1 case. That case has just a 140mm AIO.

Gaming Chip. 4790k to this.
","

  Yeah I know, Ryzens are cheaper, and out perform the Intel chips in everything... except clocks. As a gamer, I want the highest single core speed possible, 16 threads instead of 32? Whatever, I don't need that many for my uses, lol.I don't upgrade often, and until now I was still running my trusty 4790k, which still can hold it's own pretty well, but now with the 10700k, the 1080 isn't bottlenecked by my CPU any more, and it's VERY noticeable in certain games I normally saw slight issues.Should you upgrade 9th gen, or even 8th gen to 10th gen? Honestly, probably not. But if you're say, a few of more generations behind now, it's a worthy upgrade. Yes it's an upgraded 9900k, but that's still really good for ~$400!(pic included just because I find it hilarious how absurdly big the Noctua D15 cooler is)1 MONTH UPDATE:So yeah it's just shy of a month using it and it's been a beast. I haven't messed with clocks at all since the built in boosts do the job fine, especially paired with the D15 keeping it nice and cool. Haven't gone above 60c in full load yet.PC Build:CPU: i7-10700kCPUC: Noctua NH-D15 ChromaxMOBO: MSI Z490-A PRORAM: 32GB (4x8GB) HyperX Fury DDR4 3200GFX: MSI GTX 1080 Gaming XPSU: Seasonic Focus Plus Gold 750wDRIVES: 250GB Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2, 1TB Seagate SSHD, 2TB Samsung 860 Evo SSD, 4TB WD Black HDD

Great CPU
","

  Upgraded from an i5 6500 to this i7-10700k and wow has it made a difference. No more stutters in games and a huge FPS gain. Lookup benchmarks for more performance stats.Was originally worried about temps as most reviews said 10th gen Intels are running hot. I have a Noctua NH-U12S cooling this without issues (not overclocked). CPU does heat up immensely in Warzone where a 3-4 hour gaming session has temperatures in the mid 70s c.Pubg, dota 2, and escape from tarkov this CPU only heats up to high 50's to low 60's which is better than I expected. I personally won't overclock this until I invest in a better air cooler or aio. Will update this review as I complete testing and benchmarks.

Nice CPU for the price
","

  If you're able to pick up the CPU for retail price (~$400 USD), this is a great purchase if you do not want to go the AMD route. It's essentially i9 9900k performance for the exact same cost.There were some concerns regarding the idle and under load temperatures, but I have not seen any temperatures above 65C even during continuous stress testing on stock clock speeds.If you DO plan to overclock the CPU, it seems like a no-brainer invest in a better cooling solution (probably AIO with 240 mm radiator) and a motherboard with decent VRMs.

DON'T BUY!!! GOT A FAKE AND HAVE PROOF
","

  First, I was very happy to receive the product. The box seemed normal, sealed, the right text written on the cpu itself, nothing damaged so nothing to be concerned about...at least, in theory.Today, after finally getting the other parts, I started building and...the CPU won't fit the chipset on the z490 motherboard. OK, maybe it was just me, I started a post on Reddit to get help, because at first I always think it's me doing things wrong and double checked everything. I doubted the motherboard, maybe some manufacture error...I would NEVER have imagined buying a FAKE Intel CPU on Amazon, sold and shipped by Amazon itself. Pictures are here as proof, check any image of the genuine one on the net, you will see that the notches position is different and the back of the cpu (with pins) is also different. In mine, the metal is like brushed, different from other intel cpus with a ""granular"" metallic effect. The guy in buildapc subbredit even got the right CPU, it was i9-9940x or any 2066 chipest CPU. And, to make things worse, this FAKE cpu damaged my Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Elite AC chipset, it was a new motherboard purchased with the CPU.Now, after hours and hours of headache with Amazon support, the best I was offered is a refund/return where I am still losing money. So, even when scumming customers by sending them counterfeit products, Amazon still want to make benefit and make the customer (victim is a more suited word since it's a scum) pay for it. I lost something like $40 in the process, great experience. I will update on this when I will really got my money back (the support guy was great but I lost all my trust in Amazon).So, if you are shipping outside the USA, do it at your own risks. Amazon CAN'T be trusted. I am also going to report this to Intel, they have to know that Amazon is selling counterfeit of their products.

Invest in a good cooler.
","

  While a good idea anyway, with many processors now utilizing stock overclocks, you can benefit a performance boost by choosing a better CPU cooler. I went the cheap route, actually, I thought it was middle of the road since the Thermaltake Contac Silent 12 is rated for 150w. I thought I could get away with a $30 cooler since I am not planning on overclocking. That cooler could not even keep up with stock CPU settings. In benchmarks the CPU hit 80-Celsius in seconds and gradually up to 90 where I had it set to throttle. In more practical testing, under basic workloads the temps are more reasonable but the Contac Silent 12 has to ramp up to %100 fan speed frequently to keep that way and it is not quiet at that speed. I know somebody is going to say that's because the default settings on the motherboard are overclocking the CPU beyond Intel's recommended settings. Well, that was one of the first things I checked and that's not the case here. Despite what somebody on YouTube said or didn't say, not all motherboards do that. It is a great processor and complements my workload nicely (no games here). The new cooler is a Reeven Justice, $45 right now. I has the same size 120mm fan however it has six heat pipes instead of four and the tower is about %50 thicker and fins stacked closer together. Temps, while still pretty hot, have come down 8-10 degrees on Cinebench R-20. It still gets up to 80-82 Celsius but instead of hitting 80 right away as it did before, it takes until the render is almost complete and seems to level off there. I feel better about the temps now that It's not riding on the ceiling, especially since all core full load is not a typical workload for me. The fan is much quieter during typical use. I would recommend that cooler for those who are looking for a good compatible cooler.

Performance Beast, Future Proof
","

  I purchased this processor directly from Amazon on May 27th for $387. I've been using it for 1440p 144hz gaming and this processor barely blinks an eye. It has handled anything I can throw at it with complete ease, I'm yet to see it get anywhere near full load. I paired it with a Noctua air cooler and it keeps the chip very cool. My intention in getting this chip is to ""future proof"" my setup as much as possible. I upgraded from a 2500K chip (4 logical cores) I got about 10 years ago, so I want it to last, I really regret not having gotten the 2600K (8 logical cores) at the time that would have lasted me at least a year longer than the 2500K. I fully expect this chips 16 logical cores with very high clockspeed to last quite some time. Very very happy with this chip's performance so far, looking forward to many years of great performance. Intel may not have the best value anymore, but they are reliable and very high performance, which is what I'm looking for. I don't mind paying an extra $100 for a superior chip I'll have for 5-10 years, heck I pay $10 for netflix every month.

Great upgrade from a 6700k

  It feels pretty nice to double my core and thread counts with this CPU from the 6700k. I currently have mine overclocked at 5.2ghz with a push-pull radiator liquid aio system and I'm maxing in the 70s as far as temperature goes. Definitely adds some fps to call of duty and control. I haven't tried red dead or gta v yet, but since they're usually so CPU bottlenecked, I'm sure they'll run great with this.My config in case anyone wanted to know:CPU- 10700kCooler - Corsair H105MB- Gigabyte Aorus Z490Graphics- RTX 2080 SuperRam - 4 x 4gb ddr42 Samsung 860s and 1 M.2 870 (I'd recommend picking up an M.2 if you go with gigabytes now motherboards.. theyre putting 2-4 slots on their MBs now so I feel like it's just untapped potential if you're not going to be using at least one of those slots)Power- EVGA 750w (80+ gold I think?)Case - I did have everything in an NZXT S340, but I just moved it all into that new Corsair mesh case that came out (TD500 Mesh) and airflow and aesthetics are superb.

8 Cores and 16 Threads!!!!
","

  I have been a computer Enthusiast for a while now. I have owned several different platforms including both AMD and INTEL. I upgraded from a i7 7700k. The 7700k’s 4 cores and 8 threads started to show its age with the recent push for higher core counts. I debated getting an AMD 3900x. The appeal of 10 cores and 20 threads was great and but at the sacrifice of core clocks. I am a gamer at heart and do little video/photo editing. The decision was made in my mind and I purchased the 10700k. Out of the box the 10700k boost to 5.1ghz. Yes 5.1ghz insanity. While Intel is still on a 14 nano meter architecture compared to AMD’s 7 Intel has refined the process to undoubtedly still beat AMD in gaming. I have no complaints about the 10700k. It is satisfying to know I won’t need to upgrade for years now.

Easy overclocker
","

  Paired with a ASUS ROG Strix Z490-E Gaming board I was able to easily and quickly achieve a 5.0Ghz all core overclock on air cooling. It's rock solid stable with XMP profile on the RAM and a small cache overclock. This thing absolutely crushes my previous i7-7000k CPU and I noticed a big difference in FPS in quite a few games.I think I may have gotten lucky on the silicon with this chip. I can hit 5.1Ghz stable but it does start to get a little too hot for my comfort, but i actually dont start thermal throttling until I try 5.2Ghz all core. Again, this is just on air using a Noctua DH-D15 so its possible I could do more with an AIO cooler. With enough cooling and time spent tweaking this chip may very well hit 5.2Ghz all core and remain stable. I'll update the review if i ever give that a shot.Its expensive of course.. because it's intel. But if Intel is your jam.. you cant go wrong here.

Cool temps and superb performance.
","

  Don’t let the 125w TDP fool ya because this chip runs WAY cooler than previous gens. Tested temps using OCCT stress test for about 3 hours, alongside my Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The highest I’ve seen the temp spike up to was 71c. Note that OCCT is a heavy synthetic test that pushes the CPU to the limit. Regular gaming temps will never reach that high. I’ve had the chip for almost two months now and accumulated quite a bit of gaming hours during that time. The games I played included a mix of intensive AAA titles like CoD Warzone and AC: Odyssey to light eSport ones such as Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege. Highest temps are always in the 50s to mid 60s range. That is a huge difference compared to my old i5 6600k that spiked to over 80c at times! My brother who bought a 9900k last year was also amazed by how much cooler 10th gen runs and even said that he wished he waited a bit longer before upgrading. Note that both the 9900k and 6600k have lower TDPs than the 10700k yet still run warmer. The reason as to why 10th gen runs cooler is because intel made modifications to the IHS of the cpu and upgraded their Thermal Interface Material. Other then the improvement in the temperature department, I’ve also noticed a big difference in gaming performance. Despite having a 2080 super, my PC used to struggle to reach and stay at a consistent 100+fps at 1080p. CPU intensive games like AC Odyssey often dropped to like 50fps. This is a clear indication that there was bottleneck on the CPU side. With this new 10700k, My PC now has no problems reaching and maintaining that sweet consistent 144+ FPS on light competitive eSport titles and 100+FPS on demanding CPU intensive AAA titles. Also, note that I am running the CPU at stock settings right out the box and have not messed with overclocking yet. Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with this CPU and I highly recommend it.

  Good CPU.  Upgraded from i7 6700k at 4.5Ghz and that one was a hot CPU hitting mid 80s on temp during CINEBENCHR20 while the 10700k I have now at 5.0Ghz has 79C as the highest temp on two cores.  Pretty stable at 5.0Ghz OC but anything past that is a BSOD Zone.  Not too concerned about it seeing where I came from.  The only time i've seen this CPU hit 60C is when it spikes to that point while launching a game.  Other than that, my temps are in the mid 40s to 50s while playing.  It's being cooled by a 360mm Kraken X73 so your temps might vary compared to mine.

This thing is a MONSTER

  I bought this along with the MSI Z490 Unify as an upgrade from my Ryzen 7 3700X. This thing is an absolute monster that runs any game I throw at it at 144fps if my gpu can keep up. It's crazy. People told me I wouldn't see many gains coming from Ryzen but in some of my favorite games I was getting 60%+ higher framerates. Games perform amazingly well and I notice my loading screens all seem about 20% faster than my old chip as well. Everything is just smoother and faster, there's less waiting time, and I didn't have any bios issues or anything at all. Installation was easy. Honestly this is probably overkill unless you have a nice RTX graphics card but it's a wonderful CPU. The temps aren't too crazy with a 280mm aio. I think I'll be happy with this chip for the next 5 years+ at least.

Overclocking is a breeze
","

  I've had my 10700K for about a month now. I paired it with a brand new Asus Maximus XII Extreme and kept my 2080 ROG Strix. The three make a beautiful pairing. If you aren't planning on overclocking, I'll just say, pick this up and you won't regret it. If you aren't speed-chasing, it isn't worth the extra money of going to the 10900K. If you are overclocking, I personally believe the money-performance ratio puts the 10700K on top. But, speed-chasing would suggest picking up the 10900K.As expected, temps are a little hot when overclocking. I used XMP I, clocked to 5.1GHz and left voltage on adaptive. My mobo thinks it's a good idea to stick a whopping 1.545v into it to support 5.1GHz and hit over 100C (exact temp unknown, neither of my monitoring programs read hotter than 100C), but that's totally unnecessary. Dropping down to 1.46v, highest temp spike during stress test hit 90C, not a degree warmer (25min stress test using Cinebench, 360mm ROG AIO). My goal is to hit 5.2GHz this evening. If I have the ability to update reviews, I will post results.Overall, 10/10, strongly recommend. It's a good out-of-the-box processor, and it's fantastic for overclocking, at a price point that doesn't make you want to rip your legs off.

  Intel has been coasting on their Core i3/i5/i7 series for generations. Only after AMD released Ryzen and caught up, did they make some changes. For the first time, an i7 is 8 cores and 16 threads, and can hit a boost of 5.1Ghz. Now, depending on usage, both AMD and Intel are solid choices. I chose Intel again for my 2020 build as I've had a couple issues with AMD in the past and just wanted the fastest single thread processor I could afford.

Probably the Best Gaming Processor
","

  EDIT: This thing is an overclocking beast, but I may have hit the lottery on my chip. I'm currently running a Noctua NH-D15black. I have a 5.1ghz clock and a 47 ring multiplier. This may not seem like much but I'm doing this all at around 1.29Vcore. With this clock and voltage, I run well under 90C under full load, hitting a max of around 83-85C.  DISCLAIMER: IF YOU BUY THIS CPU, OVERRIDE THE VOLTAGE IMMEDIATELY. IT WILL PUMP WAY HIGHER VOLTAGE THAN IS NEEDED AND YOUR TEMPS WILL BE INSANE, ATLEAST IN MY CASE.Alright, for those of you that don't know, this is basically a rehashed 9900k, with slightly higher clock speeds.The way that they were able to achieve the higher clock speeds on a furnace like the 9900k is by doing something called dye shaving. They essentially made the heat spreader on top of the architecture thicker and bigger. This results in lower temps due to the increased ability for the processor to dissipate heat.  In the end you get the best (semi-reasonably priced) gaming processor. The only the one that can beat it right now is the 10900k, but IMO 2 cores for 100 dollars is not worth it if you are just playing games, like most people that buy it. This is in no way a ""bang for the buck"" CPU, but instead for the people that want the absolute TOP OF THE LINE gaming performance. If you want productivity, get a RYZEN CPU. This processor is perfect fine for productivity like video editing and blender etc, but you are not going to get multi threaded performance like AMD offers.  This thing can overclock though, while staying relatively cool. Under a 280mm AIO from NZXT, temps are around 60-70, full load, with a 51 to 52 all core clock. If you can get a good overclock on the cache and main core, it'll be on par or beat the 10900k, but will probably get toasty.  I would definitely recommend this processor, especially if you're looking for a reasonable upgrade from something like a 7700k or 6700k, which just don't compete with anything new nowadays, especially with AMD's competition. Sadly, speaking of competition, INTEL, for now, has lost the war completely with this new generation, only being able to keep the gaming performance better than AMD.SIDE NOTE: DO NOT BUY THIS RIGHT NOW! PC parts are extremely jacked up in price. This thing is going to drop in price 50-75 USD from the standard 425-435.

i7-4790k to i7-10700k
","

  It's a lot better than the 4790k, I wouldn't advise anyone to upgrade to this from the 8700k or 9700k, but it was a major upgrade from what I was using.  I was worried about the temperature of the CPU, but I've overclocked mine to 5.0ghz and I sit under 40 C on idle and 60 during stress-test. (Noctua-D15 is my CPU cooler).  I am very happy with my purchase!

Don't let i7 fool you its a tank and stable overclocker.

  Don't listen to the Ryzen air cooler/aio peasants this chip can do 5.3ghz under 1.4v all day and stay under 70c, Ryzen does a little better in multiform benchmarks yes because it has more cores ect but for gaming its second place. Motherboards right now need better stock voltage optimization that will come with more bios updates so stay away from stock voltage. 5.2ghz can easily be achieved with 1.330v for starters.

Poor performance for your money

  This is getting beat by AMD Ryzen 9 3900X at half the price and even seems to lose to an 8th generation Intel 8700K on single target performance? How can Intel justify these prices.

Very happy
","

  Just came from a i7 6700k at 4.8ghz of 4 years at 1.4v to the i7 10700k and let me tell you. Worth every single penny! I haven’t overclocked the 10700k yet and honestly I don’t need too for 1440p gaming. Bfv isn’t at 100% cpu usage 24/7 anymore. No more micro stuffers in games. Call of duty modern warfare though runs about the same. Slight increase and less studded. But it’s a very optimize game for lower end hardware. Love that all the msi z490 boards are gen 4 but only when you buy the 11th gen processor when it comesout so their is a upgrade path at least. Temps are insanely good. My 6700k at 4.8ghz in game was about 60-70c. My 10700k at 4.8ghz is 40-50c in game. So for clock for clock it’s 20-30c cooler. And that’s with 4 more cores and 8 more threads. Pretty impressed so far. It’ll be years until I’ll need to overclock it for games and I’ll be going 11th gen more than likely for pcie gen 4 before I even get the chance to do it.

  Mine boosts to 5.4 on all cores with air cooling Noctua D15.  Highest temp recorded 83 C under full load. Average temps after 24 hours normal usage (games, web browsing, videos) high 30s.  Idles 29 C.

Well-priced performance CPU - Enable Base Clock Boost
","

  This is an excellent CPU with a great turbo clock speed - just make sure you have something that keeps it cool. I was a little disappointed with the factory base clock speed (3.8 GHz) after it slows down from turbo, but after enabling Base Clock Boost feature on my board, I can run it steady at 4.6 GHz all of the time and it stays nice and cool. It makes for a great gaming/workstation rig.

  I'm hardly a PC expert with a lot of experience to compare this against. But I can say I have this overclocked to 5.1 at 1.335 volts and it's as stable as it gets on my Asrock Z490 Taichi motherboard.

Rebranded i9-9900K
","

  Not much to talk about this CPU...great performance, a rebranded i9-9900K that can clock higher with top tier cooling. Its nice Intel offers all the new 10th gen series with hyperthreading. Now into specifics, if you are worried about thermals, this is the CPU for you, as the i9-10900K can reach 80C even with watercooling (I havent seen any Temps higher than 60C with my i7-10700K). Although games only use at most 6 cores and 12 threads and could benefit with just the i5-10600K, the i7-10700K would benefit many people eager to multitask and stream as well, especially since newer console generation will utilize 8 cores and 16 threads. The i5-10600K is a good budget gaming CPU with the i7-10700K being a top tier gaming and streaming CPU. The i9-10900K is simply overkill and an inconvenience dealing with such high thermals. This gets a 4 stars due to the fact you need to purchase the new Z490 motherboard to use any of the new 10th gen CPUs. Unfortunately for Z370 or Z390 motherboard owners,  you will have to purchase a new motherboard to use a 10th gen CPU. Luckily this doesn't get a 3 star, since 11th gen CPUs will be supported by Z490 motherboards.
