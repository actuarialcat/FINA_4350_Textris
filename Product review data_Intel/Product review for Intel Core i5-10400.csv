20 Year IT Pro Review
","

  To start, I'm not going to hit you with all the spec data. Plenty of sites for that kind of measurement. I'm going to tell you, being a 20 year IT professional, this is a solid processor. I replaced a Xeon E3-1225 with this processor. Even coming from a Xeon for productivity and virtualization, this is a solid upgrade. My system is stable, performs faster, programs execute faster, and my VMs within my labs operate far more efficiently and provide the fast operation requires for a IT professional. If you are considering the 10600, then this is worth the consideration if you're in the productivity space. If you're in the overclock gaming space, then, no, this processor isn't the best option out there. However, it is reasonably priced, has some good mainboard support options, and I even ported over my RAM from my 4+ year old Xeon system without any problems.So, this is not the MOST economic processor. However, its relatively economic, stable, has good hardware support options, and provides a solid improvement over prior generation Intel products. Point is, if you're looking to buy a solid CPU, this is a good bet.If you're looking to overclock the thing into a lava pit in your tower, just go elsewhere and don't give negative reviews when YOU are the one out of spec.

Until the 10600K ACTUALLY becomes available. This is good enough for Gaming
","

  Not the best value out there, but I think it's still a very solid buy if you want it ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY for gaming as I do.About the price, 182 I think it's O.K. Anything more than that it's unacceptable considering the competition.My current CPU is the i5 4670K so, as you can imagine, words cannot describe how much I'm looking forward for my new MoBo to arrive so I can finally complete the upgrade!!Saw some benchmarks and I was very happy with them.Would recommend to anyone buying a new CPU just for gaming and to paired it with a z490 MB. So down the line you actually have an upgrade path as newer GPUs become available.

So far so good

  Great CPU for the $182 I got it for. Huge upgrade from my i7 4770k.

Not a bad CPU.
","

  This CPU is definitely an upgrade from the quad core i7-4770 (non-K) that I previously had! Glad to see the i5 now has hyperthreading, thanks to AMD. But, I may have gotten the worst performing 10400, as my Cinebench R20 and R15 scores are noticeably lower than the benchmarks you'd see online (both single core and multi core and I've got all my drivers/bios installed and up to date). Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase as this CPU is no slouch. Currently have it paired with an Asus Prime B460-Plus and a Zotac GTX 1070. Be aware that there's two versions of the i5-10400. One has G1 stepping (pure 6 core chip and no STIM) and the other has Q0 stepping (10 core chip with 4 cores disabled, uses the newer thermal interface and shares the similar heat spreader from the higher-end unlocked SKUs). Though, the two should perform very similarly.Update 9/9/20: Went to the previous generation platform and currently using an i9-9900K. 10th generation ain't too bad, but it's best to wait on 11th generation Rocket Lake. It's rumored to use a 14nm backport of WIllow Cove... or just wait on Zen 3. For now, I'm waiting to upgrade my 1070 to the new RTX 3080 when it becomes available at my local Best Buy.

Better than expected
","

  Purchased this CPU to get a new system up and running while I wait for the 10900k that I have on back-order. For a relatively inexpensive temporary solution, this isn't a bad processor. It's certainly better than I anticipated.Oh, and, yeah, that's an aquarium the computer is sitting in. It's going to be filled with cooling liquid this weekend after I get the radiator and pump mounted.

Hyper-threading makes up for core count
","

  This was an all-around great CPU even for video editing despite the lack of course the hyper-threading I think really helped out quite a bit

Good Processor!
","

  So far this has been a good purchase for me. I like Intel and I wanted a 10th gen processors. It's okay with my games but to be honest, my decision was price driven. At some point I will upgrade to the i7 10700K. It is just waaaay out of my price range right now!

Solid performance at a reasonable price.
","

  Notably faster than the i7-6700 it replaced plus two more cores for six cores total. Good price. Excellent for someone who does day-to-day stuff on their PC and work mainly in Microsoft Office and other basic apps plus games. Obviously, if you're doing lots of video encoding or apps that benefit from multithreaded tasks, a Ryzen might give you better value for your money. But this is faster in gaming than the Ryzen 3600 and even beats it in some ""productivity benchmarks"" so it was the best processor for my use case: MS office, video conferencing, very light video editing and GAMES. Not overclockable, but that's fine. You can still use fast memory on a z490 motherboard and get notable gains in performance. Low 65w TDP means it runs very cool and can maintain max turbo till the cows come home.

Easy Upgrade for Socket 1200
","

  I bought this to replace with my i3 processor.  Please note that 9-th generation motherboard is NOT compatible with  the 10-th generation processor as the socket has changed.  My desktop computer only has a 200W power supply so a 65W process is perfect for this purpose.  With the 65W consideration, the mid level i5 10400 is around ~180 compared to the entry i3 10100 of ~120, high end i7 10700 ~300+ and i9 10900 ~400+.  The speed improvement certainly worth the extra ~60 dollars without breaking your wallet for the i7 and i9.  The i7 and i9 are certainly great but it may not worth the price given what they are worth.  It may be wiser to spend the extra to invest more into the graphics card instead.

Just what I needed
","

  It is what it is. I’ve never received a flawed intel cpu and I’ve built PCs with them since the 8088. They seem to get easier to install all the time. The notches make it nearly fool proof. I’m not a gamer, I have no need to push the limits. I boot up the new build and it’s been running constantly for 2 wks now without any hiccups. My gen 2 i5 was showing its age, but still runs ok. Just going into retirement I figured I’d build a new desktop while I can afford it. I expect it may be the last pc I’ll need to build since my needs are pretty basic. I probably could have gone with a lower level cpu but I expect this will carry me forward a bit further.

Easy to install in socket. Just read instructions in CPU & MOBO guides.
","

  The CPU is very easy to install since it only fits in one position, because it comes with markings and leads that match the socket on motherboard. So, carefully following  instructions in manual (both motherboard & processor) installation is Easy. I didn't use the stock CPU Cooler that came with the boxed processor; instead I installed a Noctua LH-9x65 CPU Cooler (also relatively easy to install). All in all is easier than older CPU installations. Just follow MOBO & CPU manuals' instructions  and install gently it using the markings and leads on both, CPU & MOBO.

Just okay for light work.
","

  I needed a new build at a time when everything was out of stock, so opted for this i5, which was available immediately, instead of waiting a month for the i7 or the AMD Ryzen 5, which was my first choice.  The specs on this processor seemed to surpass the performance on my i7 4790, but it's not even close. Slow, glitchy, blue screens. To be fair, it's paired with a new mobo, memory, psu, etc., so it may be that there's an incompatibility that pcpartpicker.com didn't anticipate, but given a choice, I would pass on this processor.

I'm an AMD fan, but Intel still has the value
","

  Compared to the direct competitor from AMD, the Ryzen 5 3900, the Intel CPU is $20 cheaper and has a 3% overall more effective speed. Also, the ITX motherboards utilizing the LGA 1200 chipset seemed much better valued as well. I got a ROG Strix motherboard which would've cost $50 more if I wanted it with an AM4 chipset.

Works well
","

  i have this cpu installed on a msi mpg x490 gaming plus motherboard, and when set in bios it will automatically over clock itself. The cpu runs at 2.9GHz, but when i look at my real time monitors it runs mostly at 4.0 GHz Without any issues, and plays every game flawless even demanding PUBG which my older 2.6 i5 3700 had hiccups running.

Good compromise between cost and function

  This processor is not the highest performing.  But that is not what I needed. I want something that is current technology and able to perform reasonably well under an assortment of circumstances.  Since I am not a big gamer this is a very good solution for me.

Bang for your bucks.

  I would say this is the most bang for your bucks in Oct 2020. Gaming-wise, definitely good for 1080p at 144hz pairing up with rtx 1660 super. For people who wants an intel processor for a budget build, this would be it.

  The cpu performed pretty fast stable and solid all around i put it in a asrock z490 phantom gaming itx thunderbolt 3 so i coul put it in turbo mode which is just as good as overclocking to me because you dont have to push extreme power through it and make it heat up just for performance. i see it as the 4.3ghz being the normal speed they just bump it down and add a turbo mode to sell it so its basically doing its job at that speed which means normal temps and power, also it wroks great if you set the ram mhz to the max advertised but not any more or it will become unstable in my expirience.
