The obvious choice
","

  I don't think there's much to say here. The i3 is a fantastic processor that works really well in gaming and even beats the higher core AMD equivalents. It's low power consumption along with it's low heat output definitely makes it the best processor in this price point.

  Wonderful little processor. Tied to a decent GPU and a good amount of RAM this thing will play almost every game at high fps. (Video settings may not be at ultra tho). I play arma, gta, and other games on high graphics settings with great results with this. I have a 1050ti gpu btw.

  Excellent CPU for a good basic, very powerful computer. Couple this up with the Asus B85M-E/CSM and for a pretty low price you will have a very nice computer. Throw in 8 or 16 gig of RAM and an SSD and you will be very happy and not break the bank. This really is a great Proc for a very reasonable price. I have used many dozens of this series and I am very happy with the performance. (I have been building and repairing computers for a living since the mid 90's). If you want to build a computer and are like most people, this is all you will need to do pretty much everything you want a computer to do. If you are a major gamer or want to runs 8000 programs at a time (!), you may need a bit more power but this will most likely do anything else you need it to do.

Ferrari taste, Chevy budget? Check this build out!

  Wow, I was amazed at the performance of this CPU. Seriously...Wow! I have built over a thousand boxes ranging from top shelf gaming rigs, servers to redundant everything servers to entry level work stations and this thing moves data quickly! It is snappy enough for just about anything including current gaming. May lag behind some higher priced processors in high compute mathematical crap (i.e. CAD or serious animation) but most of us don't push our PC's that much. It is just a dual core CPU but does have Hyper Threading (HT) so it is plenty of horse power for 98% of users. This was intended to be a low budget build for just that kind of user. I paired it with a MSI MicroATX Motherboard H81M-E33 which is a serious low budget sub $50 board but with decent sealed capacitors etc., paired with a Samsung 840 SSD (or 850) not sure and Windows 8.1, updated to Windows 10. Just used onboard Intel HD 4400 video and it works great and CAN do a bit of gaming! MB has one PCIe X16 slot if needed. After full install and all standard things installed (Adobe Reader or Foxit, 7zip, MS Office and whatever else) and a check and clean up of any unnecessary startup items, I got about a 7 second boot! Seriously from power on to full Windows desktop in 7 seconds. Best bargain build I have ever done, hands down! FTR, my build and the cost:CPU - this one i3 4160 3.6Ghz$118 (now you can get the 4170 for a dollar more so I would suggest paying the extra buck)Motherboard: MSI H81M-E33$48RAM: 8GB DDR3 (2x4GB) Kingston or Crucial (can't remember)$38240GB Solid State Drive (SSD)$74EVGA 430W PSU$33Basic mid case (Xion or Rosewill)$25Total build cost: $336 assuming you have a valid copy of Windows 7,8 or 10. If someone can show me a better computer (especially custom build) for under $350, I'd like to see it! Add a $100-$200 video card (careful with the PSU!) and you will actually have a nice little gaming beast for a fraction of what anyone would charge.

  First, let me start by saying if you want raw power, virtual machines, CAD performance, or hardcore gaming, you're looking at the wrong processor.  Where this processor excels is performance per watt.  This processor is literally half an i7 with a memory controller and graphics that are slightly slower, but with one major difference: the power consumption (and its less than half the price).  Where most minimalist i7 & i5 builds will consume over 25W at idle, a minimalist build with this processor will consume just over 15W.15.82W nominal use while running vsftpd/apache2/zoneminder and nothing happening with any of those services in my case (measured at the wall).  That's with Corsair 80+ Gold certified PSU, a GIGABYTE z97 mobo (no raid options on, power-saver mode enabled), a Crucial MX100 SSD, GSkill RipjawsX 8 gb (2x4GB @ 1600MHz), CPU fan + 1 case fan (the case fan is at a measly 100 rpm since the system doesn't produce any noticeable heat anyway and CPU fan is on auto) and this processor.  I plan to add a low power HDD for data storage (possibly a WD Green 2TB?) for storage.  Note that the power consumption does increase momentarily when those services are called upon and when the computer is in use.Would I recommend this product? it depends:Home theater PC: yesHome/small office server that needs to be on 24/7: yesWorkstation for student: yes (engineering students that need to be able to do large assemblies may require a better processor)Light gaming/Retro gaming/Emulator gaming: yesVideo (making videos): yes, although you may want a discrete GPU if you're going to be doing a lot of high-def editingHardcore gaming: no (most modern games and PS4/XB1 ports are optimized to run on 4 or more cores, but it's fine for older titles and modern titles that cannot make use of more than ~3 cores as long as you have a decent GPU)Doing CAD: no (while it can easily handle smaller assemblies with a decent amount of ram, advanced assemblies and simulations are the realms of the i7s and Xeons)My build was a home server that needed to run 24/7 and I have not been disappointed.Update 2015.05.05:I have since added an old laptop HDD for storage (~2.5w) and begun running Dovecot 24/7 along with the aforementioned services.  The power use of the system is ~19w at idle and up to ~68w when all services are active, although it quickly returns to the ~19w idle after the job(s) it's doing are done.  The system has not failed or had any errors (as far as I was able to determine) and thanks to a surge-protector+UPS, its been running for over 5000 hours strait (lol).  I have not noticed any change in my power bill since I've started running the server.  I forgot to mention last time, be sure to have a ""Haswell Certified"" (or at least ""Haswell Ready"") PSU to use the enhanced idle states (internally called ""C6 and C7 sleep states"") if you want to run a 24/7 server as they will further decrease the power consumption of the system when it is not in use.Update 2015.05.20:I have seen i3-4170's available at most online retailers now, so I would recommend one of those instead if you can find one for a similar (or better) price.

  The i3-4160 this Dual Core, hyper threading cpu is a solid performer at less than half the price ($120) of it's quad core big brother the i5-4690. However the new fourth generation i5-4690k out performs its older first and some second generation i7 cpu's and is also a terrific bargain at only $229.

Perfect for buget gaming
","

  Works great without a doubt I would recommend this one to people who want to game on a buget just get a powerful gpu like a gtx 960 then upgrade the cpu to a i5 with 4 core later on this i3 will not bottle neck your gaming experience at all.

better CPU for the money than Pentium or Celeron
","

  This processor is a definite improvement over the base-model Intel Pentium-series processor. I originally had a Pentium, but found that some tasks, such as watching HD movies, taxed the cores of that processor. I upgraded to this processor and can run everything without issues. Processes that used to hang and pause, now complete with ease with little or no delay. This is definitely worth the extra money over a Pentium or Celeron.

Great All around Processor
","

  Used this chip to build an all around system for a client.He does a lot of 2D CAD work and since standard autoCAD is mostly single threaded this processor breezes through enerything he has thrown at it thus far.He is actually spoiled for speed now and everything else feels that much slower.His system specs including this processor areMbd: MSI H81M-E34RAM: 8GB Crucial (4gb x 2)Storage: Intel 520 120gb SSD + 2TB WD Red Nas DriveOn chip grapicsNow for the money, i believe that this is one of the best chips. My client tends to have numorous programs running in the background while he works. He also requested speed hence my reason for choosing this chip and using the savings, from not buying a true quad core, and getting an SSD instead. I also avoided the option of getting a G3258 and overclocking cause i was unsure of any stability issues i might encounter. I would also most likely have to spend extra money on cooling if i was going to overclock.He hasn't complained yet so I would say mission accomplished

Main Daily Driver
","

  I've been using this processor for over 3 months now. I must say this is by far the best i3 I've own to date. It's paired with a discrete GPU, an SSD along with ddr3 1600 ram so the overall performance is snappy. I've used it as my main daily driver machine. Was thinking of upgrading this CPU to something higher in the family but now I'm seriously reconsidering.

i3 has got game.
","

  A lot of people underestimate the power of the i3, because it's a dual core. People forget about the ground breaking hyper threading, hey per threading makes SUCH a huge difference in terms of performance. I've used this for gaming and light editing. However I wouldn't try 3D modeling with this guy. Get one of his bigger brothers. Otherwise light to moderate tasks such as gaming, 1080p video encoding, or office work, this CPU is a dominator for the price.

Great cpu.
","

  I have this paired with a gtx 950 / 8gb ram and it can run some pretty intensive stuff. Fallout 4 and 7 days to Die on high-med quality. No issues. This is incredible for the price even using the stock cooler that comes with it, might be able to push it a bit further with a better heatsink and fans.

Best budget CPU in my opinion
","

  Best budget CPU in my opinion. I got this 2 years ago and I'm still able to run games on high settings. Don't be alarmed with it having 2 physical cores. The hyper threading works great. I have a gtx 960 and with this cpu I can run the division on everything high with an avg of 55 fps. If your looking for a budget gaming cpu just get this. Don't even bother with amd. Also runs very efficient and cool. Highly recommended.

Can play any game with great fps. No issues here
","

  Im running the i3 4160 and a msi 970 100me graphics card. 8gb 1600mhz ram. Can play any game with great fps. No issues here. If your building a budget gaming rig, this is a great starting point. Its a fast chip. I've started to out grow it but no regrets. Time to move up to a four core. To me, this chip is still better than most amd chips.

Fast, Cheap, Quite, Great For Budget Build
","

  I've put it in my first PC build, I love it because it is low price but powerful. I've been playing some MMORPG with it and I haven't had a hiccup. This is a very good processor, it runs cool and quite and the fan is decent as well. I recommend it to anyone building with a budget who doesn't want anything older than i3.

Amazing budget gaming performance!
","

  This thing is a budget gamers dream! I am going to recommend this over the AMD 6300-6350 any day of the week, this thing just stomps it in single core tasks, older games that use single core performance, like Project Reality or Command and Conquer. It will run easily Games like battlefield 3 and 4, this thing easily kept up with my Radeon 270x, getting me well over 60FPS on higher settings.IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT ""BOTTLENECKING"", DON'TBottlenecking is like those stupid lies your parents tell you. ""IF you keep making that face its going to stick that way, blah blah blah.""This thing will not bottleneck low-mid range cards, Probably wont bottleneck a GTX 970 in most games. I will test it and let you know.Of course some games will use more CPU power than others, which will slow down your game, but again that's only something you should worry about with the expensive, High-End cards.If you are trying to decide to get this or a 6300 for a budget build, get THIS instead. If you get a decent Socket 1150 Motherboard you can upgrade to an i7 4790k, while an AMD processor with a 970 motherboard or 990fx motherboard will only upgrade to a 8320, which will be a minor upgrade at most.And also people keep saying the 6300 is great at multitasking because its a ""HexaCore"" Well since Its actually a Tri-Core with hyper threading its multitasking is still nothing to write home about as this core i3 can still multitask just as well, probably better actually.For $120 dollars I am extremely pleased with this Processors performance, and if you buy it you will be too.
