Item Did Not Match Description - Arrived without a Cooler
","

  The item description claimed that this would arrive with a CPU Cooler, however it arrived in generic cardboard packaging inside a little bit of protective foam without a cooler. I needed it fast though, so I don't have time to send it back. Guess I'm stuck with it. Maybe this review will be enough to persuade them to provide me with a partial refund. Thanks Intel.

Intel reams you if you want the last generaton of I5 that works with Win7.
","

  We needed one of these for a Win 7 machine that is running custom legacy software.  This is the last of the processor made in the i5 line that will work with Win7 and currently made motherboards, so we had to buy it.  Intel knows this and therefore they charge through the Kazoo for it.

Glad I made the mistake of buying it on accident.
","

  I was annoyed at my own mistake of buying the wrong i5 chip. I thought I bought the K and was psyched that I got it for so cheap. Then I realized I got a cheaper one.I was down on that at first, then I started playing some graphic intensive games and the PC was totally fine. Now I'm happy I made the mistake because I don't need the 7700k or the 6700k. This works just as well and I'm not video editing.

It's working.
","

  I used this Core i5 processor to upgrade my HP Omen 870-210 from an outdated dual core i3 processor, and it works great. The only issue I really had was attempting to install the stock fan. It came with some weird plastic snap in screws that I couldn't manage to figure out. There is a small manual but it's just pictures with very little explanation, so I used a different fan and heat sink. I'd recommend buying a separate fan for this one. It's running great though. I couldn't be happier.

Great choice for low cost PC Gaming..... but it's faster than we thought it would be!
","

  I have a customer who needed a new PC for his son to play video games. He was on a budget so we decided to go with this i5-7400. Well it turned out to be a good choice and with the Sapphire Pulse GPU (graphics card) his son is getting 76 FPS with Shadow of the Tomb Raider. He's happy!!

Great Process
","

  It's a great i5 processor that is easy on the wallet but offers the best bang for the buck in my opinion and is a must if you are using a graphics card in the GTX 1070 and above range. Anything less and you really start to bottleneck the graphics card.

Not as Described ""3.5GHZ"" Not Base
","

  I placed an order for product ""BX80677I57400 "" which is advertised as a 3.5GHZ processor. I returned the original received as it was marked as a 3.0GHZ. The replacement was also a 3.0GHZ. The item is incorrectly labeled as a 3.5GHZ when it is in fact a 3.0 with turbo. This is not as advertised and for those placing orders you will want to check into this to be sure you want this product before placing the order. 99% of processors on the market are posted as base clock speeds and it is a bit shady this would be listed at the turbo speed.This has caused a lot of frustration as I have now had to return two products and will not get the refund until the 2nd is received delaying my PC from being completed. This information is important for those building specific types of PCs and really should be noted in the products description.
