Such a waste of money and time. It didn't even work.
","

  My son asked me last month if he could get a new processor for his birthday (May 27).  I told him that if I bought him one, that it would be his only present because of how expensive it was. He said he was ok with just opening 1 gift (mind you, he just turned 12). So after a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the Intel 7 was the best processor for his PC. I ordered the item on May 13 and received it a couple days later. I didn't open the amazon box because I already knew what was in it. On May 27, 2019, my 12 year old son opened his only gift. To my surprise, the processor wasn't in the Intel 7 box that is shown in the description. Instead the processor was wrapped in brown paper. No instruction, no serial number, no fan, nothing. But I didn't really care about the fan because I had already purchased a better one. So, giving the product/company the benefit of the doubt, I installed the processor I ordered into my son's PC. And what should happen, nothing. I spent the rest of the evening researching why the processor wasn't working in his PC. But I didn't find anything on line that had the same problem as I was having. So, I decided to update the BIOS thinking that would make a difference, but it didn't. I even called my friend (who builds computers) to come look at it. After spending the evening researching, he said that everything was compatable and that there shouldn't be any reason the new processor shouldn't work, UNLESS there was something already wrong with the processor that I bought. He then recommended that I return it. I just filed a return claim. So now I'll wait and see if they will refund my money.

Doesn't work
","

  Wasn't expecting it to be a new chip but it was so polished that I can barely read the Intel 6700K logo. Can't test myself because I don't have another compatible board. Spent money to have a computer repair center test it and my ASUS ROG B150 Pro Gaming Aura motherboard, and another fee from Asus for an RMA on the board (haven't sent it in yet). The store says it is defective. Seller insists we're incompetent, me for ordering the incorrect CPU, and the store for failing to test it correctly. Although I bought the exact same CPU as the one that doesn't work. It is Skylake CPU for intel LGA 1151 socket, which replaces one that worked for years and stopped so I replace it with one from the seller. The problem: Nothing appears on screen but there's no CPU error light, just fan spins and board lights up. Buying this item from Amazon meant waiting a weeks for the package to clear through customs, then a surprise 70 customs fee, then diagnostics fees, all before contacting the sellers. So that's almost 500$ wasted on a metal stamp, most of which are fees that the seller isn't liable for and won't refund anyway. Then being insulted by the seller on top of it. My only option is seeking another computer store to test the CPU I bought AND my old one so the seller will be satisfied and will hopefully honor refund requested through Amazon, but that's going to cost another 70 diagnostic fee.

Intel is outperforming AMDs
","

  Since 2003, I had AMD processors, I had the one core I remember at that time hahaha, my current HP Desktop has a AMD Phenom II X4 2.90 GHz, I bought an AMD FX 8350 but unfortunately the one I've got and the replacement were dead on arrival. I also was disappointed with AMD products because the FX series come with a ridiculous, small stock fan, smaller than my AMD described above. When I saw this Intel i7 6700K, I was excited, I just purchased it, arrived in perfect condition.I already tested and my PC that I am already building runs very fast in all aspects, I know Intel is expense than AMD but it is worth it to buy them, they are very good quality, they don't run very hot when you overclock them, AMD is way behind than Intel, they have the same architecture form several years, there is nothing new, I am sorry but I want something that lasts several years without having issues with hardware. Intel is always improving their products, their technology is way superior that AMD, it just outperform AMDs.When you see a processor, don't just consider their cores and the speed, they are several things to consider about the processor's speed, like BUS SPEED for example and other important factors. Extremely satisfied with this processor. I love gaming so I don't want any lag at all.

  OK everyone, so here's the deal:This is an absolutely fantastic processor! I am upgrading my 6 year old computer (Intel Core2Quad Q9550) to this beast and let me tell you, I don't care what people are saying about Skylake this, Skylake that, it's amazing! Now, please, do yourself a favor, and if you're going to spend this kind of money on a component, have the decency of purchasing a Corsair H115i water cooler as well! On my first build I had used air cooling for the first 1 and a half or so, then I discovered Corsair water cooler (at the time I purchased the H55) and it's been wonders ever since. I was running Far cry 3 last night with this thing (stock mind you) on Ultra settings with a EVGA GTX 960 FTW edition, and was hitting 60 FPS stable at all times. (dropping to 59 or 58). Temps were 44 C - 50 C. IT wouldn't go past that while gaming. Fantastic product! Just buy it already! :)

  You can simply overclock this to 4.6 right out of the box in the motherboard without tweaking any voltage. And still runs relatively cool. (I use a Noctua heatsink fan)This was a huge improvement over my previous CPU (Phenom IIx4 BE), I notice much less jitters in graphics when in dense gameplay particles. Great buy. Unfortunately, after buying this, the next week Kabylake dropped. I'm very bad at checking when the next thing is going to be out, I would've waited. But honestly, after reviews on Kabylake, there's very little differences in performance.Running simulations is also a breeze. Takes a few seconds instead of minutes on my last CPU.

  Either this allowed to pins to arc or i got two faulty boards. I'm unsure of what caused this to not work with two different setups. Decided to go with a amd board and chip and I'm up and running now. 3 stars since i never tested the chip with a third board i knew worked so it wouldn't be fair to rate 1 star. On the other hand, it didn't work for some reason and the seller never reached out until the refund went through to help resolve the issue so definitely not 5 stars. Especially since they didn't know a cpu could cause pins to arc if either installed incorrectly or its faulty.

  This is my first build with Intel, I have usually been and AMD guy.  I went from the ground up on this new build, my old machine had 5-10 year old component's and my newer games were struggling.

4.8Ghz out-of-the box, just install it with any Z170 Motherboard

  Whoa.  4.8Ghz out of the box?  Yep.  With literally one setting in the BIOS of the 

Gigabyte LGA1151 Intel Z170 2-Way SLI ATX DDR4 Motherboards GA-Z170X-Gaming 7

   .  No need to guess if you've hit the CPU lottery or not.  It overclocked out of the box, literally one setting, 2 seconds of work, and I have a near 5Ghz system.  More tweaking and this could substantially be even faster, but I'm happy with 4.8Ghz , 32 centigrade.  A+ Intel, great job on this one.  For buyers out there, even if you don't plan on overclocking right away (though you wouldn't probably be looking here if you weren't) make sure at least you get an Z170 motherboard from any manufacturer.  That's the Intel Chipset that lets you go way wild with getting the maximum amount of torque from these i7s.Note: I did buy a watercooler ( 

Corsair Hydro Series H115i Extreme Performance Liquid CPU Cooler , Black

   ) for the CPU.  That does help, and it's not difficult to install at all.. if you are deciding between using a fan and a watercooler, I would go for the watercooler simply because you have a lot more benefit that you can get out of this CPU without having to worry about heat throttling.  Again, they are easy to install, and I'm impatient so I'm not one to mess with a lot of ""extras"" on an install, so they are well worth it.

  This processor is amazing right out of the box. I have it currently at factory default and under a custom watercooling loop on a Asus MAXIMUS VIII GENE.

  If you really want something overpowered in your PC, get this cpu it gets the job done no sweat. It is very easy to overclock though it works great in its base clock speed. This cpu usage normally stays below 50% even in high demanding applications, meaning it is performing flawless. Only thing i advise, if you're going to overclock i'd recommend a liquid cooler, Heatsinks don't do great job cooling when going for high clock rates and temperatures often spike high between low, so go for liquid cooling, besides you'll have more space in your case for applying fans on side panel of case for example.

Great processor for moderate development and gaming

  This is a great processor. I am a Software Engineer, but I also like to game on my free time, and this processor handles both at a 13% overclock with only a CoolerMaster Hyper 212 Evo to cool it and never getting temps higher than 70 C. (You will obviously need a better cooling solution at higher clock speeds, though I don't feel I need any higher of a clock speed as I have plenty of power atm).This is NOT, however, a good buy for a builder who is just looking to game, in my opinion. The i5 6600K is a great processor, and for even high end gaming, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the two as a majority of modern games are mainly GPU intensive. The i5 is not only over $100 cheaper, but its in stock more often. But that's just the opinion of a software engineer, so take it as you will.Overall, I love it and it was worth every penny.

  Put this on my wishlist years ago when Intel was still the front runner on cpus and bought a supporting mother board early on in my planning. This locked me into the Intel chipset when I finally bought it this year. While it does great while multitasking - under load it does run hot and having to buy your own cooling unit is a huge downside.

Quality and a Beast of Processing Power
","

  Brilliant product form Intel again. Runs so smoothly on my Asus Z170 Deluxe mobo. The configurable parameters available allow you to specify many specific operating regions. The CPU does not need to be clocked full all the time, it is very efficient w.r.t energy, you never notice any lagging on the PC even with gaming when you let the CPU adjust the performance and speed as required.New chips were a bit interesting during installation as they do not have pins anymore. The power usage for my Asus Z170 Deluxe, Intel i7 6700k and RX 480 operate in normal conditions at approximately 240 watts. So much for having a 850+ Watt PSU these days.

Worth more than every penny!

  I purchased this CPU as it was the correct one for me based on my wanting the most powerful Intel CPU at the time that supports all of the modern functions like USB 3.1 etc. the product itself is amazing, performance is great!  I'm a streamer so my CPUs get tested quite severely and this one does an amazing job rendering max settings at very high stream quality on the most graphics intensive games. The only gripe I have is that I ended up having to pay around $150 more than its actual Intel set price due to extremely limited availability and a time crunch not allowing for me to wait for a better price. I will not however drop any stars due to that however as that has nothing to do with the product itself and is simply natural market forces. Can't complain.

  Seriously, this is one hell of a fast processor. Anyone buying an i7 should know that this processor will literally do anything you can throw at it. With the exception of the HEDT processors, this is the go to i7 that everyone should consider before actually moving to the HEDT product line (High-End Processor Line). Please note that the i7-6700K is still a relatively hot chip, especially compared to it's smaller sibling, the i5-6600K. Keep that in mind when you observe the temperatures because the i7-6700K is seeing temperatures about 15C higher than the i5-6600K.

Set to 1.30 V Adaptive for a long term overclock just to ensure stability and a month in have had no crashes or other funny business, seems a nice safe voltage to get a significant performance boost over stock. Could not get it to 4.8 GHZ however (tried up to 1.45 V, which is higher than I like to push the voltage) -- it was like hitting a wall after 4.7 and simply could not go higher.

High performance and Satisfaction

  Upgraded from my worn out FX 6300 to this beast processor, and I have to say it was worth every penny. I can see significant performance boost with only just the stock setting. Overclocking it would give even more power. Pair this processor with the z170 motherboard, along with the Cooler Master Hype 212 Evo and it is running cool and smoothly.For gamer or graphic designers, this processor will get the job done excellently. Comparing with the new i7 chipsets, this one doesn't lose out too much, and for the price/performance ratio, this is the best deal you can get. Not too pricey but delivers excellent performance.I use this processor with a GTX 660, and can get 80+ FPS easily in most games running in 1080p.Overall, I have no regrets upgrading to this processor. This will keep me up and running for another few years at least.

Avid gamer giving up AMD.
","

  Switched to this from an AMD 6350 overclocked to 4.5GHz and even at a stock clock, this processor smashes my old one.  I bled AMD for so long, but their performance is just garbage, and considering if I had upgraded to a new AMD chip, I would have had to build a whole new system from the start.  I decided on Intel this time, and I picked this up for under 300 (I knew the 7700K's were coming within a month) this chip was still so much an upgrade.  I played around with overclocking a little bit and I can hit 4.3GHz stable without changing voltage, but I'll save that for a quick, free upgrade later.My old processors would cause random stuttering and unsteady frame rates, moving to this fixed my issue.  There are still drops, but they aren't as dramatic and not as frequent.*update* Months later, this is still going great.  AMD has released their Ryzen chips, and for $100 more than what I paid for this, the 1800x would give me approximately 0.1% increase overall.  The Ryzen 1800x is a 8 core 16 thread processor, but if you're gaming, the higher clock speed matters a little more.  If you want the newest equivalent of this chip, the 7700K is currently about Three hundred and offers roughly an 11% increase over the 1800x, for a hundred bucks less. Information taken from userbenchmark dot com.  For gaming, higher clock speeds win, for multi-threaded tasking and server management, more cores and threads can help.  I still have plenty of room to overclock this chip in the future, and I can gain the ground lost by the newest generation of processors for a few years in doing so.  Otherwise, grab a 7700k unless AMDs prices drop significantly or you want to host a mini-server.

I would recommenced as best consumer CPU Its the fastest and has just the right amount of cores.
","

  I compare this to my i5 K series that I OC to 4 to 4.2Ghz. Its a lot snappier and i do multitask aloy. This will show up as 8 cores because its 4 true cores with HT (Hyper Threading) meaning 4 logical cores in addition.So can process 2 threads of information per clock cycle per core so OS will see 8 cores for those who are not familiar.Everything is faster opening and switching programs games are amazingly faster was surprised how much better they ran maxed out with this chip. But also this makes the jump to DDR4 so memory has been tremendously improved stock memory is 2.2Ghz to 2.4Ghz.I'm running 3.2Ghz Corsair Dominator Memory with my i7 6700K Skylake at 4.5Ghz and I know I can go faster with just default over clocks in BIOS and running a Corsair H115i water 280mm Radiator with only 2 fans pushing cold air in (I usually do a push pull) with average temps of only 24c on quit lowest fan settings.I could easly hit 5Ghz but one I havent found the need to and my PC is prity quite as is. with fans turned up I managed 17c  witch is lower then the any air cooler and that's still OCed and silent so cant beat that.Bottom line its worth the extra $100 to step up to an i7K Faster then any of the Brodwell-E class CPU's that are $500+ X-99v3 chipsets only has more PCI lanes that 98% people will never use.I would recommenced as best consumer CPU Its the fastest and has just the right amount of cores.You would be hard pressed to find any one program that could use all 8 threads at once let alone 16Gb of memory.Anything that you could buy above this is stricktly for bragging rights as there is nothing out there that will bottneck this CPU unless you have unlimited money and can run 3 or 4 1080's or NVM U.2 Drives witch use up 4 PCI-E Lanes per drive

  I build computers for a living.  Having said that, newer doesn't always mean better.  I keep 3 computers, all 3 very high end builds and sell the rest.  There's a lot of interest in the 1151 chips.  Super.  I have one of these to go with my i7-4790k and my i7-5930k.  There is SO little real world difference that one can only go by specs.  If I wanted (and had 2 more workshops), I'd build a Xeon machine for each real world use...not gonna happen.  This 6700K runs the coolest consistently of all 3 (same cooler, same voltages, exact same full tower cases and all on $300+ Asus comparable boards.  As hard as I can push them, I run about 4 deg Celsius cooler with this one.  The only one I STILL give 5 stars to is the 4790K.  Each does something a little different, but only God can tell what by using them all (although the 5930K eats video editing UP, it also costs $500+).  Day to day, hard core gaming, heavy MS Office or just watching videos I'd be more than satisfied with all 3, this one very much included.

  I paid $60 more than today's price, so I feel a little dumb, but does that detract from my complete awe of this processor?  Nope!As others have stated, it's fast and it's cool.  I'm using a Noctua NH-H12S air cooler and the i7 6700k idles at 25 degrees C and peaks under heavy load at 55 degrees C.  Oh, and it's oc'd to 4.6 gHz!  The fan hasn't budged from 800 RPM once. This proc absolutely screams when moving files, loading games,editing video, etc.  I can't give a definitive description of how it runs my DCS A-10C flight simulator because the cord that came with the Radeon R9 290 GPU is too short and I'm running off the Intel 530 integrated graphics right now; that's not cutting it beyond 14 fps (which is still pretty good for onboard video).Now that prices have come down there's absolutely no reason not to get this chip if you're upgrading from 2 generations ago or more (mine was 4.5 y.o.!).  Against a Haswell, maybe not, but it kicks butt across any other line you'd care to draw.Rest of rig:NZXT H630 Tower with 3x200mm and 3x120mm fansGigabyte Z170XP SLI moboCrucial Ballistix 2400 DDR4 RAMSamsung M.2 512GB SSDWD Red Pro 2TB HDDWin 7 64 bit

This processor handles all my needs well; whether it be surfing the internet, video or photo editing, to intensive gaming. One thing to note however, is that if you are not planning on doing any CPU intensive activities on your computer or on a tighter budget, go with a more economical i5 Skylake processor.

  Great processor. Easily overclocked it to 4.6GHz with no issues. Its been running great since I built my new machine a few months ago. It's great for gaming since clock speed is most important and this overclocks pretty high with ease. Most games aren't able to take advantage of multiple cores, so your fastest clock speed with suit you best for gaming than having more cores. It is a good all-around processor as well for your typical work loads. I can do video editing easily with what I have, so i don't think you need anything more than this unless you are an actual professional video editor who needs an 8 core processor.

  06/18/2016..  Only the best for my new mobo system09/09/2016.  This unit went bad and was replaced by Intel.  It's a complex process but follow their guidance and they do replace defective units. Just got the replacement and will try again.  Had to have ASUS test the mobo to prove the CPU was defective. ASUS tested the mobo and returned it to me as it was good.  I installed the new CPU and it boots fine.  I configured the systems it is running well.  It's been four months.  I will still use Intel.

  I like the fact that this didn't come with a stock cooler, since I have about 3 I'm using as doorstops right now (side note, the pegs on those stock coolers dig into carpet quite nicely. They can hold a door open during gale force winds, I swear). I was able to overclock this thing to 4.7 GHz with my memory at 3000 MHz easily. When doing idling, it dips down to 800 MHz to save on power, which allows my computer to be dead silent.

  I got this cpu on sale for $300 and love the upgrade. Did a review on it as well. A decent overclocker extremely good on single threaded performance, so it's a beast in gaming, and not too shabby for light editing work. The 7700k only has a %5 performance boost; about 4-7 fps difference on average. The only difference is the 7700k overclocks like a porsche. They are pretty much the same so you mine as well go with the 7700k for the extra 4k feature support, but if you get the 6700k you won't be dissapointed

  rock solid. I started out building an amd build and I seriously ran into so many problems. Motherboards that needed bios upgrades to be able to work with octacore amd processors, purchasing cheaper amd processors just to boot up and upgrade bios..  In the process of trouble shooting I had the bright idea of buying a quad core intel along with a moderately priced motherboard and my trouble shooting came to a screeching halt.. what followed was gaming on max settings (saphire r9 390) and problem free computer using. Type this processor model into some bench chart sites; it's not the greatest out there but its an awesome bang for your hard earned dollars.

Even with hours of Prime95 on air cooling in a closed-space, never hit a PROCHOT or approached close to it.

Best overclocking i7 ive ever owned

  I got a good chip. This is replacing my i7 5820k/X99 system. This i7 will do 4.8ghz for me on my open loop. And at this speed its already faster then my x99. It also boots way faster. I carried over my Gtx 1080 and 950 pro m.2 and its moving along using almost 100 watts less then the x99. If you can get lucky and find a chip that will oc past 4.5 its a better deal then x99 for me. I sold that system cause it power hungry and puts off hella heat.

Intel a good buy coming from being dedicted to AMD
","

  Overall this was not a hard installation. Be warned that if you are replacing your Processor and Motherboard, you may need to get new software licenses for many product suites as this is considered to be a brand new PC even though you may reuse your HDD/SD/RAM... I personally went from an AMD to Intel in this rebuild using same case. I had issues with my old AMD process due to downgrading my system from watercooling to air cooling because of corrosion. After taking off all of my blocks and reseating the processor, many pins bent and I've suffered constant OS locking and random rebooting. Be sure to get a decent fan as this comes without one. I had some fans from old builds that did not fit this brand/model. I ended up going to MicroCenter to buy a $10 air cooler which did the job perfectly. Without additional overclocking, my system says the heat stays at around 32-35 degrees C.

  I love this CPU....its fast and decent. I have never owned an unlocked processor before. But I like it just the way it is - coming from a Core 2 Duo E7500 with 8 GB RAM and the ASUS HD 7970 Direct CU II DX 11.2 until October 2015. I did play all the fps games up until Watch Dogs couldn't run or did run but with a few BSODs and then I waited for a while looking for the right deal and the best hardware. After reading several hundreds of reviews and techno babble, I settled for the latest hardware after reading a review from PC Gamer - ""i7-6700K turned in gaming benchmark frame rates only a few frames faster (and sometimes slower) than the older CPU i7-4790K Devils Canyon. It’s not a huge flashy upgrade, but it brings with it a new socket and a new chipset, Z170 and the next Gen RAM - DDR4"".My Specs today, 20 November 2015Z170 ASUS Pro GamingIntel i7-6700 KWindows 7 Pro x64Crucial 32GB Kit (8GBx4) DDR4-2133 (No need for XMP profile)ASUS HD7970-DC2-3GD5Samsung 850 EVO 250GB (For OS only)WD 500 GB SATA (For Gaming)HLDS GH70N SATA DVD Drive ( from a spare parts only - Dell Optiplex 990) This component is a life saver.Corsair RM850 for good powerNoctua NH-D14Everything above is Amazonian Hardware (except for the DVD Drive & the CPU Cooler)..A Big Thanks to Amazon !!! for the recommendations, delivery and Peace of Mind !!!

Great if you get a good one

  Not bad. I don't think I lucked out, I got a unit with one core (core 2) that gets significantly hotter than the others, even with water-cooling, full fan RPM and Arctic MX-2 applied. Not stable at BCLK 103.0 and 46 multiplier unless full voltage of 1.45 is applied. Runs good at 4500 GHz, but disappointed because of the disproportionately hot Core 2, which is often 10-15 degrees hotter than all other cores at all times. would be 5/5 if you get a good one.

  All I can say this paired with anything greater than or equal to a GTX 970. You are not going to have a bottleneck on your computer. I can run any game maxed out with 1080p/2k monitors and always get at least ~45 fps on the most demanding of games. i.e. BDO, Skyrim with Shaders and Texture mods, etc. I was just a little dissapointed when it went from $420, the price I bought it at to $230 RIGHT after I bought it..

  Intel has done it again by bringing us one of the best CPUs on the market: the i7-6700K! For price to performance, this tops even its cousin the i5-6600K! The base speed at a whopping 4Ghz makes it possible to tear through most anything thrown at it, especially when paired with an excellent motherboard and GPU. What's even better is the ability to overclock it to 4.6Ghz for unparalleled speed and performance. I have nothing more to say, except keep it going Intel!

Staggering performance, amazing specs.  For the price this beast is the best you can get.  You won't regret it.
","

  For the price you cannot go wrong with this.  The only issue that I found was that the number of PCIe lanes described in the documentation for this CPU was not enough for what I wanted.  The specs say it has 16 lanes, but my video card alone needs 16 lanes. Plus I have an M.2 hard drive that needs 4.  I almost didn't buy it, and went with a different CPU and motherboard.  But, I did some more research and found that these are just the lanes in the CPU, and the bridge chip has its own lanes.  These lanes are really intended for the graphics card only.  So, if you look how the motherboard is setup, these 16 lanes go to the first x16 slot intended for a video card.  That is how mine is.  Then the skylake chipset that is paired with this CPU has 20 more lanes.  That is enough for another x16 card, and a x4 M.2 hard drive or whatever.  So, you actually end up with 36 lanes of PCIe between the two. Once I saw that, there was no question this is for me.It is a 14nm process, which is one of the newer processes, and it runs at 4Ghz,  The CPU is unlocked, so you can overclock if you want.  I put on a water cooler and just did some brief checks with OC, and I ran at 4.5Ghz without issue.  However, I really don't need it and I don't want to risk burning it out fast, so I put it back to 4Ghz for now.  But, I know I can run much faster in the future if I want to.As for specs and performance, this is a middle of the road 4 core, 8 thread CPU.  It has the memory controller built in, supporting DDR4 memory, which is what I use, and the performance is just staggering.  >34GB/s of memory throughput, that's wild.The CPU has 8MB of smartcache that is shared amongst the cores.  This is much better than normal cache, it allows a program in cache to be shared with another core, when the thread jumps to a new core, without copying the data to another location in cache.  The performance increase of this small feature is quite large.  The CPU has a decent video card built in, but I don't use it.  I opted for the Nvidia GTX1080.  Combining this CPU with that graphics card, M.2 drive, and DDR4 memory makes this a powerhouse that can stand its own against basically anything.  However, the built in graphics do support 4K resolutions, so if you are not playing cutting edge games, or VR, the graphics card built in is probably all you would ever need.Without going into the technical specifics of this CPU, it basically has all the features that you would expect from any i7 CPU.  The price, for what you get, is really unbeatable.  You can get an i7 with more cores, or cache, but you will pay a large amount more.  For 99.99% of people out there this is more than you will need.  There is nothing you will get from the CPUs that are 2X+ the price that you will even notice.  Just make sure you pair this with a good chipset, like the Z170, and never look back, you will run so fast you won't believe it.My PC runs windows 10.  From the time the BIOS screen disappears to when it needs my password is about 3.5 seconds.  From hitting enter after my password until the machine is fully booted, and I have full control, no hourglass, etc, is about 2-2.5 seconds.  So, I boot in under 6 seconds, basically.  That is a full cold boot, not a resume from sleep.Pros: 4Ghz, unlocked and ready for overclocking (use a water cooler if you overclock this bad-boy).  4K graphics built in.  16 lanes of PCIe on board for fast access to the video card.  20 more lanes of PCIe on the chipset, so you can have another 16x video card, and a M.2 x4 drive, or whatever else you might want.  New generation cache speeds up thread jumping from core to core.  DDR4 memory controller with >34GB/s throughput.  The biggest PRO is the price, for what you get.Cons: Would have been nice to have 12MB or more of cache, but the cost would have been significantly more.  For the price, there is really no downside to this CPU.

Great chip, and a huge improvement if it's been a while since you've upgraded
","

  It's been several years since I upgraded, and this chip was a great improvement over the i7 960 I had. Of course this purchase required a new motherboard and memory, since it uses DDR5 and the slot is a different architecture. I've noticed that processor intensive operations like rendering videos has greatly improved. Simple videos with a few tracks renders in almost real-time with this processor. Games that also use the CPU run smooth as silk. Granted these are older games, but the fact they don't take much advantage of any GPU features really showcases this chip's capabilities.

OEM parts means OEM tray version, no retail box.
","

  I received this in a tiny box size as a ring box. The cpu is in a cpu tray that is the same as the tray you will find inside the retail version, besides that, they(the seller or their vender) seal it with shrink wrap. It's my fault that I didn't know OEM part means OEM tray version, not retail box, I used to use and see people use ""tray"", at least other seller would say something like ""no retail box"". But anyway, I had terrible experience with tray ones before from other vender. So I ended up return this one.  I didn't actually open the wrap. It's surprisingly to get an email from the seller in Sunday morning. I gave it 5 star since I don't have reason to minus one.

Wait for the price to drop or use Price Protection

  I bought this processor about a month ago, and so far no issues. It's overpriced currently, but I plan on using my credit card's Price Protection feature to get a partial refund when the price of this processor drops back down towards the MSRP in a few months.I currently use a CoolerMaster D92 to cool this processor. I have the processor at 1.200V and 4.2GHz with no issues. My temperatures rarely get over 50°C unless I'm benchmarking. During RealBench testing, the CPU gets up to around 70°C, which is still pretty comfortable for a CPU under high loads.

This CPU out performs my 2600K by leaps and bounds, solid 144 fps in GTAV, Tomb Raider, and Crysis 3.

Otherwise I would recommend getting this for one of the three following reasons
","

  So. I was able to snag one right when Amazon put there pre-order up and I got it for retail price. That being said guys. I really wouldn't consider buying this until the prices get sub $400 at least. You all know the performance benchmarks on this thing. It's about 5-10% faster on synthetic tests and in games it produced maybe 1-3 extra fps.Otherwise I would recommend getting this for one of the three following reasons.If your going all out on your first build, this isn't a bad choice since all in all the cpu and new motherboards/ram will only cost about an extra 50-100 dollars (if you can get a retail priced cpu right now). And will future proof youIf your doing a completely new upgrade. Again, go with this since its ""future proofing"" you. The future of PC's has become one with ddr4 memory. So if you want to be able to upgrade to whatever comes out ram/cpu wise in the future, you better have a z170 board.And otherwise, if your a perfectionist...... Also, supposedly this cpu is a beast at overclocks. So there's that too.Otherwise I'd say it's not really worth it. Maybe if you have a really old cpu then perhaps. But otherwise you might as well wait until the next generation processor that's supposed to come out in a year or so.

It runs about 60 to 80 watts when I do audio/video editing - and it finishes my audio edit benchmark in less than half the time it takes the AMD/64 8 core 4.0 Ghz system it is replacing.

  Second i7-6700K that I've bought.  Not sure why the first one died, but I suspect that it was heat (apartment routinely reaches 86F in the afternoons and I lack A/C) and after 18 months, it ended up Blue-Screening and wouldn't boot my OS anymore (it would still POST and go to BIOS/UEFI, though).  Perhaps I simply didn't get lucky with the Silicon Lottery, so to speak.  So here I am typing on the desktop again with a replacement 6700K (I got by using a G4400 Pentium, which is also a Skylake chip) slotted into a better case and a more robust AIO cooler (larger radiator, more fans).  Finally!  I can properly enjoy my games again!

  By far the best processor I have ever built with.  Not only is i7 leaps and bounds above AMD with instructions/clock and single-threaded performance, but their energy efficiency and low voltage demand make them perfect for overclocking!  Do NOT abuse this amazing CPU with an air cooler – you'll be very happy you chose water cooling.With my Corsair H105 cooler, I managed to clock all cores at 5.0GHz with +220-250mV offset, and run the benchmark you see attatched.  Temps run in the low-mid 70s C under full load @ 5.0GHz.  It handled a 20-minute stress test without crashing, so I consider it decently stable at this freqency, although more abusive testing may be needed to confirm a 100% stable voltage.I was able to achieve and run some tests at 5.07 GHz, but stability isn't great, and 5.10 GHz runs into current limits on my motherboard that I haven't found out how to disable (or whether it's even safe) to push this thing harder.  Either way, this is an insane performance processor for the price and power consumption, and I highly recommend anyone with an AMD build or Sandy/Ivy Bridge build to consider a Skylake i7 upgrade.

Best CPU I've ever owned
","

  This was the replacement for my old i5-3570K rig. The last time I had an 8 threaded processor was way back with the first generation of i7 chips with the i7-960; boy is it good to be back. Out of the box the processor is clocked at 4GHz but after five minutes I had it running at 4.8GHz. This is the easiest overclock-able processor I've ever owned. It sips on power (I've only got 1.3V on the core and I am sure I can get it lower) and on an H100i V2 under synthetic load the max temperature after 30 minutes straight was 58C. Every single thing I threw at this processor was creamed. The most intense gaming loads were like child's play never breaking 50% utilization with Firefox open in the background playing Youtube videos. It was a night and day difference coming from the old 3570K. Most definitely the best processor I've ever owned and certainly the fastest. A+

  Love it so far; didn't gain much against a 2 year old i5 K series; regarding games performances, but on professional applications, like video editing and 3D, you can tell the difference very easily.IF you are a gamer, save the money and get an i5; otherwise if you use your computer for gaming and other applications, then this is the one that you want.

What sort of info is useful in an amazon review of a CPU
","

  What sort of info is useful in an amazon review of a CPU? If you're buying this you probably know what you're getting, I'll just mention that I was surprised at how much more often the CPU is able to go into a low power state by underclocking or whatever fancy techniques Intel uses nowadays.Coming from a i5 2500k it's amazing how much better they are about this, when you're putzing around the desktop/browser while mostly idle the CPU is often just 5 degrees F above ambient temperature when paired with the good old Cooler Master 212 evo. I can still hit 95F with prime95 when I want to though. :)

  One of the best cpus out there... Totally worth the 350 bucks. Not sure what I category i fit in, but this thing makes me so dang happy seeing how fast it renders. Watching the temps makes my eyes water at how my old amd processor struggled at 3.4ghz with temps of 75c+ not even running anything heavy! Now using this processor with several tabs of twitch,youtube, music, steam, and a game running at high settings I am barely hitting 30-40% usage. Have not oc'd yet considering how stuff is running super smooth right now, but will be over clocking as that is the purpose of the 6700k, to be OVERCLOCKED. Amazing product, worth the extra money. As for temps I have paired this cpu with a h100i v2 and hitting idle temps of 25c and max of 35c during heavy usage, note that i am running at 4.0ghz atm. May edit later once I overclock.

Amazing chip, but very little surface area so you'll need to get a fancy (Noctua) air cooler unless you're using water cooling.

  Would post 5 stars but my biggest gripe is the teenie bit of surface area you have to cool this thing. I always go w/ air cooling when I can and found  even a Hyper V 212 Evo wouldn't keep this thing cool (maybe for stock clock speeds but that's it). Got a Noctua and now I absolutely love this chip.

  Oh yeah, this bad boy can put out the power, combine it with a great motherboard and you are set for a long time. I have not needed to overclock this in anyway shape or form yet. I game a lot and I play some pretty intensive games, this has held up to everything and then some.My only complaint is it didn't come with any stock cooling system, you HAVE to order a separate one. While that is a bit annoying if you are purchasing this sort of processor you should have some better cooling systems set up in your computer.

  I had always bought prebuilt gaming computers with AMD processors because they cost less.  This is my first build from scratch using i7 6700K.  Before in my favorite game I always had bad framerates in certain areas with AMD.  Now I haven't seen any framerate drop.  Using the same video card and exact same ultra settings I am also seeing a lot more detail in game than with AMD.  Spending the extra money on my now favorite processor brand, Intel, was well worth it.  I'm sticking with Intel from now on.

Having a base factory clock of 4 GHz is also very nice.  All of a sudden it seems that the Core i5 K option is the odd one out now that people who don't need tons of cores have a smokin Core i3 option in the 6320.  Even if you don't necessarily need Hyper Threading today I would still spend the extra hundred and get this one over the i5 for the better base frequency and futureproofing.

  I bought this to use in my first ever PC build and man am I happy I did. I could have gone with the i5-6500k or even locked, but I didn't want to be wishing I didn't save up a little more and go with this so I just went for it. Multitasking on this is a DREAM. I don't even run any very very heavy programs like people recommend this for, what they don't say though that even with everyday use you will still see a difference in speed between this and anything below it. It doesn't come with a cooler, that's fine though the Cooler Master 212 Evo is a steal at $25~ dollars and unless you're doing very intensive stuff should be more than enough cooling. Again, this thing is a workhorse and I'm very happy I went for it.

  I bought this as the processor to power my new gaming rig and it's held up incredibly well! This thing has run cooler for me than any other processor I've used but that might be because of what I bought it in combination with. I bought a nicer fan and some decent quality CPU thermal paste to go with it. Either way, you won't go wrong with this for quite a few years. I'm very happy with it and even though it's a bit of a price hike over the other i7's I can say I'm comfortable with it knowing I bought the best one I could get at the moment.Intel... well done.

  It came down to this, or an overclocked i5-6600K. Very glad I spent the extra ducats for the i7. Immediately noticed that lots of my apps (CAD, 3D modeling) used hyperthreading and used it well. It's in a very small SFF case (Node 202) with the largest cooler that'll fit (Scythe Big Shuriken 2) and it's nice to have 4GHz ""out of the box"" without the additional heat generation that you get with an overclock.

  I built my first PC with this. I upgraded from an amd 1090t HP and this thing is incredibly faster. Paired with an SSD boot time is seconds as opposed to minutes for the amd. It works fast, stays cool, and the ddr4 memory helps things stay zippy. Although a 6600k is a cheaper gaming option I feel that this is a better choice for longevity. I have not tried over clocking yet as I don't trust myself to not fry a $350 processor. But at stock speeds it is blazing, I do recommend this processor!

No bugs here! Just a superfast processor!

  I upgraded from a I5-4440 due to CPU bottlenecks I was getting. The bottlenecks are gone now as this CPU is superfast and tears up pretty much anything I can through at it.I did perform the check for the recently reported fma3 bug, per this PC World article. I am happy to report that mine does not have this issue. As for cooling, I went with a Corsair liquid cooler, given the cost was about the same for a quiet air cooling unit from Noctua.Other thoughts, I was tempted to go I5 again but realized that I would probably hit the same bottlenecks again. I also looked at the non-K version of this chip and decided to get the K version, even if I decide not to overclock. My thoughts were that this 6700k chip is already a higher clock than the i7-6700 so why not just get the processor already binned as being a higher quality chip? I am glad a chose it, despite the extra cost.Also, upgrading from Haswell to Skylake certainly is worth it from a motherboard perspective. Getting USB 3.1, DDR4, and M2 support just makes sense. Most newer devices coming out soon will be tapping into that, so why waste money on buying something on an older platform like Devil's Canyon.Just buy it! You'll be happy you did.PC world article on how to test for skylake bug:http://www.pcworld.com/article/3021023/hardware/how-to-test-your-pc-for-the-skylake-bug.html

Skylake + HandBrake; A Major Improvement over AMD FX 8320

The build in capabilities that I bought this CPU for are outlined in great deal on anadtech.com[http://www.anandtech.com/show/9562/intels-skylake-gpu-analyzing-the-media-capabilities]The new machine is composed of the following components:

Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming 7

Samsung SM951 256GB M.2 80mm PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD



Corsair Hydro Series H55 Quiet Edition Liquid CPU Cooler (CW-9060010-WW)



Corsair Carbide Series SPEC-02 Mid Tower Gaming Case (CC-9011051-WW)

i7-6700k upgraded from i7-930
","

  I upgraded from an i7-930 setup that I built in 2010. This is an extremely fast processor and from what I've seen it roughly doubles (or better) pure performance power of the 930, and that's without overclocking.  I paired it with the decently priced mid-range Asus Z170-A.The integrated HD Graphics 530 is actually capable of playing some games on it's own, as long as your expectations are pretty low.  I was able to run Crysis on High settings at an average 25 fps @1080p, which was indeed playable.  The game is from 2007 though, and when I put in my older mid-tier Geforce 660, fps would average over 100.As for the i5 compared to the i7, I run linux VMs for web development, 3D modeling in Maya and rendering with Pixar's RenderMan; I was more concerned with getting the hyper threading and the higher performance of the i7 series.  As you have probably read elsewhere, if you are just focusing on gaming it would be more efficient to get an i5.I was happy to make the jump to DDR4 for the cost/capacity ratio.  Benchmarks suggest that DDR4 speeds don't make a large difference, so I opted for the slower / general use 

Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) CL15 DR x8 Non-ECC UDIMM 288-Pin Memory CT2K8G4DFD8213/CT2C8G4DFD8213

   which has worked phenomenally.  The fact that I can upgrade to 32GB for less than $100 is extremely tempting.A couple of other notes:  If you plan on installing Windows 7 through USB you will have issues.  I had to run a program that modified the ISO to install specific USB drivers before Windows would install.  I ended up installing 8.1, because Windows 10 is a trainwreck.

  First Intel CPU, put this in a Sabertooth after an AMD FX9370 burnt a hole in my previous motherboard. Could not be happier with the results. Intel price increase is well worth it because of better heat management and sensors. The skylake series is as good as reported and so far I'm not running into the bending issue I've seen around online. Only drawback is that standard 6700 is not overclockable, but the 6700k makes up for that with not too much price difference.

  Skylake is so easy to overclock, I'll give you that!

And temps reach mid 80's with my Noctua NH D15 air cooler. I was happy with the 4.6Ghz and 1.36v with Asus Z170-A motherboard.Problem began after I updated the bios to the latest. Now, the vcore is not stable any more during stress tests. Now it jumps from 1.36v to 1.376v 1.392v and to 1.408v with the same setting as before the updated bios!Trying Adaptive and offset mode but it didn't matter, still went past 1.36v.Contacted Asus and they only asked me to first reset cmos, reset bios to default and check again (which didn't work btw). And if this didn't work, they asked me to revert back to the older bios version! The older bios version didn't have the fclk manual o.c option. So this was a huge disappointment from Asus.Ram is 2400mhz crucial 2x8GB.

Using the MOBO built-in overclocking 'tweaker', the processor overclocks by 15% and the RAM overclocks to 2500 MHz.  This processor is a beast and makes the whole Windows 10 PC scream.  Benchmark test using Performance Test 8.0 come in overall at 6620 - which is five stars in every rated category.  From off to Windows loaded is 8 seconds (minus the three second POST delay built in).  With all the overclocking, the processor still averages a cool 35 degrees Celsius using the liquid cooling system.  That's way below stated 50 degree operating temperature.  These sixth generation processors are all they are cracked up to be and more.

This is the chip you want.
","

  These are amazing chips!  I've been so impressed with this gen and how well you can overclock it!  I won the silicon lottery and got a stable and cool chip that overclocks extremely well.  Everybody gets slightly different results, but normal 4.5GHz is possible.After doing a lot of research, it's clear it's not worth getting an i5 or i3 unless it's too expensive to afford for your build.  Get tghis chip, don't waist time with the other versions.  Oh an get a Z170 if you plan to overclock.This over the 6800K?  Well, frankly Sky Lake is snazzy and worth it, in my opinion, but it's going to perform similar (better in some case, worse in others) to Broadwell-E 6800K.A lot of reviews will focus on gaming in Windows (threads unnecessary, etc.)  I don't game on it (I use linux) but I can still suggest don't waist time on the other chips and get this one.  i5s and i3s are just lower capable versions of i7 Sky Lake processors.  Plus you can disable hyperthreading if it's poor in gaming.

i7-6700K made me smile!
","

  PROS: Product is everything I expected. Performed to specs with no issues. Arrived well packaged with no damage. I don't regret purchasing the i7-6700k over the i7-5820k. This runs faster. I don't do much video rendering so I didn't require additional threads. Also, it's integrated graphics runs amazing. Easily displays at UHD. At initial startup, I thought I was already plugged into my awesome Graphics Card only to find out it was running on the CPU!!!CONS: Only one I can think of.... It would be nice if Intel also upgraded their sticker (included) to be a little bigger or maybe change to an emblem for the price we pay. I heard like on cars, if you add bigger stickers they go faster!OVERALL: Good price for the newly released SKYLAKE. You can trust Amazon to deliver this delicate hardware to you fast and in excellent condition.

4 Cores Doesn't Make it Weaker
","

  Great processor. I got it for 320 and even though it isn't the best, it is still the best with my price range (the newest and greatest going for around 1600 dollars at the time of this review). So people dislike this processor because it is only a four core processor compared to the I5 8 Core and sometimes 12 Core processors (that 1600 dollar I7-6950X Processor has 10 cores and 20 threads). Sure it has less cores but each core is stronger than the I5 cores. I really do want to make the best computer around but I am not going to spend that much for a processor so I can see the same gaming speeds or slightly better than I do with the 6700k (at the time of the review the i7-6950X is overkill and doesn't make the game play any better because we haven't caught up yet to this processor).Sure maybe I'll upgrade to the I7-6950X or some other processor in three or four years from now, but til then this processor is beast and will not let you down. It really shows you how powerful this is when you see four cores beat the 8 core I5 processor!

This thing will cook itself if you do not cool it correctly

  This thing will cook itself if you do not cool it correctly! I had some trouble with my heatsink at the beginning of my build, and this processor blows heat like crazy. Temperatures would jump to 100 degrees C within a minute under load (without a working CPU cooler). If you are buying this unlocked model, it is almost imperative that you buy a water cooler or aftermarket cooler with it. (also the fact that this does not come with a stock cooler). at 4Ghz, my H60 cools it down to about 25C idle and 40 under load, 50 while playing games. This processor scores pretty high on passmark, and gets the job done.Pros:-unlocked, up to 4.6Ghz-Performance is fantasticCons:-produces a lot of heat-uses a lot of energy..

This thing needs true liquid cooling. Still a great chip to own till Zen comes, out.

  Don't get me wrong this CPU is amazing. It runs everything extremely well and performs great in every game. However I'm not impressed with Intel's performance gains. I upgraded from a 2600k I bought in 2011 and only see about a 4-8% performance boost over my old Sandy Bridge. My advice is if you already have a i7 don't waste you money on upgrading the CPU, spend it on getting a better or 2nd GPU. You will get more FPS for you dollar.

These are supposed to be unlocked and overclockable. And they can be for the small price of completely voiding your warranty.
","

  The thermal interface material on this high-end 1151 Skylake processor is barely adequate and as I have been using both hyperthreading and the iGPU for video encoding I found this processor exceeding 100 degrees celsius.Having cut the heat spreader off and applied new thermal paste this CPU tops out at 83 degrees under full load. These are not typical gains from delidding a processor on a standard air cooler and indicates that my particular processor was running very near its thermal limits, causing runaway heat buildup with any overclock at all.This is highly disappointing. Previous entries in the 1151 i7 line featured heat spreaders which were soldered on and provided completely adequate thermal transmission.

  Bought this on June 16...by August 13th my computer wouldn't even boot up. Brought it to the local IT shop in my town. All of us thought it was definitely going to be the motherboard since CPU's rarely fail. After running every possible test we finally determined it was indeed the the CPU. My computer is well ventilated, so no way it was overheating, it was seated properly in my mobo, and I don't overclock. Absolutely no reason for CPU to be shot...but alas, here we stand. I don't know that I would say I wouldn't recommend this product, but I don't foresee myself ever buying a CPU from Amazon.

Worthy successor to Ivy Bridge.
","

  I had an Ivy i-3570k that served me well since February of '13.  Had it @ a comfortable 4.2Ghz.  Could I have held off 2+ years?  Sure.  But I thought to enhance the durability for my CPU for an additional 4-5 more years and do a complete build with the works (motherboard, RAM, PSU, SSD's).  I completed the build about 3 weeks ago, and I gotta say, OCing this chip manually, I settled on a 4.5 Ghz @ a cool 1.25V with headroom given the new 1000W platinum certified PSU I have with a delicious 12V rail.  I messed around and got to a ""17%"" overclock according to ASUS' BIOS by getting the chip up to 4.7GHZ @ 1.42V. via OCCT, but crashed about 5 minutes in.  Some room for improvement, but with a premium cooler (I prefer liquid) and a top shelf thermal paste, temps are a chilly 26°C on idle, 45°C on gaming load, and 60°-65°C on stressing levels (4.5Ghz, mind you).The only con I have of this chip is that it doesn't cook me breakfast!  *gigglesnort*  Seriously though, if you have the means and the desire, get this CPU and you will not regret it.At the end of the day, to each their own.  I upgraded to 'Skylake' out of sheer desire, not out of necessity.  You WILL love this chip if you are coming off of anything older than my previous chip (Ivy) such as a Sandy, Pentium, or AMD equivalent processor. I'm delightfully satisfied with this CPU in terms of performance improvements, the hyperthreading (coming from an i5) for multiple app tasks,  its overclocking potential, and its temperatures.  I recommend it to you without a doubt, as long as your budget can handle the additional required hardware you may need mentioned in paragraph one.My 'Skylake' build specs and some pictures:*CPU - Intel i7-6700K (4.5 for now; not in a hurry to increase it)*CPU Cooler - Corsair H110i GTX AiO Liquid cooler (My H100i broke, I upgraded to the H110i)*Motherboard - ASUS Maximus Hero VIII*RAM - Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 16GB (3000 Mhz)*GPU - ASUS STRIX 980TI 6 GB (OC edition)*Chassis - Corsair 760T Graphite Series (White Edition)*Storage - SAMSUNG 850 Pro 256 GB SSD (Boot drive), SAMSUNG 850 EVO 1 TB SSD, Intel 750 Series NVME SSD 400 GB*PSU - Corsair HX1000i (80+ Platinum Certified) (A bit overkill for non-SLI, but I got a good price for it.)*Fans - Corsair AF120's (x2) and AF140's (x4), White Edition LED*OS - Windows 10 Home, 64 Bit

I'm using an Corsair Air 240, ambient temp at 24C using a Enermax Liqmax II 240 to cool the thing. Asus Gene VIII motherboard.Out of the box it runs fine as expected, OCed fine to 4.6, 4.7 requires a bit too much voltage for my taste.For OCing I try to keep it under 80 C, and I try to keep the voltage under 1.375.I can clock it to 4.7 (100 x 47, 1.415  volts, max load line calibration) but it gets way too hot when stress testing it, it nears 90 C.Might tweak the OC, but for now 4.6 is stable and relatively cool.A PC is a combination of a lot of parts and the slowest part will bring down your overall experience.edit 01/14/2016:After the bios update to the Asus gene viii Mobo, an OC of 4.7 runs fine at 1.38 vots @ 71C max stress test for 4 hours.

I Said ""Goodbye!"" to My Space Heater
","

  Thanks to my over-obsessive compulsion to check every. single. site's availability of the 6700K every. single. moment I could, I was actually able to snag this guy from Amazon during their brief pre-order window. I installed it almost as soon as I got it.To prelude, my home doesn't have traditional AC, but a bunch of ceiling fans to circulate air. A-Frame houses are difficult to temperature control, so the summers get pretty hot. CPU temperatures mean a lot to me. For reference, my ambient temps are between 75-80F, since it's summer.I upgraded from a slightly-overclocked Nehalem i7 950. The least I can say is, my computer no longer heats up my room. My 950 saw temps between 30-50c on idle, and this is on Noctua's beastly NH-D15. Whether or not there was something wrong with my CPU/Cooler is up for debate, but I've tried multiple cooling solutions, the best being the NH-D15. With the 6700K, my temps shot down to 18-25c on idle. My mouth dropped when I saw those temps. I am interested how the temps fare during the winter.My hardest-working, CPU-strangling program at the moment is Guild Wars 2. It's funny when you can actually FEEL the difference between the processors. I am getting FPS in situations where there were no FPS before, and plenty of them. Performance doubled everywhere for me. My old CPU ran hot while GW2 was running, and I saw temps between 48-68c, which totally raised the temperature in my room--by a lot. Now, I see 35-50c, and for the first time, my computer doesn't feel like it's suffering.I know it seems like I am writing a review for the NH-D15, but I wanted to point out the overall difference I noticed upgrading from a 6-year old processor. This baby is WAY faster, while pumping out FAR less heat than my old processor. I feel like I've upgraded from a wooden-spokes wheel to a sport's tire.I still have loads of testing I want to do, but my initial impression is ""WOW"".

The best high-end mainstream processor, but very short in supply
","

  Pros: Very fast, very efficient, best mainstream CPUCons: Massive shortage, priceIf you're looking to build a computer right now, then the 6700k along with the Z170 chipset are the best mainstream components you can get right now. The 6700k is an excellent processor and outperforms its predecessors. Combined with a Z170 motherboard, this CPU can be overclocked to well over 4.5 GHz. If you're shopping around for CPUs, you probably have done the research and already know about the 6700k, so there's no need to reiterate the reviews.Intel's suggested price for the 6700k is $350, but you will not find anything near that price right now (December 2015) because there is a huge shortage in supply. I don't expect supply to catch up to demand until at least the end of January or beginning of February 2016. Don't pay too much for the CPU; even though it's the latest and greatest, it doesn't make sense to pay $400+ when you can get a Haswell-E for the same price. Just wait a few months for the supply to catch up again or if you want, wait until Q2 of 2016 for the Broadwell-E chips.I built an ITX machine with this and the Gigabyte Z170N Gaming 5 mobo, and it's been serving me well. It runs quiet and cool, and is very power efficient. It's just a secondary machine right now, but I'll probably convert it to a home media/streaming PC pretty soon.Note that this processor doesn't come with a stock heatsink so you need to get your own cooling solution. This isn't really a con, since a stock heatsink wouldn't be enough for it anyway. If you can get it for $350, then it's a great deal, shortage or not. It's hard to compare CPU prices nowadays since AMD processors have not been competitive for a long time. Intel can pretty much price these however they want, but the good thing is it's not overpriced by any means.For most builders, the 6700k is sufficient. If you're looking to build a high-end X99 system, then obviously this isn't the processor for you. Either get the 5930k or wait for the Broadwell-E in 2016. If you want a system purely for gaming, then this processor is a bit of an overkill - get the i5 6600k instead and spend the money on a nicer graphics card.Thoughts on whether or not to upgrade:If you're still using a Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge processor, then I think it's worth upgrading. You can check many benchmarks online, but you can expect a 30-40% improvement on some applications, and the power consumption improvement might be worth it.If you're using Haswell or Broadwell, then I don't think it's worth it. There is a very slight performance improvement, but I would save money and wait until Intel releases Kaby Lake processors sometime in 2016.If you're using anything older (like Core 2), then Skylake and Z170 is a worthy upgrade.

I bought one from Bookshelfbetty, and it failed after 8 months, with no overclocking.  the stock frequencies wore fast enough for me.  I have confirmed with intel that it has indeed failed, and tha'ts how i found out that it's an OEM unit.  So the first mistake is NOT telling people that this is an OEM unit and is not warrantied by intel.  Second mistake is posting intels 3 year warranty in the add.  That warranty does NOT apply to this cpu.  If i had known then that it's an OEM,unit, then i would have bought it from some where else.  I have made multiple attempts to contact Bookshelfbetty, and have had zero replies.  I'm not trying to say anything bad about the cpu.  It's actually really amazing.  I'm just trying to inform future buyers of what they are buying from Bookshelfbetty. I've been building custom rigs for over a decade, and this is the first time i've ever had a cpu fail.  What is an OEM cpu?  think of it like this.  Lets say the cpu in your HP laptop failed.  You wouldn't go to intel for repairs.  you would go to HP for your warranty.  Because they are the OEM of that laptop.  I hope this helps anyone looking to buy a 6700k.  I would recommend this cpu, but i would NOT recommend buying this one.

NOT as good as AMD

  First, this is MY review. If you don't like it, go write your own because YES I am going to badmouth the Intel name here.30 some years PC building and running experience. I run Pro Tools DAW which is what this machine is primarily for. I am NOT a gamer, who has time? Multitasking and handling heavy workloads are the goal here.I should NEVER have listened to Intel biased people. Even the pro PC shop near me told me to go Ryzen.It doesn't matter which OS, Win10 or Win7, this CPU can't handle the task. Pro Tools sessions that ran without a hitch, with my ""old"" AMD fx-6300 six-core now require as much as 8x the buffer size and the maximum assignable CPU power just to play a tune without freezing. This creates latency issues making recording nearly impossible.Two Intels in my house, this one and an i5 in my laptop are enough for me see for myself that Intel is a FAR cry from what it's fans claim it to be.

  I really haven't felt the need (or want) to update my PC's motherboard and processor. It edits high bitrate 4K videos speedily on Resolve and runs modern titles in 4K60 with an EVGA RTX 2080 FTW3 Hybrid at Ultra settings and beyond what can be cranked up to 11. I've been using it at stock clocks with a Corsair H100i and it has never failed due to temperature. A week ago I overclocked it to 4.4 GHz on the BIOS to get higher benchmark scores and have been using it like that daily for hours. I haven't desired to run it at 4.5 GHz other than testing it for a little bit.It has been a 5 STAR processor to me, and I will continue to use it until it holds back my system. God bless you!

Fastest All-Around CPU on the Market
","

  The 6700k is hands-down the best all-around processor available. Unless you are exclusively using software designed to take advantage of multiple processors, this processor will give you the best performance across all of your typical windows applications. You can pair this processor with the latest DDR4 ram and the speedy M.2 solid state drive and have the fastest computer in town. The 6700k can be comfortably overclocked to around 4.5GHz without putting too much stress on your build, although it's already plenty fast without the need to overclock if this is something you're not experienced with.Keep in mind that there is no heatsink provided, I paired mine with a closed-loop watercooler which is whisper-quiet and offers great heat dissipation. I built my computer with this 6700k to replace a 5 year old build and I've never experienced a snappier setup. Windows 10 boots up in under 5 seconds from being powered off. I'm blown away with the performance of my computer which is centered around this chip. I feel like I've been about twice as productive since this upgrade. My compile times for mobile apps reduced by about 65%, photoshop file processing time reduced by around 50%, and my browser keeps up even with about 80+ tabs open.The 6700k is slightly overpriced at the moment until supply catches up to the demand, but I still think it's worth it, especially if you're planning a computer build and don't want to wait another 6 months for the prices to trickle down.My full PC Specs:Fractal Design Define R5 http://amzn.to/1V5e0oESamsung SM951 M.2 http://amzn.to/1gCOUxBNZXT Kraken X61 http://amzn.to/1O7uUNYCrucial Ballistix Sport 32GB http://amzn.to/1HyW5NYIntel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz CPU http://amzn.to/1KZPgfJCorsair HX1000i 1,000 Watt PSU http://amzn.to/1Lm0XdQXFX Radeon R9 290A http://amzn.to/1McCgCpMSI Computer Z170A Motherboard http://amzn.to/20JKswU

Best i7 on the Market, But That Doesn't Mean You Need It
","

  My short review is:  This is the best high-end processor you can by at the moment, but unless you're upgrading from a processor more than 5 years old or really doing some demanding tasks, you won't notice a difference in real-world testing.  Benchmarks will say otherwise, but most of the time, it's about real world usage, not graphs and charts on benchmark results.For more details, continue to read...I have two machines I use, both Core i7s.  My first one is a i7-3770K @ 4.5GHz and my second is a i7-5930K @ 4.5GHz.  I purchased the i7-6700K to replace my 3770K, but ended up building this machine from the ground up so I could donate my 3770K to a fellow gamer on a budget. :)Before donating my 3770K, I tested out a few games, both machines running a RAID 0 setup of 500GB SSDs, 32GB of RAM and GTX980Ti.  Initial feel of both machines was identical.  I didn't notice a real difference during the install of Windows 10 or installation of games.  In some testing of games, CS:GO, Witcher 3 and Crysis 3, the FPS was all within 5% of each other.  I couldn't tell a difference between machines at all.I then began to overclock the 6700K and got it running at 4.5GHz stable with a H100i AIO, but anything beyond that required too many volts than I felt comfortable with.  At this point, I had about a 15-20% increase in FPS, but mainly in Witcher and Crysis.  Was it enough to really tell a difference?  Not really...In terms of benchmarks, there is a significant increase in performance between the two, especially with the 6700K @ 4.5GHz.  But real world testing didn't show much of a gain.  If I was to do it again, I'd just save my $$$ for the next generation, Kaby Lake, which should have more enthusiast options.You can't fault this processor though, it's great and one of the best options you can get, especially if you don't need/use all the cores that a 5930K has to offer.  Additionally, if you're only looking to game, the i5-6600K would be the better way to go, especially if you're on a budget.  Use the money saved for a better video card.Also, as others have stated, the retail for this processor is $350.  There is a low supply/high demand of these currently, so I'd check other vendors before purchasing from Amazon.  But then again, if this processor is selling over retail, it's even more of a reason to wait for a more substantial upgrade.

Is the 6700K worth the upgrade?
","

  I bought the 6700K at my local electronics shop because Amazon didn’t have it in stock when I put my build together.The 6700K is Intel’s latest flagship CPU.Just like all of its other K-series i7 processors, it features 4 cores with hyper-threading and an unlocked multiplier. You’ll get a 4.0 GHz clock speed with a turbo boost frequency of 4.2 GHz.One of the biggest improvements that Skylake has to offer is in its improved thermal outputs. Intel has successfully reduced heat output by improving power efficiency and removing the voltage regulator off the CPU and back onto the motherboard. At stock speeds, I haven’t seen the 6700K go above 35 C with a H110i GT cooler (fans configured to silent mode). Even overclocked, the 6700K stays cool and my fans stay silent. Keep in mind that the 6700K (and the 6600K) does not come with a stock cooler so you won’t be able to use it while you wait for your aftermarket cooler to arrive.(Stock Speed)  (Overclocked 4.7 GHz at 1.32 V)Idle: 19 C Load: 52 C  Idle: 23 C Load: 63 CCinebench: 925  Cinebench: 1015Skylake is certainly worth considering if you’re building a new PC or upgrading from an older chipset. But if you’re running a newer platform like Sandy or Ivy Bridge, it probably isn’t worth spending you’re money on the upgrade.-------------------------System SetupIntel Core i7-6700K (4.7 GHz at 1.3 V)Corsair H110i GT (fans configured to silent mode)IC Diamond Thermal CompoundCrucial 16 GB (2x8GB) DDR4-2400 RAMAsus Z170-ASamsung 950 Pro 512 GB SSDEVGA GTX Titan XCorsair AX860i PSU3x Asus ROG Swift PG278QOpen air test benchAmbient Temp: ~60 F

Substantial improvement from i5-2500K!
","

  Finally upgraded from my trusty i5-2500K to this, and let me tell you I was not expecting such a dramatic improvement.I was very hesitant at first to upgrade because so many people on forums are saying how there's very little improvement over the old Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge processors, but... they're wrong.Games such as the Total Wars and Fallout 4 run MUCH more smoothly, but the most dramatic improvement was on Blade and Soul.  I went from not being able to do large raids AT ALL to doing 24-man raids with virtually no frame drop.  That game has a terrible CPU restriction, which is now fortunately solved (I'm talking from 1-2fps with my Sandy Bridge to a solid 35-60fps depending on the situation on my Skylake!!!)  :)Also helps that I overclocked with my new liquid water cooler to 4.5GHz, and have RAM overclocked to 3400MHz, but the processor... such a huge upgrade.System Specs:Corsair Air540 caseCorsair H110i GT CPU coolerRadeon R9 290 Reference GFX card (from my old rig)16GB (8x2) G.SKILL TridentZ 3400MHz DDR4 MemoryCrucial MX200 1TB SSD (from old rig)Gigabyte G1 Gaming GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 motherboardThermaltake Toughpower 775w PSU (from old rig)2 640GB 7200RPM HDD in Raid0 (yes they are different brands, but they work, and from my old rig)

  Honestly, I knew what I was getting into. I replaced my 5.11ghz i7-2600k setup with something built around this. The clocks I got were around 4.7ghz even with a very large radiator, good block and d5 pump. Only a bit faster than the old i7 at that clockspeed for most of the workflows I do. Biggest benefit to this is the platform now supports 64GB of ram instead of 32.If you have an older 920 setup, prepare to be blown away. If you need more ram over an older 2600, 3700, 4790k setup, sure. If you need more performance? Pick up a used dual e5 v2 system and call it a day, because these aren't the answer.

  Upgrading from an ageing veteran phenom quad core, I can only say that this cpu is blazing fast. Matching it with good RAM and an SSD is apparently standard nowadays, but for me, being my first real build and my first time with an i7, I have to say I am giggling like a fool for how impressed I am.I was first going for the i5, but read that the hyperthreading could really help me for video editing so I decided to go for the 6700k this time. So far as the initial test have gone, this is what I was looking for and what I needed.May update in the future if I discover anything new, but so far, this thing is the bomb!

This quad core processor is great for anyone who wants to take their gaming experience ...
","

  The intel i7 6700k is a top of the line consumer based processor. This quad core processor is great for anyone who wants to take their gaming experience as well as intensive multitasking to the next level. This CPU is intel’s new Skylake processor, which in turns provide the same power as the previous generation CPU. This results in less power wattage needed to run the CPU. This, in turn, lowered the temperature of my PC letting it run longer without needing to give it time to cool down. This CPU has many benefits compared to last generation`s Haswell model CPU. However, this i7 6700k is the best consumer based CPU and can only be topped by the more premium non-consumer CPU offered by Intel.This CPU offers 4 real cores as well as 4 hyperthreaded cores which are imaginary cores that can help simulate the processes done by the real cores. This in turn creates 8 cores that can split the operating system tasks without losing performance. For example, the i7 6700k could run the Witcher three, a 4k YouTube video, as well as Windows Movie Maker at the same time on 3 different monitors. This is can only be handled by the top of the line CPUs. Another benefit of having a strong CPU is the availability of other parts that can work with it. I could buy the new NVidia GTX 1080, a gpu, which runs all video separated from the CPU. Older CPUs that are not as strong as this one will experience bottlenecking which the limiting of the CPU full potential due to the hardware not being fully optimizable to run its best. With this i7 CPU chip, I was also able to purchase a stronger motherboard that allowed overclocking as well as the new ddr4 ram. This in turn opened faster multitasking as well as the overclocking potential given by the motherboard and the k letter in the i7 6700k. Overclocking lets me surpass the default stock boost clock speeds that the manufacturers placed. It allows me to bypass and speed it to the limit my PC hardware lets me. This in turn gave me more frame rates as well as the ability to run max 4k quality for my videos and editing as well as gaming.In my own experiences, this CPU was a perfect fit for my custom build PC. This CPU met all my needs in my day to day use as well as more intense activities. I would highly recommend it to regular consumers who may want to dive into video editing and photoshop. This would also be the perfect choice for gamers who want to run their GPUs at full without experiencing bottlenecks. I could run the necessary programs to edit videos for my family as well as smash all those who oppose me on Super Smash Bros on my Wii emulator running on my PC. However, for my premium activities such as engineering projects or design of software, more CPUs may be better.Some cons of this CPU don’t affect 95% of the world who use their PCs for day to day use which this i7 processor can run with no issues. However, the remaining 5 percent may look down upon some of the problems this CPU might cause. One thing is that this CPU only offers 4 real cores. The technology of hyperthreading is extremely effective. But on the contrary, nothing is like having a solid core. Some other CPUs intel offers such as the i7 5960x has 8 real cores. This can edge out the i7 6700k and defeat it on intensive applications. However, the one downside is the price point. Unlike the i7 6700k, which only runs for about $350, the i7 5960x is nearly $1100. The high premium price matches the high premium performance. Other issues the i7 6700k face is that after 2 to 3 years, the usability of the chip will become obsolete with the introduction of new CPUs. This will affect its compatibility with new GPU and other PC parts that will come out in the new future. However, this will only affect the small percentage of users who need the highest premiums in regards to pc parts. Although the i7 6700k might have some downsides, the majority of the population will never face such issues.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this CPU to any new PC builders, replacement CPUs, as well as PC enthusiast who want to know more about the PCs main control center. At this price range, this is the best CPU you can get that offers high end performance. I had no problem writing this review on my very own i7 6700k, while still having enough power left to run internet explorer at regular speeds.

  No complaints after a year. I have really liked my computer overall with this chip installed. Seems fast and no reliability issues. I have an h100i corsair liquid cooler and it keeps it in the 20s-30s C for temperature. I have removed the stock corsair thermal compound and replaced after 1 year and it stil functions well. While it was uninstalled I used it to breathe life into my buddies emulator machine that needed a bios update in order to function with his CPU.

Idle temps for me are around 25C-35C and it will run Prime 95's Small FFTs test (the maximum heat one) for hours on end and won't exceed 78C. Not too shabby when 100C is the limit!

I am a little disappointed that it didn't come with a stock cooler, but who really uses it anyway? The cooler for my i7 860 is still sitting in the box unused. I have noticed a nice jump in performance. This processor handles multi-threaded programs like a champ and is perfect for simultaneous Twitch streaming while gaming.

  Pros: Overclocks well with some tweaking on a Gigabyte Gaming 7 Mobo. I think the difficulties came with the choice of mobo and not the chip itself. However my first chip that arrived was faulty. Once I got my RMA it was amazing.I was able to stably OC to 4.7 for a 20 hour pass in AIDA64 (I stopped it myself) and a 14 hour pass on prime 28.xx! (this was an accident i forgot to close prime and fell asleep, at one point the temp spiked to 85c but my average during that night was 59c so overall very pleased with that)I stream primarily CSGO.(very cpu intensive game) AT stock cpu speed I get 300 fps constant while streaming with quicksync and my temps dont go above 60c (avg 52c during stream sessions). I have also streamed battlefront at 1080p all settings to Ultra never dipped below 80fps on stock cpu speeds.While this cpu overclocks adequately there is literally no need for my current needs to push the voltage and temps, but at least I know I can in the future.While on paper the 6700k seems like a minor upgrade from 2600k this is actually far superior at lesser or similar clocks. For example my 2600k streaming GO with quicksync was hovering around 200 fps avg with a 4.5 oc. I only achieved 300 fps pushing it to 4.9ish with alot of tweaking and hassle in the bios. The 6700k does it smoothly right out of the box, and at absolute max settings might I add.Couldn't be more pleased.Cons: PriceIf you are a gamer looking for a streaming CPU look no further. This chip will handle anything you throw at it. However here are some tips in case you run into issues streaming.- The new Intel HDs don't seem to like OBS and Win 7. Win 8.1 and 10 should be fine.- Always use the Intel HD driver that is on your mobo's driver list via said companies website. This will help you avoid QSVHELPER.EXE errorsThose are two pretty time saving tips that took some searching for me to resolve.

Anyways, I am upgrading from an i7-2600k @ 4.2 and I am seeing a massive increase in performance, up to 2x in some games.  My old system: i7-2600k, 8GB DDR3, Samsung 850 pro, GTX 980, Win 10.  New: i7 6700k (no OC), 16GB DDR4, (same SSD), (same GTX 980), Same Win 10 OS install (i'll explain).On my old system I could run Battlefield 4 maxed @1080p and avg about 60-90 frames depending on the map.  On the new system I am running 1440p max settings and am pulling 85-130 frames depending.  At 1080p settings I was avging around 115 fps.  For Metal Gear Solid 5 frames are capped at 60, though my new system does not hitch at 1440p.If you have Windows 10 you will probably not have to re-install your OS.  It's up to you... some will have varying opinions, though just to see what would happen I installed the new board, ram, and processor and it booted in to Windows after it detected the hardware changes and automatically adjusted the drivers it needed.  Windows had pulled some drivers in, though ones it did not recognize it defaulted to Windows default and deactivated the incompatible ones.  I loaded the drivers afterward and was up and running within about 15 minutes... no reinstall necessary.  The only thing I had to do is call Microsoft to migrate my Win 10 pro key as Windows would not automatically activate.

  Get one.  This CPU worked flawlessly right out of the box on my ASrock Z170 K6+ MOBO.  I upgraded from a AMD Quad Core Phenom 945 X4...which was a lame performer right off the shelf at one of the larger big box electronics stores.  And, when you start so low...performance only gets worse...not better.Buy as good as you can.  If you don't need hyper-threading, aka multitasking, consider the i5-6600K...way under clocked in it's stock version.  And, also killer powerful.For these high-end CPU's, I wish they'd drop the on-board CPU video processor...most everyone buys stand alone video cards and in truth...you're not going to get high end performance out of an on-die video processor.  I mean, really...flagship CPU...consumer grade on-die video processor...what's the thinking, Intel?

  It was really expensive like $419. But I know it was the best CPU for gaming. So I decided to buy it. I was able to OC it to 4.7GHz Maximum. But for stable daily usage I OC it to 4.6GHz. Everything running smoothly. I give 5 Stars !!! By the way, I use complete water cooling system. So I can run 100% usage between 55~65c.

  The money you save building your own system vs a retail system is huge. Take the challenge and drop this into a compatible motherboard and you wont regret it. No graphics card required. This processor feels future proof for any internet browsing, you tube and netflix watching you will ever throw at it. I have been using a newer graphics card with this and the results are drastically better that what I was using from 5 years ago. Thinking of doing another setup with this immediately.

Great CPU, if you are upgrading beware of DDR4 motherboards! Your old ram most likely won't work. Pair it with a DDR3 mobo !
","

  Awesome processor, the one I got didn't come with a heatsink/fan so I had to buy one separate which was  a pain but overall this processor is VERY fast. Very easy to install. If you do buy this processor please be aware that most motherboards for LGA1151 use DDR4. While most benchmarks show no gain by going to DDR4, it adds a big expense for those who are just upgrading their motherboard/cpu. That is why I went with the Asus Z170-P D3 LGA1151 ATX motherboard which supports my old DDR3 ram. Great upgrade otherwise!

Freezing/Hard Lock
","

  Hello, I've been having a freezing problem right from the start with this processor on my new Skylake build. I put together this system last month, in January 2016. All parts are brand new and fresh install of windows 10.System:Case: Corsair Carbide Series Air 540 High Airflow ATX Cube CaseCPU: i7 6700k Skylake 4.00GHZGPU: MSI GTX 980 TiMotherboard: ASUS ROG MAXIMUS VIII HEROSSD: OCZ Storage Vector 180 Series 960GBSSHD: Seagate 4TBPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA GOLD 850WRAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 2400MHzOS: Windows 10 64-bitThermal Paste: Arctic SilverIn the off-chance anything might be helpful, and because it's starting to frustrate the crap out of me, here's a dump of everything I've learned so far about my particular issue, and other things that could possibly be related.Alright, so I am experiencing complete system freezes at random moments. Screen remains displaying the moment of the freeze. Also, speakers will occasionally play a harsh deafening sound. Basically, the speakers remain outputting the last tone of whatever was being played at the moment of the freeze, if there was one. The louder the volume is turned up and depending on what tone is being played, it can be very unpleasant and almost deafening if using a headset. With that being said, if the speakers were silent of the time of crash, there will be no ""screech of death"" since no tone is being played.At first I thought it was an issue with the GPU, sound card, motherboard, etc. Issues pointed towards my audio drivers conflicting. After disabling all audio devices except the speakers and updating drivers the problem still occurs. Problem occurs using both headset and speakers. After a ton of research and troubleshooting I have finally narrowed it down to the new skylake CPU's. I am trying everything to make my PC stable and the longest I've gone without a freeze is 24 hours, maybe 2 days. Sometimes I will get 3-4 crashes in a day if I'm playing a lot.So here is what I've tried so far:Updating various drivers/BIOS. No effect even with the most recent BIOS dated January 7th, 2016.I have also tested the memory using memtest86 returning no errors..Problem has been reproduced on many storage devices. SSD, SSHD, and HDD. One user even reported freezes during USB flash drive boot-ups.The problem has been reproduced using many different Mobo and RAM manufactures. I personally have tested both corsair and G.skill. Others have reported using crucial, gskill, and corsair with different sizes, frequencies, and mobos. Everyone is getting the same freezes. I am close to RMA'ing just to mess around with some different hardware but I honestly don't think it will fix the issue since others have already tried that. Also, Corsair and G.skill is some of the best memory on the market so I really don't think that memory is to blame here.This has also been brushed off as an overheating issue by some users. I suspected it was overheating since I was crashing at around 70 Celsius while playing taxing games like Ark:Survival on max settings. That's what you do when you build a new rig, right? Then I tested it playing Heroes of the Storm and other low end games. Problem persists even at 40-50 degrees Celsius.. So it can't possibly be an overheating issue. Others have showed similar low temps while freezing occurs. I have also already noted that some users are freezing while idle. Lately I keep Speccy up 24/7 just to see what my temps are during freezes. Temperatures do not seem to correlate with the freezing.So I already mentioned I was able to reproduce the crashing in many different applications, mostly video games like Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends, Smite etc just to ensure it wasn't a problem with any one application. I have yet to freeze during idle, however my system sleeps after 30 minutes so that is probably why I haven't experienced a freeze yet while idling. I am going to turn off sleep mode tonight just to see if I crash while idling. I have ran prime95 tests and pushed my CPU to 100% many times without returning any errors. Also, freezing occurs while playing the most taxing games such as Ark:Survival as well as low end video games such as League of Legends. I've reinstalled windows 10 as a fresh install even though this was a new build and it was already a new partition. Freezing still occurs. Also worth noting that it tends to happen at the most crucial moments of the game(hehe).I have read many posts of people blaming it on a bad batch of CPU's. After doing a ton of research I have found the issue to persist in about 75% of the new Skylake processors. Some enthusiasts have already RMA'd their CPU's two, three, some even 50 times over again with the crashing still occurring.One user made a very strong point worth noting:A big clue is that this is hard locks (not a software lock). You know this because interrupts have stopped.. the system is dead in an unnatural way actually. These are caused by very specific things (usually a race condition of some sort) and usually at a very low level (not software controlled in any way). Yes it can be a failed setup of hardware (bad driver register settings) but its not a software code execution failure, there was no line of code that died in this moment.This points directly to faulty hardware, not a software or driver issue, however it is worth mentioning that a BIOS update may fix it in the future. This is all speculation and doesn't really point towards a fix. However, If I am right, you should all wait a bit longer before RMA'ing since you will not get ""fixed"" versions until the next gen is released.The most frustrating part of this issue is that it can occur anywhere from 30 mins to 12 hours into a session. It is just really random and almost rare enough for me to just ignore. Extremely unpredictable. However, spending so much money on a new Skylake build I expect flawless performance.Hopefully we can get this issue resolved. I really don't feel like RMA'ing any more parts or downgrading to 5th gen. To anyone with the same issue, please let me know if you find a fix. I will update with any new information. Good luck.Update: Some are blaming bad batch of CPU's.Here is my batch: #L539B636Also, it passed in Intel Processor Diagnostic ToolUpdate2: After about a month of troubleshooting I've finally got a stable system. Not even sure what fixed it honestly because I've tried so many solutions. I recently overclocked the CPU and raised the voltages of my RAM in BIOS so I'm pretty sure that's what fixed the crashes. I will update if I crash/freeze again but so far it's been a week with no issues so I think we are good.update3: Started Crashing again after playing some Ark and Black Desert Online this week. I crash about once or twice a day. I play for about 8 hours a day. This really needs to get fixed. I think I am done tinkering with RAM voltages and all this BIOS crap I'm just going to load default and possibly purchase a new CPU.Update4: I finally gave up and ordered a new processor. I down graded to i7 5820 haswell. I'm about 3 months in with no crashes or freezing so the issue was definitely the processor. I'm a little disappointed but at least now my system is stable.

It works well, but it isn't worth $420, go with the 4790k instead.
","

  I bought the 6700k to use in a task that requires very high amounts of CPU resources and comparatively few GPU resources, so I do not have an external GPU in my PC. As expected, it works very well for that task, being able to do 233% more work than my old processor, an i7 930. At idle it runs at a couple degrees above room temperature (24C), which is half the temperature my 930 ran at when idle, while at 100% load (overclocked to 4.62 GHZ) it hovers between 60 and 68C, 10-15C lower than my 930 at 80% load.Like some of the other 4 star reviews, I deducted a star because of the relatively poor price/performance ratio of the 6700k. I recommend buying the 4790k, which is only slightly slower than the 6700k and only $300, until the price of the 6700k drops back down to at least $350.

Skylakes New Chip is a Performance Powerhouse with Worthy Feature Upgrades. Avg. 6%-12% Speed Increases.
","

  I purchased this in Japan during my visit during release and decided to put up a review due to seeing none on here.  I also picked up a i5-6600k for my brother which I've already reviewed.The i7-6700k is intels' quad core update to the devil canyon's i7-4790k and clocks at 4 ghz stock and turbo speeds go to 4.2ghz. It's easily one of the better overclocking chips out as it's thermal structure has been improved.  It's performance is from my benchmarks are around 6%-12% faster than my i7-4790k, which makes it worth the price difference.Price: The MSRP on the i7-6700k is $350 which is inline with previous comparable cpu's, but looking at the whole picture with the skylake (z170) chipset you have to buy a new motherboard that supports it of which most are easily $100 over z97 motherboards as well as expensive ddr4 memory. Of all the motherboards out for the skylake platform (z170) most currently do not support the cheaper ddr3 or ddr3L.So overall the cpu costs may be similar but you should expect a $200 or so cost premium over the devil's canyon z97 build (even more as deals for the older chipset come out).  I'm more than willing to pay that for the other new features that are included with skylake which i'll get into below.What's new:With the skylake platform comes some features which are now included standard with most z170 motherboards. The first is USB 3.1 which will double USB speeds to 10gbps. The second being DMI 3.0, which allows 4 x PCIE  3.0 lanes as well as up to 20 pci express lanes. M.2 SSD's while not a skylake exclusive will now be compatible with the 4x PCIE 3.0 lanes meaning you'll be able to achieve SSD speeds of up to 8gb's (The SM951 is at 2gbps at the moment). The third significant change being DDR4 which is the next memory speed upgrade iteration.Performance:Although I upgraded to skylake more for the other new features, the CPU was definitely a factor as I encode quite a bit of video as well. I noticed a 8% increase in my video encoding speeds on the x264 encoding platform compared to the i7-4790k. When it came to gaming I didn't really notice much of an improvement as my system since the i7-4790k and 6700k both did a very good job at it. Photoshop definitely was faster at rendering files, and combined with my new M.2 sm951 hard drive loaded up much faster as well.  I was able to overclock this baby to 4.6ghz with 100% stability with relative ease. That further increases speeds another 10%.Performance wise I overall say a 6-12% increase of speeds (before overclock). Not too good, but enough to keep me happy.Heat/Power Usage: I noticed the overall heat in my case which is air cooled did not rise above 30 degrees at idle and did not rise about 55 degrees on load. Which was much better over my 4790k which had temps of around 5 degrees higher during load. This is with the noctua u9s heatsink. Power usage was 110 watts which is the same as the 4790k. I'd also suggest if you want to put on your own thermal paste, put it in a line patter from down to up with a triangle on the bottom left. I was told the pea version isn't as effective on skylake.Conclusion: Overall I'd highly recommend purchasing a i7-6700k over the now outdated i7-4790k due to the speed increases, new skylake features, as well as better thermal structuring. I wouldn't upgrade from the 4790k to the 6700k but if I was building a new rig from scratch I'd definitely go for it over the 4970k. Compared to the i5-6600k in stock it's also much faster. Note: If you're on a tighter budget I'd suggest either using devil's canyon or if you still want skylake go for the i5-6600k, you can overclock that to 4.2ghz and save yourself $100. If you're not that advanced of a user or want the latest and best I'd still recommend the i7-6700k over it. Also if you're divided between the z99 series and skylake and need more cores (8-12) go with the x99 series. It's not a comparable platform.My current build for referance: https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=Z3TH99

  This is a good CPU, as long as you don't intend to run Windows 7.If you love your Windows 7 system, beware of running it with ANY processor newer than Broadwell. This 6700K is Skylake. M$ is being very aggressive getting users to upgrade to their BS Windows 10. While security updates for Windows 7 do not end until 2020, M$ has publicly stated they will stop doing security updates other than critical for Windows 7, running on Skylake CPUs or newer, in July, 2018. It was originally just about a year from now in July 2017.  M$ is trying to pave the way for their Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription service crap like Adobe does now. They've stated that Windows 10 is the last version of Windows.They do have a short list of OEM manufacturers whose machines with Skylake processors will get security updates through 2020. Just not us DIY people.Because M$ decided to play hardball, I've decided not to upgrade my Windows 7 system to this processor but instead will go with a Broadwell or Devil's Canyon processor so I can safely keep using my system until 2020 and probably beyond.

  I am very pleased with this processor coming from Ivy Bridge. Very fast CPU and seems to OC easily.  It's already screaming fast with turbo to 4.2GHz, but mine went to 4.6GHz with no effort, and as soon as I have time I'm going to push toward the 5GHz mark and see how it does.  Using a H80i, I am idling in the teens.  I thought something was wrong at first because it was running so cool.  But BIOS confirms these temps.  Right now RealTemp shows 17/16/17/16 C.  Nice. Under load it hits 40-45C (not Prime but gaming -BF4).  Very good temps at 4.6GHz!  Overall I am very happy with purchase.  Hope you weren't one of the early adopters who paid $400 or more.  The prices dropped a few days after launch. I paid $369 and also got a MSI Z170A Gaming M7 board for it.  They're a great match.  Corsair Vengeance DDDR4 3000MHz rounded out my build.  Awesome CPU!  If you are Sandy Bridge or older I recommend it.  I was having issues with my rig so I bit the bullet and bought this.  So glad I did.Skylake was worth the wait.  Oh and yes a i7 5820k will beat it in some multi threaded apps, but not in gaming, regular single threaded applications and day to day use.  Those people who need 6 or 8 cores aren't the average day to day consumer.  They are the E crowd or high end Enthusiasts.  It's a fine proc but it's not ""better"" than the i7 6700k.

  I am not generally a hardware reviewer but wanted to put an actual item review up here beyond just warnings about price gouging. The following is an actual review of this item, purchased from Amazon France in early August before they stopped sending them abroad.In-depth technical reviews are available on Anandtech and elsewhere, so this is a more of a 'what you need to know' summary.The i7-6700K (and its younger brother, the i5-6600K) are targeted toward enthusiasts. You will pay a premium (even at MSRP) for the latest and greatest; if you've been holding off building a computer for a few years, that's probably fine; ""Skylake"" is a fine iteration of Intel's flagship consumer processor, but the price premium in the other parts required does not necessarily translate to every day, real world performance.Note that, unlike previous Intel retail processors, Skylake CPUs do not include a 'stock' heat sink and fan. While the stock units were never very effective, be sure to factor in another $20-$40 for an aftermarket CPU fan/heatsink. Most newer coolers compatible with 'Haswell' and 'Broadwell' chips will fit the LGA 1151 socket. Installation for the i7-6700K and the i5-6600K is largely unchanged - if you've installed an Intel CPU since 2008, you know what you need to know.The chipset required for the i7-6700K (a Z170 motherboard) is also brand new, in fairly limited supply, and priced accordingly. Chipsets and processors for the previous generations of the i5 and i7 line have been around for some time and you'll have your pick at any price point.  Most (if not all) Z170 motherboards on the market as of late August 2015 require DDR4 memory, so you won't be able to use RAM from prior-generation motherboards except for a handful of high-end boards new enough that you probably don't need to upgrade anyway. The Z170 spec does allow for motherboards to support the older DDR3 standard, however, so expect to see those before too much longer.There are some features unique to Skylake, like a digital signal processor (DSP) that can 'wake' the CPU from audio input (i.e. voice control) under Windows 10. This and other features like WiGig (Wireless gigabit) and wireless charging may not mean much for a desktop product right now, but they are likely to become the 'new normal' before long.The Z170 chipset can support the newest USB 3.1 standard for high-speed peripherals as well as PCIe lanes for add-in card or M.2 solid state drives. These are not unique to Skylake but they are starting to become standard rather than optional, 'high end' features.CONCLUSION: If you're on a budget, you may be better served (for now) putting your dollars toward a Broadwell or Haswell build; if you do want to 'future proof' but still stretch your dollars as far as they can go, pick up the i5-6600K instead of the i7-6700K -- you'll benefit from the new chipset features and will very likely be able to drop in Intel's next generation CPUs in 2016 if your i5 is insufficient (though it shouldn't be).If you're part of the target market or you haven't rebuilt your desktop in a long time, you won't be disappointed. Look for availability issues to be resolved in early September and for prices on the Z170 motherboards to come down as more come to market in the Fall of 2015.

  Actually managed to get a dead CPU. After trying 2 motherboards / 3 SSDs / 3 PSUs / 2 GPUs / 3 USB thumb drives for installation along with DVD. The CPU is dead. Essentially I was an unlucky sob. Heres hoping Amazon will process an RMA if not I will have to deal with Intel directly.

","

  I want to express my opinion about the marketing of this nice processor. Intel first must attend desktop manufacturers, next on-line stores like Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, , etc. Be aware about speculators, as when Amazon get their big stock (maybe 5,000, indeed I have not idea), it won't be strange  for I if Amazon sells this CPU in sale for $339.99-349.99 and free shipping! In my case I own the 4790k, so it doesn't I make sense (IMO) the upgrade buying a new Mobo (Z170) and new memory (DDR4). But, of course, its up to you. For every thing else, I highly recommend this processor.

GUYS WHY IS EVERY SELLER GIVING FAULTY STUFF TO ME, LIKE LAST TIME I BOUGHT A 960 AND THE FANS KEPT SURGING UP AND DOWN AND WHEN I REPLACE NEW ONE THE PROBLEM STOPPED. HENCE I AM SO SICK AND TIRED BUYING PARTS ONLINE AND IN THE ACTUAL STORE. BUT SERIOUSLY WE PAY FOR WHAT WE WANT. AND WE DON'T WANT A FAULTY CPU. THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT IF IT WAS YOUR FIRST TIME BUILDING A NEW COMPUTER AND SOME SELLER GAVE YOU A FAULTY CPU, WON'T U GET FRUSTRATED CAUSE U KEEP GETTING BSOD? I FINALLY HAVE TIME TO WRITE THIS WHOLE REVIEW BECAUSE I WAISTED SO MUCH MONEY REPLACING OTHER PARTS WHICH WERE ALL WORKING PERFECT, AND CAME TO REALISE THE PROBLEM WAS THE CPU!! GUYS JUST WATCH OUT, I THINK IM UNLUCKY TO GET A FAULTY CPU!!

Amazing product, beware of haters.

  Amazing. Lightning fast, handles new USB 3.1 Type C and DDR4 like a charm. Worth thw money for people looking for a future compatible build. All the 1 stars are BS, don't listen. They are not listing faults, just reasons that you should buy an older chip over this. The review section is to give a detailed review of the product, not to say that you should buy a different one. Otherwise every single review page could be littered with ""buy this phone it's better."" etc. Anyway, I reccomend thhis for anyone building something that they don't want to upgrade for years. And the default DDR4 support on most MoBos and the metal PCI-E lanes are a real catch.

","

  The next generation of Intel's processors, but just a marginal step up from the previous generation.  If you are like me, and running an AMD 720BE (or anything AMD), or anything older than a first generation i7, this is what to get.  Plus, any mobo you get for this will have an upgrade path available in a few years, as opposed to the LGA1150 motherboards.Also, BUYER BEWARE of early deals!  The MSRP is $350.  One company is requesting $433 for this processor - but pay attention to the shipping estimate!  It gives an estimate in September.  The processor will be readily available weeks before then.  Don't pay a premium to get it first - you'll pay more and get it last!

Good processor, awful integrated graphics. Does not support 4K monitors as of March 2016.
","

  This product does not support 4K monitors. Check Intel forum on HD 530 graphics to check all the problems people are having (google ""Intel HD Graphics 530 driver causing screen flickering""). I tried 3 different 4K monitors, DP cables, etc. I couldn't make it work with any of the 4K monitors. It was a very frustrating experience trying to figure out the problem as I was sure that Intel would have tested this thoroughly with many 4k monitors and motherboards.  I was very wrong. Look somewhere else if you plan to use the integrated graphics capability. I'm now using a NVIDIA Quadro K1200 and everything is working fine.

  Intel Skylake processors have many improvements over the previous generation, including DX12 support.  Downside is that it requires a new motherboard and RAM.  AnandTech has a nice deep dive if you want all the geeky details.This is replacing the Windows Media Center rig I built 5 years ago using the InfiniTV tuner.  Here’s the review I wrote including the specs.http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXV21TTXCOCJ/I’ve switched to using the HDHomeRun Prime network tuner which will have its own DVR solution by the end of the year.https://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/hd-homerun-dvr/Specs:Case:

Is it worth it? Maybe / Maybe not.
","

  It's a great chip with a lot of potential as the other reviewers have noted, if you are planning on and upgrade, But at the current prices I am not interested in it as it offers little to nothing in improvements for media development and anything that requires heavy processing power. 20 dollars more will get you a 5820,  6 cores and twelve threads, bump up the voltage and clock and it will run circles around a 6700k. Add  a bit(150) and you'll get bandwidth up the kazoo. Not worth the price I see Amazon vendors hawking it for...If your just a gamer it's just OK in my book.

  Intel released this chip about 4 years after Ivy Bridge 3770k and according to results on cpubenchmark.com 6700k has about 11k points@4GHz while 3770k has 9.6k@3.5GHzUsing simple math we can find that if 6700k was running @3.5GHz we would have a bit over 9.6k points.Maybe I'm missing something but it looks like Intel just increased clock speed and trying to sell exactly same chip 4 years later.For some reason power consumption has increased from 77W to 91W which is counter intuitive since we are always told that better lithography process tends to decrease power consumption.I'm very disappointed since I had higher expectations on Skylake performance. It doesn't look like it's worth spending money to upgrade from 3rd or 4th gen CPUs at this point.Update: added 1 start from 2 to 3 because this CPU supports VT-d

  Intel is quite content with mediocre speed improvements while changing 1 pin on the platform requiring new boards and new memory.  This is what having a monopoly allows you to do.  Zero competition from AMD along with shady business deals when AMD was competitive has allowed this to happen.
