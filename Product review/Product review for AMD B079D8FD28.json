Mainly for graphic design work, with a little light gaming on the side. I can see why Ryzens are taking off, awesome value and performance. This thing is still a little on the underpowered side for some of the work I do, but not a deal breaker. I went with this for the built-in graphics to start with, and planned to add a gpu later on. My buddy just gave me an old gtx 660 he had lying around, so it got a small upgrade already. If you need serious graphics and/or multi-thread computing power, go with a Ryzen a tier or two up.
