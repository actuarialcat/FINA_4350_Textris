Paired w/ a GTX 1070 SC, Auros B450M mobo and Vengeance LPX 3200mhz 2x 8GB ram (16 total) I am able to run all my favorite games (RDR2, Witcher 3, Warzone, Rainbow Six Siege, Fall Out 4 and 76 and WoW ) all on ultra or ultra/high settings at 60+ FPS no problem.I also heard this CPU is great for streaming and most work stations as well, definitely recommend it to anyone building their first rig or upgrading their current PC! Best of of all AMD is really out doing themselves and are making most of their Mobo's backwards compatible w/ this gen of cpu's and future cpu's!Edit- While I highly recommend this CPU, the 2600x is slightly better and only roughly $20 more so if u can afford maybe get the 2600x otherwise this gem will treat u well and do anything u ask of it!", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R32UMEQJ05NJ7K", "asin": {"original": "B07B41WS48", "variant": "B07B41WS48"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 28, 2020", "unix": 1603850400}, "name": "Spencer S.", "rating": 5, "title": "It good broski but it cuz it good broski", "review": "It good", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2ATD9BTMXGJ1J", "asin": {"original": "B07B41WS48", "variant": "B07B41WS48"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 25, 2020", "unix": 1603591200}, "name": "T.
