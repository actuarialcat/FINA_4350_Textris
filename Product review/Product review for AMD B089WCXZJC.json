I came back to get another one and as of 8/21/20 it is closer to $400 and would be worth it to grab a 3900x instead, going to a 3800x for $329 would feel like a smack to the face. I\u2019m not sure why prices aren\u2019t competitive with Micro Center on a more consistent basis. Bottom line on the cpu though is that it is excellent. Very future proof and if you look at year over year performance it is very similar to what you could expect on performance bump. Take Intel for example too, year over year on 10700k and 10900k we got more threads which is nice but speed was only a 100mhz bump. Whereas last years supply is still very relevant and a great buy. If you\u2019re just gaming be ok with 3600, 3600x and 3600xt. If you\u2019re a tiny bit scared to upgrade just to have 6 cores which benchmarks will show it hangs with 8+ cores, then the 3700x is just fine but if you\u2019re creative and getting busy then 8 cores is great, but at this current price I would consider the 3900x at $400-429.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3M7CO1LHHXJIQ", "asin": {"original": "B089WCXZJC", "variant": "B089WCXZJC"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2020", "date": {"date": "July 24, 2020", "unix": 1595556000}, "name": "Kulwinder", "rating": 5, "title": "Awesome", "review": "great cpu for gaming", "verified_purchase": true}]}
