Next to a 60 dollar case, 250Dollar GPU, 80 dollar PSU, and various technical things like fans and ram, this is definitely a budget friendly CPU that gets you into that pc market. Just don\u2019t expect to play anything too physically demanding.On BeamNG drive I can spawn about 4 vehicles before frames start to dive.Stormworks can play on low settings relatively well as of writing this review!And while I\u2019ve seen reviews stating this processor can 60fps GTA 5, I\u2019m here to say in my experience it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll get around 40-50 in city. Maybe 60 out of the city with minimal chaos, and that\u2019s on medium graphic settings which kinda bummed me out a bit as I had read this processor could do well on there, however my gpu could be to blame.ANYWAY, I think this CPU is the perfect price for the performance, it\u2019s also overclockable however I have not done so myself as my motherboard doesn\u2019t support it.Be wise in pairing this with a good GPU as the processor is definitely weak without one to help back it up.", "verified_purchase": false}, {"id": "R1PHI9MDY667DC", "asin": {"original": "B0741DN383", "variant": "B0741DN383"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2020", "date": {"date": "July 16, 2020", "unix": 1594864800}, "name": "Kimberly", "rating": 4, "title": "Goody", "review": "Good for it's price", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R1BI1X6IQX9VRB", "asin": {"original": "B0741DN383", "variant": "B0741DN383"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020", "date": {"date": "July 8, 2020", "unix": 1594173600}, "name": "Andrew Koresh", "rating": 3, "title": "A good cpu for the price...", "review": "I bought this cpu in 2017 and it is still working but as of now im starting to have problems with it. it worked great until it started overheating and decreasing in performance.
