I\u2019ve never received a flawed intel cpu and I\u2019ve built PCs with them since the 8088. They seem to get easier to install all the time. The notches make it nearly fool proof. I\u2019m not a gamer, I have no need to push the limits. I boot up the new build and it\u2019s been running constantly for 2 wks now without any hiccups. My gen 2 i5 was showing its age, but still runs ok. Just going into retirement I figured I\u2019d build a new desktop while I can afford it. I expect it may be the last pc I\u2019ll need to build since my needs are pretty basic. I probably could have gone with a lower level cpu but I expect this will carry me forward a bit further.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "ROTPWD5ID58T9", "asin": {"original": "B086MN38Q2", "variant": "B086MN38Q2"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 5, 2020", "unix": 1604541600}, "name": "Tanya", "rating": 5, "title": "Yes!", "review": "Running great!
