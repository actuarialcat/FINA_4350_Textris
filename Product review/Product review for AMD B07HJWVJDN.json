This is supposed to be a use but in like new condition, The APU even came with thermal paste already applied, I don't think processors get beat up too much so they should still look in pretty good shape I guess this one looks remarkably brand new and I can't wait to start using it, I've heard good things about this chip and it makes me happy. Updated 10/2020 I don't have many pc games I had built pc for family's kids but only did one for me in 2008 and it still works but I recently built one for me this year and forgot much of my teaching, plus I'm 57 yo.I love mass effect series so when andromeda came out I got it well it didn't work so now with this APU it works fine on low settings other games like Home world and Warhamer 40K play fine and all that without a stand alone video card just the vaga onboard I think that's very good.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2N1PFEIJOF98O", "asin": {"original": "B07HJWVJDN", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020", "date": {"date": "August 29, 2020", "unix": 1598666400}, "name": "Kelvin", "rating": 5, "title": "Perfect budget option", "review": "Blazing fast desktop performance (Expected).
