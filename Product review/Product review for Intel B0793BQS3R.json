Know what you are buying, rebinned, slower Coffee Lake", "review": "Everyone knows that Intel's Pentium Gold and Celeron chips are just rebinned variants of their more expensive products. In other words, this is just a Coffee Lake Core i3/i5/i7 with bad cores and cache sized down to a Dual Core CPU with hyper threading.In other words, don't expect this to be on par with any of their other offerings of the same generation. That being said, I'll be the first to admit that underlying microarchitecture is the same as their other chips so you'll see solid performance under moderate workloads. It wont be top tier but it will do the job.How do I use this CPU? In an ESXi host, and it does quite well! I'm running four to five virtual machines and a time and it has no problem staying responsive and cool.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2A2LMKLHTE8P1", "asin": {"original": "B0793BQS3R", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020", "date": {"date": "June 15, 2020", "unix": 1592186400}, "name": "Ryan M", "rating": 3, "title": "Underpowered And Underwhelming", "review": "A bit underpowered, even for the price.Struggles with even moderate with loads.Ended up exchanging for an i3 and quite a bit happier with that.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "RDJ77X4KCAECH", "asin": {"original": "B0793BQS3R", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2020", "date": {"date": "May 26, 2020", "unix": 1590458400}, "name": "Amazon Customer", "rating": 5, "title": "Good value", "review": "Good processor, great value for the price and plays games really good , j\u2019d recomend", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2WP2EYYX229YK", "asin": {"original": "B0793BQS3R", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020", "date": {"date": "February 12, 2020", "unix": 1581472800}, "name": "Susan in NH", "rating": 5, "title": "works very well!!", "review": "works very well!!", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3MID1P84RYI25", "asin": {"original": "B0793BQS3R", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020", "date": {"date": "January 8, 2020", "unix": 1578448800}, "name": "Antoine Nious", "rating": 5, "title": "Perfect for Nas Server.", "review": "I actually using this product for a personal nas server.
