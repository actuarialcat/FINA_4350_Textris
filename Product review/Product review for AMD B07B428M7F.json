I use it in my Plex Media Server and even with 4 clients streaming 1080P video (3 of them transcoding video and audio on the fly) plus 2 shows recording on its DVR, this CPU rarely breaks 50% utilization.Though it was designed as a desktop CPU, it actually makes a great server CPU because of its stability, which is further improved because it supports ECC RAM.In 2 years of usage, it has never crashed.My uptimes are measured in months, with restarts only when an OS update requires it.Highly recommend AMD and Ryzen, will definitely buy again.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R34STM9M6G4385", "asin": {"original": "B07B428M7F", "variant": "B07B428M7F"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 7, 2020", "unix": 1604714400}, "name": "Marcia Daigle", "rating": 5, "title": "Recommend", "review": "Grandson ordered and likes", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R32L99QE3WD5EZ", "asin": {"original": "B07B428M7F", "variant": "B07B428M7F"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 6, 2020", "unix": 1604628000}, "name": "Mike", "rating": 5, "title": "Great gaming performance for price", "review": "Stays cool during gamer because of the awesome looking cooler. 8 cores for 213 dollars is great value way better than intel.

Never really checked how hot my last one got, which was a Ryzen 3 1200. This one idles between 38-43 and gets at low 50-60 when being used heavily. Really nice change while I'm in the process of switching all of my low end parts out. Do beware that if you have an old board that doesn't come with mounting brackets that you will need to purchase them separately. Wasn't aware they didn't come with the processor and had to wait a few more days to get those delivered.", "verified_purchase": true}]}
