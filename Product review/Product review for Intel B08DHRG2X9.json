With that out of the way I'll try to provide enough information to help both crowds decide if this CPU is worth your money.MY SPECS:Intel Core i9 10850k @5.1GhzG.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 3600mhz CL16-16-16-39NVIDIA RTX 2080ti Founders EditionMSI Z490 MEGNZXT Kraken X73 360mm AIOEVGA Supernova 850W Modular PSU4TB 860 EVO + 2TB XPG NVMe +1TB Sabrent Rocket 4.0Thermaltake View 51 Full TowerAsus TUF VG27QM 1080p 280hz MonitorGAMING:When it comes to 1080p 240hz gaming as of now, these 10th gen intel CPU's are unmatched for the price. With the announcement of Zen 3, this statement may very well be proven false, but for the immediate time being this is as good as it gets. The counterpart to this CPU would be the Ryzen 3900x and having seen my friends benchmarks in games like Apex Legends, Overwatch, COD MW/Warzone and Valorant, I can reliably say that the i9 10850k/i9 10900k easily achieves higher frames overall. It gets to a point where the i9 10850k can give an additional 20-30+ frames higher in some games when overclocked to 5.1 or 5.2ghz with low latency ram. 1440p gaming narrows the gap a little and will be more GPU bound but again the 10850k will give out 5-10+% higher performance depending on the game title.WORKSTATION USE:As a 3D artist who also likes to play competitive games, it can get a little confusing when you're looking for a CPU that can comfortably provide both experiences flawlessly. From the past PC's I've built, I always favored going for higher core count CPU's in order to have the best experience for my workstation needs. With 10th/11th Gen Intel and Zen 3, the gap narrowed pretty significantly. When it comes to Modeling, Lighting, Texturing and Rendering, I can comfortably say I've had no issues with Maya, Blender, V-Ray, Arnold, Keyshot and several other industry standard applications. The render speeds aren't as fast as the Ryzen counterparts but they get the job done quite well. As with most modern renderer's it'll also rely on your Ram and GPU to keep up with your CPU. I would recommend using an RTX 2070 or above along with DDR4 3600mhz ram with CL16-16-16-39 Timings or better (this is for gaming as well).CONCLUSION:If you want the best mix for high refresh gaming and workstation needs right now, buy this CPU. Otherwise if you can wait a few months, check out the Zen 3 CPU's and compare the benchmarks. As of now I'm very satisfied with this CPU for all my needs and hopefully this review provided enough information to help you decide.", "verified_purchase": false}, {"id": "R17AT0SO2T4E8S", "asin": {"original": "B08DHRG2X9", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 2, 2020", "unix": 1604282400}, "name": "TeamMatthewsTransportationLLC", "rating": 5, "title": "10 core i-9 Build Project No.1", "review": "Awesome Speed I built my first computer with th 10 core i-9 Processor on the all new MSI Z490 God Like Motherboard an it came out Great im just waiting for a chance to get the MSI 3090 24GBGraphic Card so I can really test its true power.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3F1BLHWW4OU2H", "asin": {"original": "B08DHRG2X9", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 29, 2020", "unix": 1603936800}, "name": "Penella Maharaj", "rating": 5, "title": "Great CPU!", "review": "Bought this for a build I'm doing.

I own 3 monitors as I am a multitasker, and this doesn't even sweat with my Castle 280EX cooling it down.
