Excellent processor
","

  I did a small upgrade on my system, including this processor.My computer is primarily used for compiling Visual Basic and C++, with some play of ancient games and managing some movies and files.This step's through far better (and faster).  I am now able to ""run through"", and not just go step by step.  Recompiling videos takes about a quarter the time as before.The two changes were going from SATA II to SATA III (double speed on the SSD, not directly connected to the processor), and going from an older i3 3.0 GHz dual to this one.The difference is tremendous.If you want to do gaming, get an i5 or better.  This can get the job done, but you will appreciate having spent the extra money.If you only do games from 2014 and before, this one will more than make the cut.  If you work with numbers and scripts, this CPU is more than you need, but you'll appreciate the extra.I would recommend this to any moderate end computer user.

Best bang for your buck

  For the price you cannot shake your head at this CPU. Offers great performance in older games when matched with a GTX 950, runs very cool, the stock CPU fan looks undersized but it does a great job of keeping up and with the case open next to me I haven't heard the fan yet. I'm hoping someday to upgrade my system to an i7, but this chip is doing everything I need it to do right now.

  You get what you pay for normally. I bought 2 of these for some HTPC builds and they work amazing. very impressed with the i3 under 100 dollar pricetage and performance and spunkiness of the CPU. now don't go thinking this can handle some intense gaming (obviously paired up with a graphics card) or even heavy video editor software. It would definitely be chugging for awhile as it is not an i5 or i7 by any stretch of the imagination. But it is perfect for the budget builds that would do light gaming as well as some video streaming and HTPC style workload.

  For the average user, it is great. It has plenty of processing power and it does not generate much heat, which means the fans do not have to run fast (and loud) to keep the system functioning. The integrated graphics technology will work well for the average person that browses the web, watches movies, reads email, types documents, etc. If you are building a new PC with a relatively limited budget, this is definitely worth a look.I am not sure how well this will work for modern gamers. Most of the games I play are either old or are much harder on the CPU than graphics. I tried this on one of the more CPU intensive games and and the integrated graphics were pretty bad when the CPU was strained. However, when I stuck an old video card in it, performance was great. The CPU had no problems. I just don't know how the CPU will handle some of the more recent games that are hard on both the CPU and graphics.

The budget processor that could
","

  After my previous system burned out, I looked into building a budget-friendly microATX gaming PC. I considered going with a non-K i5, but after reading tons of reviews online and considering the fact that the 6100 was about $100 cheaper than the cheapest i5, I decided to choose the 6100. I am thoroughly impressed with its performance for such a good price. I had previously owned an i5-4690K OC'd to 4.1GHz with 8GB DDR3 memory. For considerably cheaper than my previous rig, I was able to snag the 6100, a microATX motherboard, and 16GB of DDR4. I also upgraded my SSD to a 256gb Samsung 850 EVO. My machine feels noticeably faster now. I am unsure of which part accounts for this, or if all of them working together is the culprit, but whatever the case may be it feels like greased lightning. I paired this with a Zotac GTX 1060 and have been getting 55-60FPS consistently at 1080p in The Witcher 3 with the CPU hitting a max of about 46C. I am also getting consistent 100FPS in Dwarf Fortress 2014 at a fortress population of 240 with little to no fortress or game optimization present. Anyone who has played DF knows how ludicrous that is. My previous rig, with its overclocked i5, could handle a pop of 120 before slowing down to 60FPS, and ground to a halt at anything over 160.Overall, this is quite possibly the best budget CPU out there. Don't let the fact that it only has two physical cores scare you: it's tough enough to handle anything you throw at it.

Save the planet or a tree or use less gas..

  This 6th Gen I3 3.7GHZ Is almost 90% faster than my old 2nd Gen Sandy bridge 3.1GHZ processor.  The memory speeds went from 1.333GHZ to 2.133GHZ so that would help as well. So basically it is like getting an older I5 system. But it also costs 50% more than my old I3 system. Computer prices are supposed to go down as time goes by but not in this case I suppose even though HD prices have dropped but not the CPU or RAM prices. My old I3 let me do all the things I wanted to do without any problems by adding more memory so the CPU was not a bottle neck anyway even with watching movies and browsing and having 500 windows open at the same time, But the best thing about this is, the electricity usage on this is under 5 watts under normal operations while with sandy bridge it was 15 to 20 watts with it hitting 60 watts under full load and this also hits around 60 watts but runs at twice as fast. Also while watching a movie it still stays under 5 watts, something else I noticed it the CPU usage where it stays around 800mhz while CPU load gets upto 50%.. While with sandy it would actually go to 2GHZ when CPU load got to 50%. So I am sure over all my electric bill will be much lower now. The DDR4 RAM shows as using under 2watts while with the DDR3 it was almost 5 watts. And in a decade I can recoup the extra cost I paid for this system in saved electric bills.. But anything to save some gas for now I suppose. The extra speeds might come in handy I am sure but none of the games and such I use used up the sandy bridge processor at 100% except in a few rare cases so this should last a while. The electricity usage was why I got tis instead of the 8 core AMD which was only like $20 more but the 8 core AMD would still end up cheaper over all and faster. So it was a trade off like getting a more efficient appliance by paying twice as much. What we do to save the planet even if others are hell bent on destroying it. I tried the Intel lower power later gen CPU's but those would not be sufficient for multi tasking even if they used far less power. This on the other hand does use less power until you need it. So that made a huge difference. Compared to the Intel of 2 decades ago I am impressed by such things. From other reviews I see that this can also throttle up the juice to do pretty much anything you want for most things so I would say this is the sweet spot for the vast majority of uses. The prices could be cheaper though and I bet once the new AMD CPU's hit, things will get interesting. But until then we have the I3 6100.. Spending $10 more for an extra 100mhz? What ever for.. At 3.7GHZ, 100 MHz is like less than 5%.. And $30 more for 3.9HGZ? Why not just get the I5 then.. At that point you start to look at over clocking the memory as well and well soon you double the price of the system and then you want liquid cooling and nitro boosters and RAM based storage and and and....

Amazing CPU for the Money, Can Do Video Editing!
","

  This is one of the best, if not the best, value gaming CPUs.  It kicks ass in most or all games and I notice no frame drops/bottlenecking unless the CPU is being stressed to 100% constantly (which is SUPER rare).  I can even do some video editing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC without any noticeable hiccups (EDIT: Although render times will obviously suffer a lot).  Best thing is that if you want to upgrade, this gives you a solid upgrade path to the (hopefully compatible with Z170 chipsets) upcoming Intel 7th Gen (Kaby Lake) processors and if not, the current Skylake platform to an i7-6700k.EDIT: I forgot to mention that this CPU is overclockable on certain Z170 mobos via the BCLK (base clock), providing even more value and performance!  You may have to downgrade the UEFI in order to tinker with the BCLK.

Plenty Fast
","

  Average CPU Mark: 5429 passmark; Single Thread Rating: 2103 passmarkThis is a dual core processor, and so a quad core will be faster over all, but not necessarily for a single core, because to reduce power Intel reduces the single core clock speed. If you're the type of person who only keeps a few browser tabs open, works on one project at a time, and doesn't do intensive multi-core applications (like games, graphics, and/or rendering) then this processor will be plenty fast.An i5 or i7 will be much faster, but why waste your money if all you're going to do is browse the net, do emails, post some FB comments, or write a letter. In fact if those things are all you're doing than even this processor is overkill. You should just buy a good Pentium or Celeron for basic computing. (If this is your need, then buy this processor instead: https://smile.amazon.com/Intel-BX80662G4400-Pentium-Processor-FCLGA1151/dp/B015VPX05A/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1482277126&sr=1-1&keywords=B015VPX05A)(FYI: I've tested this processor with older games, like SIMs 4 or WoW, and as long as I kept the video settings reasonable the games ran super smooth. But plan on it bogging down in the capital cities in WoW as it can't handle that much graphic information.)

  Very power efficient, and runs cool. The specs are as outlined so I won't bother going into performance. My CPU installed and benchmarked just fine on my GA-H170N-WIFI motherboard.The standard Intel HSF is included. If you're not overclocking, and you have sufficient airflow in your case, this will be adequate for your needs. It installs very easily and has thermal paste pre-applied (be careful not to smear it when you handle the HSF, as it's packed unprotected). I will note however that the fan is noisy and has a terrible tonality (a high-pitched whine that audibly changes when the fan speeds up or slows down). The sound was unacceptable so I switched it out for the Noctua NH-L9I, which I've also reviewed elsewhere. It provided equivalent cooling with much less noise. I downgraded this review by one star for the fan noise.

Powerful little CPU that was the perfect touch to my most recent build
","

  The i3-6100 is a powerful little dual core processor with hyper-threading that allows it to compete and surpass most similarly priced quad-core processors. It uses the 1151 socket which allows for easy upgrade into something even more powerful in the future.I used this as the core of my intel based computer for Video Gaming and rendering 3D models and video in Blender. I paired it with a GTX 960 video card and this duo has handled everything I've thrown at it without breaking a sweat. It runs Fallout 4 on ultra and has had absolutely no problem with No Man's Sky.The stock cooler was a breeze to install and has kept the processor nice and cool. The pre-applied thermal paste on the heatsink has been more than adequate thus far (though I'll probably clean it off and apply some Arctic Silver later just for my own peace of mind).While there are certainly more powerful processors on the market today, the i3-6100 is definitely the best on offer in its price range at this moment. It also has the benefit of allowing you the flexibility of upgrading to a much more powerful processor in the future.All of my previous builds have been AMD based and this little guy is certainly making me question my allegiance.It was relatively inexpensive, powerful, and the 1151 socket will let me upgrade to something much more powerful in the future should I so desire. Definitely happy with this purchase.

  Gigabyte Motherboard Micro ATX DDR4 LGA 1151 GA-H110M-S2H GSM: First, let me say that all of the advertising hype is true. This is a top-quality MB.

An unexpected feature was a 3rd SATA port. Note: this is a very small MB.  It fits in an Mini-ITX type case. I am completely satisfied.

  Came to me in good and working condition. I will admit that I dropped this CPU before I even put it into my system (EXTREMELY sensitive hands) but it still worked because the plastic saved it. I exchanged the CPU cooler for an Arctic freezer 11 which cools it just fine.PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TEMPERATURES WERE MONITORED IN THIS CASE: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161UXX9W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3THIS CASE HAS NO FANS.On an 85 degrees Celsius night, the temps hover around~ 60-65 degrees Celsius. Since I'm only a gamer for now, that is REALLY good.Processor doesn't seem to overload from a few applications running like my old AMD APU did. That was also a dual core.Would buy again if I did manage to drop it. :)

  It is a great budget CPU for gamers but do not expect the best performance when it comes to new AAA Games. Some games are bottle necked by this lil beast but it is perfect for games like TF2, CS:GO, Rainbow 6 Siege, Rocket League, Payday 2 and Minecraft. I have tried to play Battlefield 1 on this and it is unbearable, GTA V is robbed of some frames but the game is playable at 1080p.If you are on the tightest budget, I would buy this CPU, but if you are like me and start playing games, Miscreated for example, that require a Quad Core CPU, I recommend buying an i5 or a Ryzen 5 CPU.

  A great chip for a budget build, plenty of speed with hyper threading (a rarity for Intel chips without an i7 logo emblazoned on them) and a piece of cake to install.

  Bought for my first PC build recently. Paired it with a GTX 950, 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It works pretty well. For general Windows tasks, it multitasks without any issues. For gaming, it gets a pretty good framerate on Fallout 4 at high settings. Also, don't waste money on an aftermarket CPU cooler or fancy thermal paste for this processor. The stock heatsink (which has thermal paste preapplied) and fan keeps it at the 30-40 degree level without issue, and is quiet enough for my tastes.

Worth every penny, Perfect for a budget build
","

  I don't regret saving my money and going with an I3 instead of the more expensive Core i5.Why?I don't play games and don't need much for what I do. For what I need, this is perfect.Never once have I felt this processor was slow or that I should have went with the Core i5.I actually upgraded because my 7 year old Core 2 Quad Q6600 was taking forever to encode video.Encoding 1080p to MPEG2 would take 3-5 hours. Now it takes less than an hour.I was surprised to find that somehow Intel managed to make installing a CPU extremely easy.I didn't even notice any pins on this thing and it's way smaller than my old Core 2 Quad.I'm using the stock cooler and my PC is pretty much dead silent.Totally painless install in every way too.The only problem i've had is issues with the onboard video.I would get random black lines in Firefox and other apps for no reason. Barely noticeable.After upgrading to beta drivers the problem is gone.I'm seriously impressed at how much faster my computer is now compared to before.Even my solid state drive is running much faster. It sure is nice being able to boot up within 20 seconds.One thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE is Data Execution Protection (DEP in BIOS).Whenever I enable this nonsense it causes major crashes in both Windows 7 or Windows 10.It usually ends up with a program saying ""This program has closed"".I had to disable this ""feature"" in software and in the BIOS to keep from having my ancient programs crash non-stop.

  I wanted to upgrade to the LGA 1151 platform, but I didn't want to jump to a Core i5 or Core i7 right away. I debated going with the lower Pentium G4400 or getting this Core i3, and in the end I got the i3, as I figured I could wait longer to get a i7, and I can re-use this in a secondary build down the road. I play a variety of games, such as Rocket League, GTA V, Far Cry, Total War, CSGO, etc, and all of these are completely playable, which I am happy about. I also do a bit of Twitch streaming and video editing, and while video rendering isn't as fast as an i7, it still works pretty good for now, and I am able to stream to Twitch (720p, 30fps, 2000kbps) on this thing as well, although not necessarily at the same time as playing GTA V for example without a bit of issues.For the price, this really is a nice CPU.

Ultra cool running fast CPU/GPU exceptional value for near silent very low profile Mini ITX HTPC builds.
","

  Just completed 2 Mini ITX HTPC builds/rebuilds with these new Skylake chips. Wow! these units edge out the performance of my nearly 3 year old Ivy Bridge I7-3770S and I5-3570K builds for less than half the cost. Now and 3 years ago I used the best available Asrock ITX boards to enhance what I want in these units: feature rich power HTPC's that can run nearly silently with ultra low profile CPU fans without burning up. With the previous builds I had to use the motherboard's built in controls to slightly underclock the CPU's to get the thermal and quiet noise level patterns I wanted. Now I have used 2 new Fatal1ty Z170 Gaming-ITX/ac boards with thirteen buck Rosewill RCX-Z775-LP 80mm Sleeve Low Profile CPU Coolers that without underclocking run the new I3's quietly 10-15 Celsius lower than the old builds. Plus I now have HTPC's that have HDMI 2.0 ports that can run 4K video at 60Hz.I am not a gamer, so I also used the Fatal1ty Z170 Gaming-ITX/ac boards to get the new USB3.1 and C ports and upgraded Audio. I suspect that gamers on a budget could put the cash saved on this Skylake I3 into a good Graphics board and small SSD - and still have a rocking machine. Recommend: Don't skimp on the motherboard though.Update: 5/18/2016: Just saw some old comments/questions: Yes, I am using onboard graphics only. My HTPC enclosures are only about 8X8X2.5 inches. In these tiny boxes the older I7 & I5 Ivy Bridge temperatures ran up fan speeds and noise too much for my tastes while watching video, so I artificially under clocked them in the bios to reduce the thermal profiles and quiet the fans to unnoticeable beyond 12-18 inches away from the units. The I3 Skylake builds run quietly as HTPC's without bios setting modifications. The only time fan speeds and noise increase are during maintenance tasks such as virus scans and OS update installs which run quickly with the I3's.  But for my personal preference for snappy maintenance, the G4400 or G4500 Skylake dual-cores might have worked well as HTPC's for me. I did build a totally silent HTPC using an Asrock Q1900DC-ITX board which includes an Intel Quad-Core Processor J1900 with fanless heat sink and built in DC/DC power for cheap. It runs well as a HTPC, but it's pokey running maintenance tasks, so like the I3's better

  I admit that I was incredibly skeptical about using this CPU in a gaming PC. I'd seen reviews and heard people talk up a storm about this chips capabilities.I will admit that I was wrong about it. This chip performs incredibly well!I decided to build an HTPC for my TV as well as travel. I can fit it into my ASUS laptop backpack which makes bringing it to a friends incredibly easy to do.

Fantastic for when you're on a budget!
","

  If you're on a tight budget but still want to play your games, then this is the CPU for you.Due to Intels' hyper-threading, this i3 is treated as if it has four cores instead of just two. However, I still suggest getting an i5 if you can fit it into your budget.But if you can't, no worries, the i3-6100 is a powerful champ. And you can always upgrade to a better cpu later if you want.

Best CPU you can get on a budget (just be sure to get a discrete GPU if you're gaming)
","

  I gotta say, I didn't think a $120ish i3 would impress me. I got it because I wanted to build a computer without breaking the bank, and reviews were kind to this little chip. Well, for like 95% of purposes, it not only does the job, but it does it WELL. Once I got my system built, I decided to stress-test it by doing things like video encoding, moving files, Excel calculations from last year's Quant class (at my college, quantitative chemical analysis is a very Excel-heavy course) and some gaming. Well, obviously with more highly threaded tasks, you're going to get more performance out of four physical cores (like an i5) and even more out of four physical cores with hyper-threading (like an i7), and it did reach mid 90's in terms of CPU utilization during the video encoding task. That said, the stock fan still managed to keep it cool during that task, which is nice. With everything else, it felt very quick- at no point did it feel like I was experiencing slowdown or anything. The only time it started to slow down a bit was when I was multitasking, with several downloads running simultaneously, plus moving files between drives and streaming music via Spotify. And surprisingly, it could run older games very well, even running newer games at low settings, but 1080p and playable framerates. But if you want to enable more graphical bells and whistles, my recommendation would be to get a discrete GPU, as the integrated graphics are respectable in comparison to older generations of Intel IGPs, but nothing special at all in the overall scheme of things.

I only run a single monitor and run light to intense workloads each day through this processor. I bought this chip because I wanted the platform that was current gen and up-gradable. Since kabylake will run off the same socket type and use ddr4 I'll be able to upgrade in the future but as it stands I have to say I'm in no hurry at all. I'm able to play games off of steam no problem with no studering or clipping that you'd get with a cpu bottleneck. I'm able to use word and excel with no problems and my system runs fast with no hesitations that my ssd might be my only system fault and that's pretty amazing when you're running a dual core processor in today's system. For $100 the 6100 is almost a steal for new tech that has upgradablitity and support for the future.

A Good Option for a Budget Processor
","

  Let me begin by saying this is a great processor and comes at a cheap price.  Intel has been great with providing reliable, power efficient, and performance capable processors.  This i3-6100 is no exception to that.  This processor offers;1) A much better price to performance ratio than the more expensive i5/i7 skylake processors2) Runs cool even with just the stock (included) cooler during most gaming situations, at least in my experience with it3) Hyper-threading technology to allow excellent single core performance (processor has 2 physical cores with 2 threads each)4) A low power requirement of 51W means that those of you with smaller power supplies looking to get a Skylake CPU can5) Support for DDR4 memory if you are looking to make a RAM upgrade as wellA few criticisms of this processor (in my opinion);1)If you play to use this in a budget GAMING build, with weaker components in it, you might be better off saving $50 and just getting a Pentium g440 as it is still a respectable chip for a budget gaming PC and you won't loose that much performance by giving up hyper-threading in gamingPentium g4400 - 

Intel BX80662G4400 Pentium Processor G4400 3.3 GHz FCLGA1151

2)Those looking to cut money in a more expensive PC build by taking the i3-6100 over an i5 chip should be made aware that that performance lost by giving up the two extra physical cores in the i5 will be noticeable.  The benefit of having 4 physical cores in the i5 is huge especially in things like media editing and content creating.  I made the choice to skip out on the i5 in my rig and go with this i3 and all I can say is that I wish I had went with the i5 (I create video content for both school and leisure on YouTube).  The amount of time saved rendering out each video with the i5 would have been well worth my money.  If between this i3-6100 and a Skylake i5, I would say spend the extra now and not have to regret it in the future, or spend much more to upgrade.Hope this helped you make a decision on this processor

this chip is 95% or more as good as an i5 or i7 of the same generation (for gaming)
","

  for even high-end gaming, this chip is 95% or more as good as an i5 or i7 of the same generation, for 50% and 33% of the price, respectively.paired with a 960GTX and even moderately clocked DDR4 ram, this will play most games on ultra on 1080p, namely:- CS GO- Any Blizzard game, including OverwatchNote that this chip, along with others of the same generation, will benefit much more than previous generation intel chips from higher clocked RAM.It's no longer just a 1-5% increase in FPS, but more like 5-20% increase.An SSD is still a much more bang-for-buck upgrade than faster RAM, though.Only difference with this generation is that faster RAM comes in at a close second for best bang-for-buck upgrade.

When In Doubt go Intel
","

  Friends..let us reason together. Let us cast aside specs on boxes and video reviews from shady individuals with agendas. I searched hi and low on mountains and through valleys. I scoured the depths of the internet doing research on what processor I should get for my very first budget gaming build. Hear me friends!! I almost..almost I say..almost was hoodwinked into buying that amd fx 6300. If you haven't figured it out yet I'm about to figure it out for you. Thank me by pushing that little helpful review button. I know 6 or even 8 cores of blazing fast amd processor a budget friendly price is almost too much to pass up..but I urge you to pass it up and never look back. If you don't remember anything else I write seal this within your brain housing group. Architecture is what matters my brethren and sistren. Intel has the faster, more efficient architecture. So to make a looooong story short...the dual core i3 6100 with its 3.7 smokes a six core amd fx 6300. Forget about over clocking it....forget that it has 6 cores...forget the pricetag. Forget it and buy the i3 6100 if that's your budget limit. Now pair that with a gtx 960 and enjoy seamless 1080 gaming at reasonable frame rates at medium or better. Hardcore gamers will need better. Think about your build. If you get that old lame amd chip you gotta get that old lame motherboard and ddr3 ram. All you can upgrade to is the 8 core fx chips which still have that lame architecture. You buy the i3 skylake chip and the 1151 motherboard and ddr4 ram and you have multiple amazing options for upgrading the processor when you get all that money. Don't be a sucker. Don't be an Amd fanboy. You will be the laughing stock of all your PC gaming nerd friends(if you even have friends.)

Mixed up processors
","

  I ordered this processor twice directly from Amazon and twice received the wrong one. First I received a G3240 and then I received a G1820. Both processors had an i3-6100 label covering the real label which showed the actual processor. There is some kind of mixup going on.The processor should be good, if you can actually receive the right one.

Proper Performance...Affordable Pricetag
","

  Processor is a great budget performer for the money. I consider the i3 processors to be intel's triple core in terms of relative performance. Currently being used in my test bench system and is capable of running two virtual machines simultaneously  using Vmware.The stock intel heatsinks do however appear to be getting thinner/smaller every new generation...as in less and less metal is being used in their manufacture. Now as the processor manufacturing process shrinks it generates less heat, but the heatsinks are to be shrinking along with it. Not exactly sure how it affects performance as I am currently using an Arctic Freezer i11 for cooling (it really ins't necessary but it came from a previous build.Testbench SetupCPU: Core i3 6100MBD: MSI B150M Pro-VDRAM: Crucial Ballistic Sport LT DDR4 4GBx2 2400MT/s (it operates at 2133 as that is the spec on the mem controller)GPU: Onboard GraphicsPSU: Corsar CX 430WStorage: Mushkin Callisto 64GB (SSD) + Hitachi Deskstar 2TB (HDD)Case: Cooler Master Elite 330Processor is great for my current usage scenario....when it does change (increase), I will most likely skip the i5 and go straight to the i7

Solid CPU!
","

  A lot of people maybe worried that this will bottleneck when paired with certain GPUs just cause it's an i3 but make no mistake, when paired with a 1060 this little beast doesn't bottleneck at all! With a 1060 it runs most games at 2k/60/high settings just fine with CPU usage around 70-75%. If you're wanting a CPU for around $120 this is bout the best you'll get. It will ""bottleneck"" when playing certain games no matter what GPU you have like Witcher 3 and other very CPU heavy games but even the i5 6600 bottlenecks with some of those.In short if you plan on streaming, film editing, or playing a lot of open world games, you'll best option maybe to downgrade ur GPU one level and get an i5-6600. However, in most cases this will be the best you'll need and even in open world games you can expect 1080/60 max settings with this little beast provided you have a good GPU.

Budget cpu, terrible cooler.
","

  I know this wont be a verified review but to form credibility i just want to state that i recieved this as a christmas present. My spec are as follows:Gtx 750 ti16gb 2400mhz ramEVGA 500w psuMsi b150500gb hhd.Moving forward with the product review. This is a great little cpu. It is bottlenecked by my graphics card (or hhd, not sure), which is a suprising feat for a dual core processor. The 4 logical processors really makes this unit a bang for the buck. My library consists of the witcher 3, battlefield 4 and hardline, arma 3, squad, rb6 siege, total war warhammer, skyrim, shadow of mordor, civ 5, aoe 2 and 3, tomb raider 2013, fallout 3, and the AC humble bundle, most of which perform at 60 frames at high settings. Whether youre looking to game or build a work desktop this processor will get the job done at a minimal strike to the budget. The only qualm i have of this unit it the cooler. I understand its stock, but i cant help but feel like im on an airplane when my computer is running. It gets so loud when im playing. Im happy i invested in nice headphones. My first upgrade would be to the cooler and i urge anyone who is buying this to save 30 bucks more and buy a decent air cooler. Besides that, this processor does the job at more than adequate.

The best for a budget computer :D
","

  Wanted to build my own gaming computer, but not one that'll put me deeper into debt than I already am. So, I was trying to research everywhere to see what can I get for a good budget and still be able to play some of the newest and more demanding games, and this was it! It works so perfectly fine with everything in my build so far and I love it :D I can proudly say I have my own Skylake computer <3 I probably don't play as intensive and demanding games that are out there anyways, but hey, I'm able to play all the games I want A LOT more nicely and smoothly and also able to do so much more multitasking on the computer than was possible on my 5yr laptop xD Love Love Love you Intel!

Best Budget CPU and best upgrade path.

  This is one of the best CPus out there. Look if your starting out, get this CPU. What is great with this CPU is that you have a great upgrade path.Also the new Intel CPU KabyLake will you use the same socket as Skylake. So you get a nice great priced CPU and a great upgrade path later down the road.

A great CPU for getting into PC gaming
","

  A great CPU for getting into PC gaming. For newer games, if you have a powerful enough graphics card, the limitations of the i3 aren't terrible, unless you really need a 60+FPS experience. In older or less demanding games, this is more than enough (At least for me, with an rx 480).
