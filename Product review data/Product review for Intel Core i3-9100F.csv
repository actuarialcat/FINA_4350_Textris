If you're gaming/doing anything non-Production, buy this.
","

  I can tell you from personal experience, the difference between this $80 CPU and the $520 9th Gen i9 9900K is... $440.  Framerate gain at 1440p was ROUGHLY 2-3 frames per second, small enough to be in the window of error.  I cannot imagine a consumer use case where you're actually going to get ANY use out of the beefier CPUs besides shaving a couple minutes off a video encode (that's encoding, not decoding, aka ""watching stuff"").  Put that $440 into a GPU upgrade and you'll REALLY be helping yourself.  This CPU smokes, and sips power to boot.Do not buy into the hypebeast.  You don't need to spend $950 on a PC before you even get to the graphics card.  Be smart.  Don't throw money into the wastebasket.  Use it better.

Good for World of Warcraft

  The main reason I bought this was for playing Word of Warcraft.  It is doing very well at playing World of Warcraft.  No integrated graphics but that doesn't matter since I am using graphics card.  the only negative is no quick sync is available for video transcoding.  Something to think about if you do that kind of thing.

Great value for the buck
","

  Ok with the Intel lineup if you want to go and spend a ton of cash on a CPU, np. They got you covered well. If you want to save cash and get a strong CPU, then here's the deal.  I replaced my old 3rd Gen Intel I7-3770 with this one which bench marked a bit better than it. I got a 8th/9th Gen Motherboard to go with it.  Now I figure I have this for a year or two and then upgrade as needed to an Intel I5/I7/I9 9th Gen as needed. But for now my I3-9100F has plenty of power. There is no graphics included in the CPU so you'll need a graphics card. Then again most PC builders always get a Graphics card so this won't be a deal breaker. So, I'd snap this one up if you're an ""Intel-Guy"" but I'm sure if you can handle the setup then Ryzen CPU's probably offer more.  But I'm more of plug-n-go type. Also this one came with a Fan which was good. This is a ""Turbo"" CPU as well which saves you electricity when you're just doing low priority tasks. Update: This CPU is still going strong. I paired it with a GTX 1650 Super Gaming X 4GB DDR6 graphics card.  It's doing very well considering the cost versus more expensive CPU's that are out there. I also of 16GB of RAM. In this arrangement I can easily run a basic Hadoop setup on a VirtualBox (From Hortonworks sandbox (CDP)). They need about 12GB of RAM at least and about 50GB + HardDrive space. But, this can push those newer games but will struggle a bit on the most demanding games. For those you'll need an I5 9th gen or greater for you super gamers out there.  But I'm an IT guy running Hadoop and Python and Machine Learning classes.  This is more than enough to do that.

Absolute bargain of a CPU
","

  If you want to build the absolute cheapest gaming PC with decent performance, look no other than this cpu.Sure it's only 4 cores and 4 threads, but for 1080p and 60 - 80 frames per second, it's more than capable.  This cpu gives you about 90% the performance of a 9900K for the price of 2 sticks of RAM.  CPU also runs really cool.  It sustains 4GHZ all the time and never once did it hit higher than 62C.The other option was a Ryzen AF which is 6 core 12 thread.  No doubt that the Ryzen would be a productivity monster, but in gaming performance it's still about the same, if not a tad slower than this Intel in a few titles.  I actually was considering buying the Ryzen AF but I couldn't find a decently priced AM4 motherboard.  I couldn't find anything less than $180.  For a budget build that's way too expensive.  I waited nearly a month to see if AM4 boards would be in stock, but no luck.  I was able to buy an LGA 1151 board for this cpu for only $60!  That's an absolute bargain.Currently I have this cpu paired with an old GTX 970.  It's still a great cpu but the vram limit hurts it's gaming performance from time to time.  A gpu with 6 - 8GB of vram would be best to pair with this.  A GTX 1660 ti or RX 5600XT would make an awesome pair.I played GTAV and BFV with this cpu and I get an average of 80 - 110 fps with a GTX 970.  It could only get better with a nicer gpu.

  The circuitry for graphics on Core processors is integrated on the CPU, not the motherboard.  If you are using an add-on graphics card,  this is a great value.

New i3 series has taken a turn for the absolute worst. DON'T BUY!
","

  There was a time when i3's were good, but I couldn't even play a game of CoD on the absolute lowest settings. I was using a 1660 Super (a $300 Graphics Card) so I know it wasn't the card. I was getting maybe 25 fps, and constant freezing. Totally unacceptable for any i series CPU. I'm very very unimpressed. In fact I'm appalled that this CPU hit 100% utilization so easily.For gaming, this CPU is completely non-functional for modern titles.As for general use? It does well, as long as you only plan on doing one task at a time.There is very little room for workload on this CPU. Even my programs were freezing when I had two or more open at a time.I know people test this CPU with solid states and lots of ram so it has no bottleneck, but that's not the price point of this CPU. Most will buy a HDD or an SSHD with 8gb of ram. And for that kind of build, this CPU is slow enough that it gets stuck any time it handles files off a disk drive.My hardware isn't bad either; I'm running a 2TB Firecuda with plenty of space left on it and good SATA cables.So I'm not sure what intel is doing with this CPU, but you'd clearly be better off spending 99 on a 1st or 2nd gen Ryzen 3. Terrible terrible CPU. I've seen Pentium Processors that perform better. Maybe even Celrons.

Fabulous and Fantastic Fortnite CPU!
","

  This processor is amazing.  I did a lot of research on my son's computer.  He is an avid Fortnite player, and likes, more like, loves performance!But, gee whiz, I can't afford to pop $1000 every time new games come out?  Well, the current gaming computer wasn't horrible, but it's been like 8 years since it was majorly upgraded, and it makes a whirlwind of a difference!He was only getting around 40-50 FPS(frames per second) on the old motherboard/CPU, and he was in real need of an upgrade.One thing that I forgot to mention is that a good video card is important too.  He has an AMD 480 in his, so for about $150-200, you'll need to invest in a decent video card.  Personally, I like the EVGA 1660, but the 1650 Super is a good one too for around $200 or less range.Through my research, I found out that not only does the i5-9400F do well, but this i3-9100F does an amazing job at gaming as well.So, for those who love Fortnite, you'll genuinely love this processor as well, and it's worth the upgrade.  Granted, most likely you'll have to get another motherboard, but I got one here as well, and it worked flawlessly!So, for about $75 or even less at times, you'll be astounded how well it performs.  I did a benchmark on the processor within my sons computer, and it almost performed my older i7-3770K!!!  Granted, that processor is about 10 years old now, and the i3 is only a few months old; Intel has done some major great jobs on their lower starting CPU'S!Great job, Intel!Our Build:i3-9100FMSI ProSeries H310 motherboardCorsair Vengence 8gb DDR4 Memory Stick-Just 1 stick 8gb.Antec Case750 Thermaltech PSUAMD RX 480 GPUAnd, we decided to get a new case to package it all together!Please make comments, what do you think?

At THE MOMENT you cannot make a Ryzen build that is cheaper than this for the same performance in games (July 16th 2020 when ordered) The 9100F is just so good for $71, if you NEED more cores (you dont yet for gaming) then please save yourself the headache and get a Ryzen build or a 10th gen board (for the future upgrade path) but if you just want to game at 1080p then this is great.I installed windows off of a USB drive with the ISO file you can get for free from the windows website. I had to make 0 tweaks from the bios in order to get windows to begin install. I would say from power on to booting into windows took between 7-10 minutes. In my room while browsing or watching youtube this computer barely has to use its fans. While playing warzone the Intel stock cooler gets loud HOWEVER the Zotac 1060 stays quiet and the case fan does too. For my first budget build I love this. I bench marked it against my friends 6th gen i5 6400T 1060 build and it matches and beats it in all of the games that we play. I would definitely recommend this build/motherboard to anyone would like to try a cheap reliable gaming PC build.

Amazing Bang-for-Your Buck CPU
","

  The i3-9100F CPU isn't the most powerful CPU. It's a 4 core / 4 thread chip clocked at 3.6ghz with a 4.2ghz boost (the 8100 it replaced was also a 3.6ghz chip, but with turbo settings disabled). Its RAM memory controller is also limited to 2400mhz, while other Intel 9000 series processors (i5 or better) can take up to 2666mhz without overclocking. Like other F-type CPUs but unlike the previous-gen 8100, the 9100F does not have integrated graphics, so a dedicated graphics solution is a must.All those caveats aside... the i3-9100F is a spectacular bargain that can do 95% of what its more expensive cousins do at half the price or less, for anything but an enthusiast workload. 4 threads is more than adequate for the typical user or gamer, as most typical applications and games are only lightly threaded. In both benchmarks and actual workloads, the 9100F performs nearly on-par with the i5-9400F, which is twice as expensive. The only real distinction between the chips in practice is that the 9400F is a 6 core processor; unless you routinely use heavily threaded applications, there's virtually no benefit to the i5 chips (until you reach the 9600KF, which is almost 3x the cost of the 9100F).Conversely, the new i3-10100 has been recently released on Intel's new LGA-1200 socket, and is a 4 core / 8 thread chip. However, as of now the LGA-1200 motherboards and 10000 series chips are more expensive than the 9000 series and outgoing LGA-1151 motherboards, and in lightly-threaded workloads the differences are very minor.Overall, the 9100F hits the sweet spot of price-performance for many users. Those who need more threads for enthusiast workloads should look at the new Comet Lake CPUs or the AMD Ryzen chips and those who need an onboard graphics solution should look elsewhere. But for regular users and budget-minded gamers, the 9100F is a lot of silicon power for not a lot of money.

Paired it with a GTX 1650, Wish is bought an i5

  I wanted to build a budget gaming machine so I paired this i3 with a GTX 1650. PC bottleneck calculator said these two should work just perfectly together. Well there are a lot of games out there that are  processor heavy, so even though the GPU could render the graphics with great detail, this processor wasn't strong enough to maintain 60fps on 1080 across the board. I feel like my graphics card has more to offer me then this processor can handle. Most games run great! It just struggles with the more demanding titles... They still run though. Some games don't run very great, but playable.

  I never had an issue with Intel....until now. I will start by saying that I bought the i3f. Since I already had a computer running the same exact processor and i was very happy with it. So for my gf computer i decided to switch her from AMD to Intel (since I always prefer them), when it came time for an upgrade. And the time came. The product arrived on time. No damage to package that I could tell of. Opened it up I noticed the fan wasnt spinning. I was lile ok that sucks since i wanted to use it but, since I had this same processor in my computer, and my computer is liquid cooled, I had an extra fan in working condition. So it was whatever. Plug it all in. Turn on comouter...nothing. No boot nothing. I was like....ok am I missing the cables?...no all cables were connected. I started thinking 'since fan was broken....man i hope processor isnt busted either'. So I plug this processor in my computer. This is where my nightmare begins. Since my comouter was using the same processor, I wanted to test it out 'is it really the processor before i return it's tyoe of thing. Take out my processor, plug in the new one. Same thing. Nothing. I was like ok its the processor. I got a bad processor so let me return it. I start putting my computer back together. Turn it on. Nothing. I was confused now....this was just working before I tested this new processor in it....it was just working i was just listening to music on it. Try again. Nothing. Im thinking about now 'please dont tell me this burned my mobo'. I take my comouter out to make sure I perfectly place that processor back in it place so it can just work....still nothing.So, now my mobo is fried. I can only assume my gf mobo is fried too now. I put my i3 into her mobo to see if somethig happens and again nothing. So now i am pretty sure I have 2 fried mobos and now I pray to got that the mono didnt fry my good processor in return when i turned my compuer back on.....smfh. Now I need to buy 2 processors and 2 mobos to have my computers back. Because i am not putting any of my parts now in mew parts because I'm probably just going to try the new parts too. And its not like I didnt know what i was doing I built all of my computers. All of this happening during stay indoors thing with COVID. What am i going to do now? Read 0_o kidding. Laughter is my only medicine now since I lost 2 computers in 1 night.I'm going to look for AMD mobo and CPU now. I have a really sour taste in my mouth for InTeL now. Pretty sure my experience is not the norm....but damn it sucks.

  If you think this cpu is for budget, think again. For such small price all task (including heavy) are performed just like an intel i5 or i7. The only constraint is as long as you do one thing at a time, not parallel many task at once.You are more than fine as long as you don't have special particular requirements like multithreading software related work or want to do two heavy tasks at same time.For such a small price, the performance is far above a budget cpu.Intel finally made a do it all desktop cpu with an affordable price.

  Pros: cheap, quiet, great VR and ultrawide desktop gaming performance, low power consumption, fastCons: not too great at multitaskingOverall, this is a wonderful CPU. I got it for a budget VR setup and I seriously couldn't be happier. I mean, where else are you going to find this price to performance ratio nowadays? VR games run perfectly. I run my system with a GTX 1080 and a Rift S and hold a constant 80 FPS in most games, even while streaming.The only thing you have to keep in mind multitasking - this CPU is just not very good at it. I experience slowdowns if I have too many program open at once. The single core performance is phenomenal, but it only has 4 cores and is not hyperthreaded, so multitasking is difficult for the little CPU that could. If you just make a habit of closing out of everything except your game and maybe discord and a web browser, you'll have no issues.I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a cheap PC build that can still run games and even stream VR.

  I used this in my daily driver gaming rig, and it is able to keep up with almost all modern games, and if you're not getting the performance you want from it, you can overclock it, when paired with an RX560 you can expect 60fps in most games.

  Good processor. It's able to run all my games. Playing Horizon Zero Dawn on my gtx1050. It's low. But still looks great because this game is a PC killer.

Solid CPU for light use when paired with a GTX 710.0
","

  Solid CPU for pfsense or HTPC as long as you have a GPU because this does not include an integrated one. I'd suggest pairing with a GTX 710 if you're just looking for connections.

Don't get fooled by the i3
","

  Don't think just because it's a i3 series, it won't be enough for gaming. It runs perfectly for games like Valorant, Fortnite (epic settings runs well, BUT you need a pretty good gpu to pair it with) , and Apex Legends. It is also capable to stream at 720p60 at all games that I've played so far. I recommend this to first-time builders.
