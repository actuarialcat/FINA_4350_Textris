Great CPU, Good Performance - Would Recommend for Anyone on a Budget
","

  This is a powerful little CPU that packs a lot of power and performance into a product that isn't very expensive. It's definitely a reasonable deal for its current price and it is worth every penny! I have been using this CPU in my personal desktop computer for six months, and it has been working great and stepping up to all the challenges that my not-too-overwhelming workload has been able to throw at it. I'd highly recommend it for anyone on a budget; there certainly are more powerful CPUs that can do a lot more, but at this price you can't beat this one! Thank you.

  During the mining craze, I also hoped on board. To get the job done, I purchased this CPU for my rig.

For basic computer use, this is an excellent CPU.
","

  If you're doing basic web surfing, word processing, emailing, and Turbo Taxing, this CPU is truly excellent. It's inexpensive, low power, low heat, and low fan noise. You would bump to the i5 or i7 if you are regularly doing tasks that benefit from more cores: compiling lots of computer program code, re-encoding [pirated] videos, etc. There are lots of special circumstances where an i5 or i7 is useful; if you're one of those special people you already know it.  If not, then this 3.9 GHz i3 is a great CPU.  (P.S.: at work I have a 12-core machine and compile a whole lot of computer code; at home, the i3 is my gem.)

Strong performer that has proven itself while powering highly-utilized virtual machinery.

  This Intel Core i3, 7th generation microprocessor, of the 7100 series is better than whatever was running my old, reliable Tandy 1000. It is now powering a ESXi server with a virtual machine Debian-based Network Attached Storage and a Server Core domain controller. On the NAS VM, I have multiple Docker containers and a ZFS pool. On the DC VM, I have DNS, DHCP, and AD DS (naturally). Anyways, it works very well and I consider it an excellent bang for the buck if you can forgo some of the niceties of Xenon, such as ECC support.

Great CPU for Your Budget Build
","

  Built my first comp a few weeks ago on a budget, was a little skeptical on getting an i3 over i5 (i7 was definitely not in the budget). But i was impressed by it's out of the box specs and has good reviews so i saved the $100 and put it towards better graphics card and more RAM. I am impressed so far, does everything i've asked out of it just fine. Only complaint is it will get a little bogged down (and i do mean only a little) when you have a ton of screens open and doing a lot of stuff at the same time (Steam, LoL, CSGO, RL, Google, Settings), but that was only after i first turned it on and was trying to update/dl everything and play games all at the same time. But its only a dual core and i knew that going in, and its not typical that i run a ton of stuff at the same time. If you can afford the i5-7600k i would tell you to go for it, but if you are on a budget this is a great CPU.

Watching a YouTube video while keeping a streaming tab off to the side pretty much maxed out the CPU resulting in stuttering.

According to benchmarks on UserBenchmark this processor performs nearly exactly the same as my laptop processor. My laptop processor is a quad core i7-6700hq. This dual core processor performs just as well as my laptop quad core. I put in a GTX 1050 TI graphics card which also near exactly matches the performance of my laptop's GTX 970m. With this processor I build a desktop that can do everything my laptop can do, but for a third of the cost. Pretty awesome low end processor!One thing I forgot to mention is that it comes with its own stock fan/heatsink. Had I known this I wouldn't have bought the $40 noctua low profile fan. Since you can't overclock this processor you really don't need a better cooler than the stock one. I bought an i7-6700K last year and that didn't come with a fan or heatsink, so I didn't think this one would. If you have an i5 or i7 processor I'd buy an aftermarket cooler. For an i3 like this one just use the stock. You really aren't going to see any performance benefits.

Wonderful for the average computer
","

  For the price this is great, powers my 4k monitor for videos fine and runs the basics smoothly. I had a 7700k but decided to wait for the next generation and hope that it uses the same socket. For everyday tasks, web browsing, office, music, videos it runs smoothly and efficiently. For those tasks I could not see a difference at all between the two. I have not attempted any games with this and I use a different computer for video and photo editing so I cannot comment on that. If you are an average computer user and want to be using the latest generation of Intel products the I3-7100 will certainly do the job at a very low price.

Great CPU for gaming, general use, or even a small home server like I am doing.
","

  2 cores, 4 threads, very powerful with minimal power use and heat production.  Using this for my home server running plex, recording security cam footage, etc.  On 24/7 and barely breaks a sweat.  Working out perfect as it uses about 8watts most of the time for the CPU, just my hard drives that are soaking up all the power.

exceeded expectations, but hits right on the mark.
","

  Okay, so I chose this as a budget option to see if the difference between similarly priced amd cores was noticeable. it is. i would definitely choose the 7350k for long term options, and at that rate choose an i5. just let me say though, that paired with a 3 g 1060 i was playing BF1 maxed out @ 1080p. but the small amount of cache becomes apparent in cpu intense games like company of heroes, or total war. paired up with a 1050 i think this this would be perfect. so i give it good reviews, out of sheer price/performance. the hyperthreading takes some weight off of your shoulders, and intel deserves a thank you for allowing this chip to utilize it.

best choice for budget
","

  bought an i3-7100 because i felt my fx 6300 wasn't stable for my gaming needs. I paired this with my gtx 1060 6gb and i was surprised how its able to keep over 60 fps unlike my fx the frames were everywhere. not the best cpu that will take advantage for the 1060 but i was just looking for something in budget to keep me steady over 60 fps while i save for a top cpu. I was never an Intel fan nor AMD fan but switching to intel was the best move i have done.this is something i want to mention if anyone is debating over intel or ryzen. a big reason i moved over to intel was because they haven't stop taking out processors and i have a good path of upgrading unlike amd with socket am3. now with ryzen out who know if that just for a while and then boom AMD leaves again for some years.

One of the best CPUs made if you need single core performance and want a low wattage CPU
","

  I wanted a low wattage CPU that would work well for gaming. For those that don't know many games even today really only use 1 core at a time. This puppy is extremely low wattage to begin with (lower wattage= less heat generated) and hopefully longer system life. This i3's single core performance is up there with $350+ xeons and i7's. So for the price it's very impressive as long as your games can only use 1 or 2 cores at a time. For a bit of education if you do ctrl+alt+delete and it looks like a game or process is using all cores equally it is usually a lie. It is in reality one core getting hammered at 100% then jumping to the next one in the series. You have to actually research to figure out how many cores your game actually uses at one time. If you aren't a gamer and for some reason are building a desktop for casual internet use like watching youtube videos and browsing the internet an i3 like this is probably the best thing for you to buy. Especially since it will actually save you money over a beefier processor that you will never actually fully utilize anyway.

Careful if you want this for gaming!

  i used this processor in a budget under $700 build with a 1060 3GB card. Well it works for sure and I saw 60 frames in dark souls 3 across the board no issues on high settings. However, the amount of stuttering is horrendous! Dark souls 3 isn't CPU intensive and I even turned settings down to help it but saw no improvement. I highly recommend going for nothing less than an i5.. which I'm now purchasing an i5-7500 to suit my needs. Honestly I would only buy this for ""LIGHT"" gaming only. Otherwise good luck with stutters and getting frustrated.

Great gaming CPU
","

  Great processor for gaming, however it is only about 10-15% faster that a pentium g4560 for twice the price. Hower this cpu is best if you want a well rounded pc using about 8gb of ddr4 and a rx480 or gtx1060 with no bottlenecking. The pentium is a great cpu but may have a slight bottleneck on the cards listed above. So if the 60$ is not a big deal to you this cpu will give you a peace of mind of a well rounded budget machine. Also worth noting a benefit of kaby lake is its required for 4k streaming netflix on pc's so this is a good feature.

This CPU does not work with Windows 7, because of a marketing/sales decision by Microsoft.

  If you have an entry level 2 or 1 series chipset mainboard than this is the most convenient chip you can buy. Pentium g4560 and g4600 is much better prices but they are lacking some instructions. If you find a tray version cheaper i3-7100, buy it. Compared to i3-8100, it is only 10% slower at most.

  PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MOTHERBOARD BEFORE THIS. Make sure your motherboard has the latest update when get the intel kaby lake. I was dumb because I purchased the Gigabyte H110-A and the computer wouldn't work for some reason. I was sure it was the same socket LGA 1151 but for some reason the computer kept turning on and off.  After accepting defeat I took it to a computer shop (yes i know what an amateur). They realized that it wasnt working because the motherboard wasn't updated to intel kaby lake. So in conclusion, MAKE SURE YOUR MOTHERBOARD IS UPDATED BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
