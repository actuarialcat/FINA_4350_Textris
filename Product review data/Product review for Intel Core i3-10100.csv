Excellent processor for the money
","

  I bought this to go into a desktop as a gift to my parents. The processor has 4 cores and 8 threads, and is very fast. It should be enough processor for them for many years.The main reasons I decided to buy this over an AMD processor:* This processor comes with an iGPU and since it won't be used for gaming it is cheaper than a comparable 3300x + GPU combo.* I wanted to port their existing hard disk over to the new machine, and using this processor allowed me to buy a 16GB intel optane chip for $20. The intel optane chip was excellent for their needs. AMD's current caching product that does something similar is less user friendly. I'm glad I went with intel on this one.* I was able to buy this for $122 which is the MSRP, while I wasn't able to find any Ryzen 3100 or 3300x anywhere near their MSRPs as the supply has been low for quite some time.

At least it's available right now....
","

  Purchased the least expensive Core i3 CPU just to get my Z490 build up-and-running.  I'm waiting until Intel manufactures enough Core i7 and i9 CPUs that the D-Bag scalpers no longer find hoarding them profitable.  Once that happens, I'll upgrade.  All this nonsense has me thinking that I should have gone with an X570 board and an AMD Ryzen processor.  THOSE are available at retail price.

What a sleeper of a CPU !
","

  Believe it or not this entry level 10100 is only 13% off from their flagship CPU the 10:900. For just over $120 this thing is absolutely a screamer. Hyper threading in this series has made a huge difference in my opinion. This thing seems to be holding performance with my 9600k, at least till I overclock it. I bought it for now since the other new intel's were to expensive or not available now. I use it with the new MSFS 2020 & am getting good FPS with 4K at High settings, amazing & with a GTX 1070 ! Idles at 28 degrees c and never goes above 40 degrees c under load with a 240mm AIO. Definitely the best deal in the lineup !

Great for a fast and quiet PC
","

  I built a SFF PC, and I wanted something low power (quiet) that could drive qty 3, 4k monitors.  This CPU worked great combined with the ASRock Z490 itx/tb3 motherboard.It has no problem handling all my desktop apps, it's very responsive.  PC power consumption at the plug is around 24W idle with screens on and 10Gb Ethernet card, and the fans are whisper quiet.My previous SFF PC had a X470 and Ryzen CPU.  I had tons of problems with USB compatibility and the power consumption was higher.  I still have a Ryzen in my homelab server, and for that it's great, but I think Intel still hold the lead for low power and compatibility.

The new 7700K
","

  for a budget CPU this screams , on par with a old 7700K ( google it ! ) 4 cores and 8 threads make a great budget gaming CPU, pair it up with some DDR 2666 and a nice  1660 super and it is quite capable of 90 FPS in shadow of the tomb raider .Runs cool and quiet while sipping power , sure the 3300x beats it , asuming you can even buy one but Intel has one Huge advantage over AMD , Stability , what good is spped if Your system has errors , usb issues , memory issues , no Intel is the king of stability !

is fast
","

  For a little over a hundred bucks this thing does a good job. I was working with an amd fx 6300 for many years. Here are my numbers on three very different games at 1080p using an AMD rx 570 as the gpu (my frames are locked at 60 in most cases)Monster Hunter World (High settings)Before: 30-45After: constant 60 with no dropsAshes of the singularity (benchmark)Before: low stress 55-60, medium stress 30, high stress 20After: low stress 60+, medium 50, high stress 40Minecraft (fast+optifine 12 render)Before: 60, but with annoying stuttering on loading chunksAfter: 60, with virtually no noticeable drops while loading. Render can be set much higher now as well.All in all, this thing does a great job for your average adventure/shooter but for rts gameplay you may want to consider a stronger unit.

Amazing Price Performance! Smart Money Buy!
","

  One fast CPU for the price at $119.99 .... great price performance ......  remember  technology ..... depreciates super fast ...... just blink and it’s worthless ...... just look at all the other high end Core i7 CPUs you bought in the past at twice or three times the price of the this new 10th gen CPU ..... this entry level CPU now out performs all of them ...... this is rude awakening ..... Used CPU seller still asking prices that are more than this new CPU .... no brainer purchase ..... depreciate it in 3 to 4 years .... tech moves onUPDATE:  After buying this CPU it drop 10% within the fist week, luckily Amazon flexibility allow me to get back the 10% ...... only shows how aggressive tech depreciates ......

Best budget intel CPU in a long time!
","

  Absolutely fantastic value for money, great for gaming and video editing!4 cores and 8 threads for less than $130 is insane, pair this with a B460 motherboard, 16gb Ram, and a GTX 1650 or 1660 Super and it makes for a really good budget build!Definitely recommend!

Solid Gaming CPU
","

  This is the best performing CPU I've had in this price range. If your looking for a cheap CPU to put with a GTX 1650, look no more. This CPU crushes Ryzen 3 3200G and Ryzen 3 3100 and comes mighty close, in gaming to the Ryzen 3 3300X. The CPU runs cool. It's 3.6 Ghz base speed makes this chip super snappy gaming and general use. A+ rating all the way !!!

Works great and performs amazingly.
","

  Great value for the $100 I paid. Barely produces any heat while undervolted and underclocked 5%. The intel stock cooler is more than enough for this processor under those conditions if you can believe it.

i3 10100 10th Gen Meh
","

  Great processor for basic tasks just don't push it too hard. Adding Hyper threading was a good move on Intel's part however it was not enough to make it a compelling buy.

Bought it on sale! I liked it!
","

  Powerful little processor for the amount of money I spent on it. Replaced my i3-6100 with this. Using it right now to type this review. Plays most of my current lineup of games, although in full disclosure I haven't tested it out on the most recent batch (watch_dogs legion, or any other recent AAA). Plays Assassin's creed Syndicate OK and that game's a hot mess.

Don't buy delicate PC parts from Amazon.
","

  Processor itself might be fine, just don't order it from Amazon.  DOA Cpu.  Box was tampered with, CPU was incorrectly handled with a visible fingerprint from thermal paste on the delicate underside of said CPU.Really? Lol! shame on me though it is amazon after all.  Ill stick to newegg.
