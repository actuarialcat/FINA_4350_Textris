","

  PROS:- A 4 core, 4 thread for ~ $100- Excellent bundled heatsink-fan- Unlocked processor with great chances in the ""silicon lottery""; *everyone* should easily reach 3.7 or 3.8 ghz on the bundled cooler, & some will pull off 3.9 - 4.1 ghz through a combo of luck/fine tuning/aftermarket cooling- For the price conscious, excellent upgrade path with AM4 chipset and the B350 boardsCONS:- IPC performance is edged out by similar Intel offeringsCONCLUSION: From a price-to-performance perspective, these procs are unassailable, especially when Amazon and others have recently marked as low as $99. With Zen+/Zen2 around the corner, expect prices on these Summit Ridge procs to come down even further in 2018. We now have 4C/4T truly at entry level!DETAILS: The packaging is typical for what you'd expect. Install instruction manual is spartan, but sufficient. Thermal paste comes pre-applied. You need to be careful about removing the plastic mould case for the heatsink-fan from the box, as small particles of cardboard from the box may end up in the thermal paste. If this happens, a fine point tweezer will suffice to remove such particles.Others recommend to remove the pre-applied paste and apply your own, but I think this is unnecessary. I have been using the proc with the pre-applied paste for just under a month, and thermals are excellent: 26-28 at complete idle; 30-32 when at desktop doing minor tasks or in a warm room; 45-47 during sustained gaming; never went beyond ~ 60 during 45 min. CPU stress testing; conductivity is excellent as temps return from max back to idle levels after only a couple minutes from ceasing such applications. Be aware, if you are building a system for the first time, that there is a ""burn in"" period after first installing a cpu: initially, when you first run your machine, idle temps will look quite high, like in the 40s, but that is simply because the paste is ""setting in."" After a couple of hours and running some apps, idle temps will stabilize to normal levels of high 20s or 30, and it will idle at those temps from then on.The bundled heatsink-fan, Wraith Stealth, is excellent for a stock part, and will definitely allow overclocking. I have been running at 1.3 volts and 3.80 clockspeed for just under a month with the aforesaid temps. The Wraith Stealth keeps the Ryzen3 cool enough to allow additional ""boost"" clockspeed as temps permit: during heavy gaming, my Ryzen 3 automatically overclocked itself further from 3799 to 3834, as recorded by CPUID's ""Hardware Monitor"" app.All Ryzen procs are unlocked, so overclocking is easily done via the BIOS by simply typing in a new multiplier, for example, typing in ""38"" will yield 3800 mhz. Voltage can be easily adjusted as well. Be aware that you will need the B350 or higher range of motherboards to overclock.There really is no need for anyone to purchase a Ryzen 3 1300X when the Ryzen 3 1200 overclocks so well. Currently, all of the Ryzen procs tend to top out at around 4.0 ghz, so spending an extra $20 on the 1300x in the hopes of getting ""better bin"" is just not the case. The bottom line, is that both the 1200 and 1300X will top out at ~ 3.9 - 4.0 on the Wraith Stealth, so you can save yourself $20 and get the 1200, and put the savings towards an aftermarket heatsink-fan, if you are so inclined. Or, just keep the stock Wraith Stealth and set the proc to 3.8 with no fuss whatsoever and be on your way ;)A note about chipsets: earlier in 2017, there was a lot of gnashing of teeth because Ryzen was not playing nice with certain RAM, not working with Windows 7, not properly addressing its cores in various apps, not accurately reporting temps, etc. These issues have been resolved as far as my testing has seen. I have had zero problems running the latest BIOS/chipset from MSI (September 20 ver.) on a B350 PC Mate in Win 7 64 bit. So the take home for newbie system builders: please, make sure your chipset drivers are properly updated! The mainstay motherboard makes, MSI, Gigabyte, Asus, etc., all have Win 7 hotfixes, USB drivers, etc. to get your Ryzen board running properly with Win 7, if this is something you have been concerned about.Numerous, trusted benchmarkers on YouTube and such will show that IPC performance is generally inferior to Intel offerings. However, you don't buy these types of procs to have ""bleeding edge"" performance with something like a 1080 Ti. Performance testing across the enthusiast space has shown conclusively that the Ryzen 3 will handle up to and including a GTX 1060 6 gig without bottlenecking the card: that is absolutely great news for budget builders. If you are planning on using a higher vid card than that tier, then yes, you will be better served by an i7 or something.But if you are planning on running games at 1080p resolution, at typical refresh rates, you are probably going to be utilizing a vid card in the GTX 1060 range or below, and for that, these Ryzen 3 procs are an excellent option if price-to-performance is highly important to you. In real-world benches, an overclocked Ryzen 3 1200 at 3.9 is only a few percentage points behind an earlier gen i5, such as an i5 2500K, so that must be taken into account.Do not, in other words, get stuck on the idea that these Ryzen 3 are simply an ""i3"" equivalent: no, really what you are getting is a competitive, pre-CoffeeLake i5 equivalent for about $100 price point. That is just awesome, anyway you choose to slice it.This brings us to another point: upgrade path. The Pentium G4560-4620 are still touted as the ""budget kings,"" for $80-$97, but while those Kaby Lake Pentiums are indeed excellent performers (especially as IPC is concerned), they are, in the end, dual-core chips with SMT. The Ryzen 3 is a true 4 core, 4 thread. Further, the Kaby Lake chipsets are a dead end, in terms of upgrade path. Sure, you might be able to swap in an older Kaby Lake i5 or i7 down the road in 2018 to replace your Pentium...but those procs will also be more rare at that point, and competition to get them on places such as eBay will drive prices up to the diminishing-returns-territory.Moving towards 2020, games are going to be going multi threaded and multi core. In past years, single threaded and IPC remained dominant largely because if the Intel i5. But now, with Intel going 4 core on their i3 lineup, not to mention DX12, the market will truly bear multi core and multi thread design for games and apps. This is a very big reason to not saddle yourself with Sky Lake or Kaby Lake at this point.By contrast, AMD's AM4 platform is slated to be supported through 2020, and we have confirmation now that Zen+/Zen 2 will indeed utilize this platform, requiring only a simple BIOS flash. What this means, is that in 2018 or 2019, you will easily be able to swap out your Ryzen 3 with AMD's latest offering, on your existing motherboard/rig, if you find you beed more cores and/or threads for future titles and apps.What this also means, is you can easily go with future, retail, in-the-box parts versus having to do the eBay or Amazaon Marketplace hunt for pre-used parts from say the Kaby Lake lineup.Perhaps most exciting, the market competition will see some great choices for 2018-2020. As Zen+/Zen2 procs start appearing, the original Summit Ridge AMD parts will drop in price. Ryzen 5 1600 can, at the time of writing, already be had for about $190; in 2018, expect prices to drop further as Zen+/Zen2 make their appearance. This is excellent for the budget conscious. You can build a Ryzen 3 rig now, and then down the road swap in something like an R5 1600, new in the box, probably for as little as $130, on the same motherboard.To sum up: if you are looking at Ryzen 3 as a potential choice, it is most likely because you are on a strict budget, or are very budget conscious and like to get the best return for your dollar in price-to-performance. In those cases, the Ryzen 3, and the AM4 platform more generally, are excellent, especially if you take the modicum of effort to overclock your Ryzen 3.The large, established review sites (ex: Tom's Hardware) are, at the time of writing, recommending the lower tier Coffee Lake parts for budget or mid range builds, and this, in my opinion, is just simply ludicrous, if for no other reason than you simply can't even find Coffee Lake procs for purchase. This is to say nothing of the very inane way Intel chose to go with its motherboard lineup.What's more, sites such as Tom's continue to advocate for the Kaby Lake Pentiums as the preferred budget rig: again, this seems completely ludicrous to me. Why someone would decide to go with a dual core and a totally dead motherboard/chipset line, when they could go with a new chipset line set to last through 2020 with a baseline proc that is a true 4C/4T, just for the sake of saving (maybe) about $15 and getting 5-10% higher frames in older, single-threaded games from 2014-2016, is completely beyond me.As one of the absolute best, budget centered options we have seen in a decade, a good B350 board and a Ryzen 3 1200 are very, very hard to beat, especially in light of Coffe Lake's scarcity issues.If you are in the market for a budget rig, and are on the fence between going with budget Kaby or Sky Lake parts versus Ryzen, Ryzen is simply the more efficient and future proof choice.With that said, if you are then on another fence as to if you should go Ryzen 3 1200, 1300X or 1400, the 1200 is the clear winner for price-to-performance, especially if you take a few minutes to go into BIOS and overclock.If you are willing to spend more money for a 1400, you'd be better served going all the way and spending the extra for a 1500X or better yet, a Ryzen 5 1600.For around the $100 - $140 price point, however, you will want to go with the Ryzen 3 1200.

  This is all you need and it it 3 years old tech!!  It is 2020 BABY! Picked up this for $62 because it is all you need to play any game. as long as you are sporting a good GPU. PSU, and at least 8 gigs of RAM.  All of which will cost more than the CPU, including a MB.It says“3.4 GHz Precision Boost (up to 3.45 GHz with XFR)True quad core, unlocked CPU architectureA future proof, VR Ready platform; Includes AMD Wraith Stealth coolerSupported technologies are zen core architecture, amd sensemi technology, avx2, fma3Maximum system memory speed”Out of the box the CPU is 3.1 gig.  I have a decent MB, an B450 Gaming Plus Max which has plenty of tweaks and setting.  Its at 3.3 in gaming mode, and the RAM cannot be fully utilized because the CPU is a 1st gen.  When the 8 cores and 16 threads are $60 in a couple years, I can use everything without any OS installs, file transfers, or back ups.Thanks AM4 CPU Socket!This CPU will handle it all. Be happy they are making $300 and $900 CPUs!**26 July B O R E D!!  This stupid pandemic!  So as you can see i OC'ed the 3.1 to 4.1 and the temps and stress are flawless.  I was playing the division last night, waiting for it to load on my 8 year old flat screen TV, and let me tell you, the ""watch"" image thats there while loading LOOKED LIKE IT WAS coming out of the TV!!  I asked my wife. ""Is it me or is that scary sharp"", and she was like WOW!An 8 GIG MSI GPU doesn't hurt.16AUG20  DO NOT BUY THIS CPU at this price!! NOT a BUY even a little.

Dont buy unless you want to run a separately graphics card!!!

  Building a budget PC for my father (absolutely not a gamer). First off let me say I am a intel guy (first time ryzen / AMD product buyer here). So I am used to intel HD integrated graphics in everything, and being able to do basic web browsing, watching youtube/ netflix without needing a graphics card(GPU).Anyway found the best deal on a ryzen 3 1200. I bought one NOT realizing that this CPU REQUIRES a separate GPU. So since a ryzen 3 1200 wont even show bios without a GPU installed. I either have to go spend $50+ on a crusty old ebay graphics card. While simultaneously upgrading the brand new 450 watt power supply I just bought to support an old power hungry GPU. Or return the 1200 for a 2200G for a difference of $21. I will be returning this POS 1200 tomorrow. I highly recommend you buy the ryzen 3 2200G unless you plan on running a separate GPU. To be honest I really dont get the point of the ryzen 3 1200's existence. If you want to game and have or plan to buy a nice GPU, your going to want something better then this budget processor. And anybody looking to build a budget PC like me is going to buy the 2200G instead of buying the ryzen 3 1200 and a GPU.

  Solid CPU for those on a budget.I''m running mine over-clocked to 3.6 and have it paired with a GTX 1060 6GB it can pretty much max out games at 1080p  However the CPU DOES hit 100% utilization with a game like Witcher 3 or GTA5 maxed out.

  I set my expectations to high.  And thats not the products fault.  Its not meant for any AAA games. Not even on all low video settings.  But it does perform fine for most esports.  It lost a star because of how it came.  I did buy 3rd party, but that doesnt excuse the fact that the title clearly says that the item comes with a wraith cooler.  It came with a cheap aftermarket cpu cooler.  I will be keeping this cpu, but just for trouble shooting and flash bios if i have to.  All in all, $80 aint bad for what you get.

  Literally the most pointless processor you can buy. No onboard graphics at all, so being a budget office CPU is out of the question because you have to buy a dedicated GPU too.

A game changer

  This is a fantastic deal for the money.  A modern, fast, (relative to old CPU), low energy, cool running chip at 100$ or less is a real breakthrough for AMD among many others lately.  Perfect for standard users, but it does the job on most games pretty well too, casual gamers rejoice!  You won't find a better value out there, I promise.  Go ahead and get the 2200g now that it's out, it has graphics on the chip itself.  But if you do any sort of gaming besides minesweeper, keep your dedicated video card.  I'm excited about what the future holds for APU's though.  The 2400g can actually play some games on lower settings.Even the 2nd gen still has the single downside to Intel of slightly lower single core performance making Intel a marginally better gaming choice (worse for other things) vs 2000 series, but in time AMD will pass them in that too.  I have a 2600x now and it's just amazing.  This isn't the AMD of a few years ago, they have their act together and Intel is panicked.

Great CPU for the price.
","

  It was around double the current price it is right now when it released and now that a few years later it has gone down in price made this the perfect CPU for my build. I recommend this for budget builders who look forward to using a Rx 580/gtx 1060 . This is a true 4 core/4 thread CPU for $50 and it comes with the wraith stealth cooler with satisfied me very nicely. This is great for first time builders like me to want to get into gaming on a budget, although this doesn't have integrated graphics so look for a different CPU if you are looking to build that kind of PC. In my current build I paired this with a Rx 580 and I can get it to run games like R6 on the Ultra preset and get smooth frame rates. As great of a CPU as this is you'll probably only want to use the gtx 1060 and the Rx 580 as going any higher could cause some bottle-necking. I would look into the future to upgrade to a Ryzen 5 CPU for more core and threads if you are looking for content creation, but for gaming purposes this CPU fits just fine for first time gamers who are on a budget.

Great CPU in general.

  Honestly, this CPU is just great. For people on a budget, for gaming (even tho CS:GO is fickle with it because it values Intel over AMD) and is just a good launching point if you plan to upgrade (like me)Thanks to it's PGA socket, you can't really mess up when installing it. It obviously follows the same rules as other CPUs (Golden Triangle lines up with Golden Triangle) and the stock cooler is great for basic stock performance. The cooler is easy to install, just remember to keep even pressure on the heatsink when screwing it in. Go corner to corner and keep the amount of turns the same until install. Not doing so can result in an uneven spread of thermal paste or even a cracked IHS or CPU die.Honestly, get this if you're on a budget, and already have a graphics card at least. If you don't, or can't afford for for a decent amount of time. Get the one with the integrated graphics. Otherwise, this one.

  Absolute best once it's over clocked, on stock cooler I'm pulling 3.9ghz at 1.3v stable, games well, and temps stay pretty low, average about 29-34c. I didn't realise there were so many reviewers that can't read, the stars off for not having an APU architecture is the reviewers fault for not doing the're homework, this processor is amazing and currently 70$, can't beat the price.

The perfect beginner CPU
","

  Installation is very simple and the included cooler allows for a great overclock.  The vast majority of these chips will get to 3800 mHz no sweat, so go get a B350 motherboard or another that supports overclocking!  The bang for your buck is outstanding with these AMD chips.Highly recommended to 1st time builders, value hunters, and AMD enthusiasts!My 1st build -CPU - Ryzen 3 1200 @ 3800 mHzGraphics - GTX 1060 3GBMemory - Patriot Viper Elite 8GB DDR4 (2x4) @ 2666 mHzMotherboard - Gigabyte GA-AB350M-DS3H

Only concern I had was stability wise to get a kit of memory to work nice at CPU speed
","

  Well for an entry level desktop CPU, I was fairly impressed.I matched it with a 1050, 1060 6GB, then a 1070 and the CPU wasn't bottlenecking as much as I thought it would.Plus well, AMD is back now!! Only concern I had was stability wise to get a kit of memory to work nice at CPU speed, but I don't think that's typically the CPU but more the motherboard or, most likely, the ram itself.

  So far so good, no problems that I'm aware of yet. I built a rig using this for my brother and so far he's not had any issues. Nothing technical that required me to troubleshoot any sort of error logging. So it looks to me like this thing is in great shape and no dead cores or anything. I'm happy with the results and it works really well. I always did like AMD products and this only improved upon my loyalty to their products.

It does VR

  It can run VR. Watch a tutorial on YouTube if you do not know how to install. You need to screw the screws diagonally and not next to each other first. Get them screwed in a little and then tighten them up once they are all connected to the motherboard. Make sure the AMD logo is parallel to the I/O before you set it down.

Absolute bargain, can't complain at all!

  All I can say is, it's a truly remarkable CPU for the price.I'm running my R3 on a Corsair H60 because I was going for silent in my rig but it's really not needed if you're not concerned about noise.  The stock cooler is very quiet considering its performance, but it's not totally silent, and because my PC is about 2 feet away from me on my desk, I wanted something totally silent (the H60 with aftermarket fans gives me this).  That said it can handle a 3.7GHz overclock without issues.Mine is clocked at 3.95GHz @ 1.275V on a ASRock X370 Killer SLI/ac. Cinebench score is 605-610 multi test, which is higher than the Core i5 7500 in my other machine scores.  Pretty impressive, this CPU costs half as much and comes with a MASSIVELY better cooler.It handles 1080p gaming with no issues (Just Cause 3, GTA V, Doom, etc).  I will be testing 1440p at Christmas and will edit and report back.EDIT: 1440p time.  Yes, it can handle it.  Mine's paired with a GTX 970.  The CPU does hit 100% CPU usage often in GTA V, but it never stutters or drops frames - not even a little.  Usually sits around 90%.  I get a solid 60fps with the GTX 970 (also overclocked).  In PUBG at 1440p it sits around 50-80% (wildly varying).  Battlefield 1 it's under 50% most of the time.  It's definitely at its limit at 1440p, but it works.  It's a fantastic cheap CPU, plenty for 1080p gaming and generally enough for 1440p.  It could probably handle a GTX 1070 without issues, considering that in more GPU-dependent titles, the CPU is never maxed out.

I have been running it overclocked from the factory 3.1MHz to 3.5MHz, which is the clock speed of the next in line Ryzen 1300X, since about a week after I got it.  I ran it stock for the first week just to make sure everything was smooth - and it was!  The included Wraith cooler does the job & I have never had any heat issues whatsoever.  It is paired with the ASRock AB350M0HDV motherboard.  I have had ZERO issues, crashes, nothing but 'set it & forget it' performance.  It just WORKS.

  Coming from a locked third gen i3 the difference was huge. It has 4 cores, is unlocked, and has plenty of cache, it's like a 7th Gen i5 but better! Plus the included cooler pretty good too.Shoutout to r/ayymd

  What's not to love? That new ""Wraith"" cooler is way better than any stock fan I've encountered in 25 years of building computers, and this thing clocked up with the click of a button and has offered ZERO issues in multiple builds I've used this CPU with.I ran a K6-2 in my first LANbox, then later a dual Athlon MP, an Athlon X2, and most recently an A8 in my laptop and an FX8350 in my desktop. They've all had their pros and cons, but this new Ryzen series is FANTASTIC! Way to knock it out of the park, AMD!

  Holy sh*t. This. Little. Beast. This CPU is asking, screaming, to be overclocked to the top of your board and cooler's capacity. I managed to overclock it up to 3.9 GHz on STOCK cooler with very decent thermals. THIS IS AMAZING. With the OC this CPU reached Cinebench scores similar to those of an i5 6600K on a database for less than half the price. I paired it with a GTX 1060 and have no problem playing games at 1440p high settings, reaching anywhere between steady 70 and 120 fps on Battlefield 1. AMD is back in the game.

Doesn't include GPU, so plan accordingly

  It's a decent processor, but there are 2 things I strongly dislike about this chip.  1> It doesn't include any video capabilities that less expensive processors have and 2> The AM4 socket still has pins instead of a more durable surface-mount like Intel.  My CPU arrived with pins bent and I had to take a razor blade and magnifying glass to bend them back.  Getting tired of AMD's processors arriving with bent pins, and my 50+ year old eyes struggle to see them clearly.

  Not much to say other than it works and does its job great. The only problem I have is with the included cooler. I noticed a ticking noise in my computer and believe it is being caused by it. There are no cables touching any of the fan blades and the noise comes and goes. I believe it's the cooler because it is the only smart fan that is in my computer and would explain why the noise isn't constant because it would only happen when the fan is spinning fast. This is fine though because I plan to get a new cooler down the line.

  I made this review to counter the clown who wrote ""I get it, this is budget friendly, but the ryzen 5 1400 is only $50 more and you get way better performance. I've tested all of the ryzens out and I must say that the ryzen 5 1400 gives you the most bang for your low buck. Don't get this, get the ryzen 5 1400, ryzen 3 should not exist.""Obviously the Ryzen 5s are more expensive and the Ryzen 3s are here to complete against the Intel i3 processors.  A ridiculous review as the one mentioned above was written by a complete clown, is a waste of everyone's time and prevents real customers from purchasing products they normally otherwise would.

The 1200 is a decent performer.
","

  I decided to upgrade my FX 6300 since it was showing it's age, especially in Destiny 2. Since there's a refresh coming to the Ryzen line next year I went with the mid-range Asus ROG Strix B350 motherboard, a higher-end G.Skill XFlare 16GB DDR4 3200 kit, and a budget CPU to hold me over. That's where the Ryzen 3 1200 comes into the picture. I'm still using my Asus Strix R9 390 for a GPU, as it's a fairly solid performer. A Vega 56 is in my future, though.I decided to do some overclocking with the chip and pushed it to 3.8GHz. I hit a voltage wall after 3.8 and didn't manage to push it any further under the safe maximum of 1.4v, as per AMD's recommendation. Still, 700MHz over stock on a budget chip isn't bad, especially using the stock cooler.The 1200 is a decent performer. In the EDZ, a part of Destiny 2 with areas that have really poor optimization, the 6300 was choking and dropping my framerate as low as the mid-20s. That's even on low settings. It was only in certain spots, but it still made the game feel like a slide show in those areas. The lowest dips I see now in those same areas are the mid-40s with medium settings. It's still not ideal, but it's a hell of a lot better than it was. It's important to note that my framerate is now 90+ everywhere else in the game, including Crucible and Strikes. This is just a couple areas where I notice some serious bottlenecking at the CPU. It's interesting to note that in those same areas my GPU usage drops very low, so it's just the CPU at fault for the slowdown.I did try a few other games with it, but they mostly didn't show significant improvement since they were older titles and I cap my framerate at 142 through the driver. Doom with Vulkan floored me, though. It's gorgeous, and I can run it at max settings with a framerate over 100fps. That's pretty impressive from a budget CPU.I'd strongly recommend that anyone looking at a Ryzen chip for gaming go with at least the 1600, especially if you're interested in playing Destiny 2, or other newer titles. Benchmarks indicate that the 1600X posts around 20fps higher than the 1200 in D2 on the bottom end, and even more on average.  If you're mostly interested in older titles, or if you're just building a budget PC, this chip is a great choice. I'm happy with what I got for the time being, but I'm looking forward to the next generation of Ryzen to go with a higher core-count CPU.EDIT: I've done some experimenting with several older titles and noticed improved performance over the 6300. However, other newer titles also choke this CPU. I picked up Space Hulk: Deathwing, and I have the same issue with it that I have with Destiny 2: sporadic framerate dips with 0 GPU usage because the CPU just can't draw a frame fast enough. If you're building a Ryzen system and you're looking to game, spend the extra $100-200 and get either the 1600X or 1700. It's a lot more future proof.

Best Performance for the Price

  This little processor is definitely a bang for for your buckI see this CPU as the starter to go to, if not go for the Ryzen 3 1300x as you’d get a bit more power for just 20 dollars more, and trust me this processor could use a bit more power so you wouldn’t be missing out if you went ahead with the 1300xBut what you’re getting with the 1200 is not only the power needed to play some great games, but you’re also getting a processor that frankly in my experience, doesn’t have any issues with heat unless there’s something technically wrong underneath, and not to mention this is only around 100 dollars??100 dollars?? Next to a 60 dollar case, 250Dollar GPU, 80 dollar PSU, and various technical things like fans and ram, this is definitely a budget friendly CPU that gets you into that pc market. Just don’t expect to play anything too physically demanding.On BeamNG drive I can spawn about 4 vehicles before frames start to dive.Stormworks can play on low settings relatively well as of writing this review!And while I’ve seen reviews stating this processor can 60fps GTA 5, I’m here to say in my experience it doesn’t, it’ll get around 40-50 in city. Maybe 60 out of the city with minimal chaos, and that’s on medium graphic settings which kinda bummed me out a bit as I had read this processor could do well on there, however my gpu could be to blame.ANYWAY, I think this CPU is the perfect price for the performance, it’s also overclockable however I have not done so myself as my motherboard doesn’t support it.Be wise in pairing this with a good GPU as the processor is definitely weak without one to help back it up.

Its pointless buying a cpu more expensive than this if you will do gaming at a 60hz monitor
","

  extremely fast considering how much you paid for, im actually using this with a gtx 1080ti since i wanted to know how far could this go comparing to a skylake i5, my 1080ti its running at 70-80 percent in most games without maxing out the anti aliasing, with games with super sampling anti aliasing you can use the 1080ti at 100% even with overclock, you will play virtually all titles at 60 frames per second no matter the resolution, since the resolution only taxes the gpu, the only two game that couldnt run at 60hz stable was Rise of the tomb rider in geothermal valley, and the evil within 2 in some scenes, the rest of games like crysis 3, the witcher 3, PUBG, etc, runs perfect. The only complain was the memory compatibility, its a pain in the ass if you dont have enoght knowledge about overclock and timings, sometimes you hare using it at 2933mhz for 1 week and suddenly its not stable anymore, sometimes it doent recognize the dual channel, it appears the two sticks in the bios but in the system appears like “system memory reserved” one of tour entire stick of ram.

Best Budget CPU
","

  Knowing me and my salary- I always go for the cheapest option. Now let me tell you something before you decide to purchase this CPU. The Ryzen 1200 is overall an excellent budget gaming Processor that everyone with a small budget can enjoy. But don’t expect much from the Ryzen 1200. She may be powerful but she can’t win every fight. Of course, there’s the option to OverClock which I recommend. But don’t be dumb and push it pass 3.5GHz unless you have an aftermarket CPU cooler. So, do I recommend buying this for your future rig? Of course. If you’re on a budget. But if I were you I would save an extra $50 to get the Ryzen 1600.

This CPU rocks!

  I'm definitely happy with this CPU. I have it rocking a 3.7 Overclock on the stock cooler, and paired with ma 3gb GTX1060, and my oh my, I'm getting 110~ fps in Overwatch completely maxed out. Video editing has also been a breeze with this CPU, if you're on a budget I'd totally recommend getting this CPU, however, the prices for Ryzen CPU are dropping significantly if you move up the ladder. You might be lucky to find a R5-1600 for 179.99. (Current MicroCenter Pricing)

Ryzen 3 is a perfect CPU for people who do casual gaming
","

  I have always used Intel CPUs, but it is time to give AMD a try. As a computer enthusiast I have to say, Ryzen 3 is a perfect CPU for people who do casual gaming. If you want a decent PC at roughly 400-500 USD, this is perfect.  This CPU can handle games such as LoL, Dota 2, Overwatch, and more with little ease. Definitely also consider 1300X, it is only 20 USD more.

  The Ryzen 3 1200 is a great budget cpu. It's a very solid choice compared to what Intel's offering. AMD allows overclocking out of the box so you can easily buy this cpu and overclock it to get the performance of a Ryzen 3 1300X cpu, saving yourself $20.
