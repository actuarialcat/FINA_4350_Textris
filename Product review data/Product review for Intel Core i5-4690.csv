The i5 is perfect for my needs
","

  The i5 has always been my processor of choice. I don't need the i7, and I'd rather have the reliability of Intel over AMD. The i5 is perfect for my needs. Heavy gaming, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, Flash, Illustrator, InDesign all run flawless. No issues with heat on a ThermalTake NiC F4 cooler, even when utilizing my SLI setup. Never goes over 65C. I highly recommend for gaming, as the i7 is simply not needed. It's been proven that the i7 only gives a 5-10% increase in performance over the i5 because games are not utilizing more than 4 cores at this time. That small performance increase is just not worth the extra $110+ for me.

Won't be buying from BeachAudio again
","

  Ordered from BeachAudio:  I won't be buying from BeachAudio again.  What I received was a tray chip, not a boxed chip.  Tray chips are sold in bulk to system builders like Dell or HP and don't have any warranty to speak of.  Tray processors are cheaper, this item is full price.  All my tests have worked so far, but based on the items photo and part number, I was expecting a boxed processor not a tray processor.  I can't speak to other sellers, YMMV.

Intel Core i5-4690 Processor.
","

  With the demise of Windows 7, I thought it would be good to get acquainted with Windows 10 and build a system for it.I chose this processor for the reason it was not a ""K"" model so there would not be a large heat factor, it cannot be overclocked, but who needs it with 3.5 GHz. forward. It runs cool and runs hard. Temps are in the middle 20c. Put it on a Asus Z97 board which has expired already.This CPU supports 1333 and 1600MHz memory natively. The taller speeds you have to monkey with the BIOS.Also supports many office type applications.  Contains Intel 4600 graphics which are fine for every day use. The price tag was very good.Fast and a lot of fun while it lasted. Ordered another board, I be up again shortly.Delivered on time, packed well.

  I downgraded the game score because this is the older single-thread-per-core i5 while the newer ones are two threads per core and thus much quicker.  Otherwise, used or not, the CPU was at least like-new and went in easily and is functioning well.

The i5 is perfect for gaming and with be able to stand up to games for a long while.  Its a perfect middle class processor delivering excellent power for the price.  Plus pairing and Intel processor and a SSD give a start up time around 2 seconds.  Definitely cant complain about that.

  After I finally got it, was stoked to install and get to checking out how my games ran. I was using an AMD FX Vuschera 4.0ghz before with quad core, and had the gigabyte 970 8GB of ram, on arma 3 I would normally get 20-45 FPS at 1920x1080p. After I put together my new pc which uses the i5 instead of the FX, all other hardware, minus motherboard, stay the same, I was getting between 45-70 FPS at 1920x1080p. I checked the FPS based on a Breaking Point US Servers and used nvidia shadow play for the FPS Counter. Needless to say, I am very happy that I finally got this processor, and since I don't intend to Overclock, this is perfect for me. If you intend to overclock, and don't need hyperthreading, you may check out the i5-4690k.

  This processor is worth every penny. I do a lot of Video Converting, and it was a pain having to wait 30 mins to convert a 25 minute video. Now with this processor, I can convert a 25 minute video in 3 Minutes! if that gives you any idea as to how fast it is. That turbo boost kicks in and she just starts flying! Every other task has been surprisingly fast as well. This thing just blows right through everything I throw at it. I mainly bought it for gaming but, I do also convert videos A LOT so this processor is good for everything I needed it for. I haven't actually gotten to play any games using it yet, but I can tell just by how much of an improvement it is over my last CPU, that games wont be an issue for this processor.Here's some of what I have on my PC right now.- OS - Windows 8.1- CPU - Intel i5 4690 3.5 Ghz- RAM - 8 GB DDR3 1600 Mhz- Motherboard - MSI Z87-G45 Gaming- PSU - 620 Watt- GPU - Integrated Graphics Motherboard/CPU (No Graphics Card yet) Picture looks GREAT!---------PROS---------Incredibly FastRuns through everything I throw at it with easeSuper quietVery solid 3.5 Ghz with 3.9 Ghz Turbo that automatically kicks in when needed.If you're not looking to overclock, this is the one you want.--------CONS---------None.

This processor is amazing!

  I'm using it in a PC running Windows 2012 Server R2 with 16GB (soon to add 16GB more) RAM and 4 HDs.  I'm hosting 4 Win 8.1 Hyper-V VMs on it while using it also as a front end of a HTPC and notice no performance issues whatsoever related to the processor.VM1 is a PLEX video server (for Rokus and Chromecasts) and ""NAS"" (just a Windows 8.1 share) to deliver videos to XBMC front end running on the server host OS itself.VM2 is my son's PC, accessed at his desk via a Wyse thin client.VM3 is my PC that I use for all my personal stuff, accessed via anything I have my hands on at the moment (Chromebook/Windows laptops, android tablets/phones, etc.).VM4 is used as a downloader and hosts any other types of server software I need to run.I also installed another NIC for better network performance.  The only performance hit I noticed was because the VMs were all hosted on one HD and my HDs are normal speed.  I moved 2 of the VMs' VHDX files to a different HD and BAM!  All VMs are now super fast.  I'm barely teasing the power of this processor and probably could have got away with an i3.  But I always like to leave some elbow-room so I'm very happy.

  Great Chip for a great price when I got it.  Works well with my HTPC setup.  Performance wise its still marked higher than most AMD chips.  Reasons I went with AMD for 10+ years was the cost.

When I originally switch over from Intel to AMD besides price AMD's ran cooler compared to the Pentium 4 chips and what not.  Now Intel has the performance and lower wattage compared to anything AMD.  I have only seen AMD chips with more cores and higher wattage and sometimes in the top 5 in benchmarking spots from my research.  http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-5.html I still like AMD but rather pay for performance and lower wattage.

9Ghz Core i5 seem like a terrible deal

  For the price, the 4690 is hard to beat. You'll find Core i5 processors with significantly (10%+) lower base and turbo boost clocks for $10-20 less, so it's hard not to spring for the 4690. In fact, that may be it's biggest downfall - that it makes a $180 2.9Ghz Core i5 seem like a terrible deal.Be sure to check your motherboard's compatibility. The Z97 chipset supports these Devil's Canyon CPU's, but some x87 series socket 1150 motherboards may flat-out not work with one of these (4690, 4790) installed.

  Fantastic processor all around that runs very cool for the performance it puts out. It can do everything I throw at it and if all you are doing is gaming do yourself a favor and DO NOT get the i7 or Xeon. Many games only utilize at max 4 cores, but usually just 2 if that. Games benefit from higher clock speeds and not more cores. If you want a processor for only multimedia/production/video editing this processor will work, but you will see much bigger performance gains with a quad core Xeon or i7 with hyper threading and at least 8 or more virtual cores. AMD is a decent choice at the sub $100 level or so, but after that, even if you have to pay a little more upfront you will earn it back on your energy bill. Especially with haswell your computer will run so quickly reliably was well. All around you can't go wrong with this processor for gaming.

Great CPU, although I haven't done to much to upset it.
","

  Although Amazon was slow getting it to me, it was worth the wait. It has worked perfectly and I have had no issues. I do sometimes wonder how my life would be different had I got the 4690k. But this chip allowed me to stay with a smaller PSU and stock cooler so it saved me some money on my build. And this operates at very low temps inside of a cooler master 110 elite with no additional cooling, for those of you doing a smaller build. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid-range processor that is compatible with many affordable motherboards.

Great processor for the value.
","

  This processor has been working like a champ for around a year. It is able to handle all of today's games including Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Infinite Warefare, Doom, etc. Who is this processor for? I believe it is just for gamers. Now, if you're a streamer, or a video editor, or anything that uses a lot of cpu power than i recommend a little stronger cpu but this one works great! It also runs fairly cool. When idle it sits at around high 20s or low 30s. When on full load, it runs at around 67-73 degrees. That's with stock fan and my room being a bit on the warm side. Totally in love with this processor and recommend it a lot if you just need one for running games.

  Great processor if your not looking to overclock!  I paired this CPU (core i5-4690) with an asus h97-plus mobo and 8gb of corsair vengance RAM and couldnt be more pleased!  This is a HUGE step up from the core 2 quad I had before!  I do a lot of video editing and converting and this took a normal 30 minute conversion job and turned it into a 3-5 minute job. If your not looking for gaming graphics the onbaord cpu graphics are also very good!  I would definitely recommend this CPU!

  This CPU was an upgrade from my sandy bridge i3. Although they both run around the same clock speed GHz wise this CPU is far more efficient for gaming and multitasking. Gaming is where I noticed it the most but even daily desktop music, surfing, graphics editing is way smoother.

Great processor, but go for k version.
","

  As a locked processor, the i5-4690 is a great choice for someone who either isn't capable of overclocking with their motherboard or someone who simply doesn't need to overclock. The price difference between this and the 4690k isn't that much, and looking back, I'd go for the 4690k over the locked version, although this processor is still blazing fast for pretty much anything you throw at it.

Good upgrade to a gaming pc

  I bout this cpu to help my Dell computer get better frames per second in gaming and it worked. I get 45-90fps on most games using high settings with a low cost R7 360 graphics card. Only thing I regret about this is not getting the overclocked version, Cause I can imagine How much more performance I could've gotten out of it.

  This Haswell processor shines! It is low energy consumption, yet one of the quickest on the market. Because it's Haswell, it handles video better than previous generations of Intel. I put this on an ASUS H97 and I have the perfect, yet relatively inexpensive and energy efficient, home theater PC. Anime fans: this processor handles 10-bit AKA Hi10P with no problems. Also should work fine for 3D. It should also be fine for media editing and even gaming, though the most hardcore gamers may be looking for something that overlocks.ONE NOTE: I have a small room and found the included fan made a sort of wailing sound that was annoying. I replaced with a Noctua Silent Cooler.

  I was one of those people that thought Windows XP was the only operating system worth having and was cruising along with my Core2Duo machine that did everything I expected it to until I built a new PC with this thing. I feel like I stepped through some time portal into the future. This is a very good processor for running Windows 8.1 and this might just be my imagination, but my display looks sharper with the on board graphics than it did with the previous HD6450 dedicated graphics card. I only wish it was a bit cheaper so that I could buy a couple more.

  Well.. im at a loss with this one. I like it and it runs great. That said, my 3570k overclocked can keep up with this. If you want no overclocking, drama free fast at a low cost this is the chip you want.. But, for $30 more you can get the 4690k and really fly.

  I will say after using both AMD and Intel computer builds off and on for years. The power efficiency of Intel cpus rock. As for mind blowing performance over a top Amd cpu it's only a few seconds here and a few seconds there faster. It's a solid cpu for sure. but, I don't feel it's worth what they are charging vs amd pricing. Most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference in real world usage. With the exception of video coding and or graphics rendering. Where intel has a ok advantage in speed not mind blowing,  but a advantage none the less.

  This will be used for a long time. People still game on i7 920's and with Vulkan and DX12 benchmarking well, these CPU's are going to last a long time now. It's in my friends computer but compared to my 4770k the general experience is no different. Checking benchmarks, the difference in performance in games is limited to only a few games that truly scale well with more threads. So far I've heard no complaints from him as he plays games or works on improving his ability with the Adobe Creative Cloud, Blender, or Unity game engine. The thing is a beast and will most likely last a long time. If anything, the thing will last forever if used as a general usage PC like how my parents use my old Phenom II 925 PC.
