3240 vs 3225
","

  If you have or plan on getting a GPU, get this CPU. If you don't, get the i3 3225. The graphics on this are HD2500 while the graphics on the i3 3225 are HD4000. There is a 33% difference in graphics from articles I've read. If you're planning on installing a GPU, this is a better card to get. There are GPU's on Amazon for as low as 30 dollars with 10 dollar rebates if you don't want to spend a lot. At that point, you'll have better graphics than HD4000. I'm using this with last years 650ti and a 450 watt PSU, and am getting nice results (no bottlenecking). If I were to start today on a new build, I'd pair the 3240 with a 650ti Boost. From what I've read, once your GPU gets too powerful, bottlenecking will occur with an i3.As far as comparing this to the i3 3220, CPU World did a comparison:3240 advantages:3240 performs 3% faster in single-threaded programs.The Intel Core i3-3240 microprocessor performs 3% better in multi-threaded tasks over the 3220.Memory performance of the CPU is better.The Intel i3-3240 has 2% better price/performance ratio than the Intel Core i3-3220.3220 advantages:noneMy Mini ITX setup with this chip (to fit into a BitFenix Prodigy*)

Final Note: This is NOT a GAMING rig. This is a rig I put together with components I used from previous builds that were later upgraded.  If you are looking into building a game to play BF4 on, I suggest this PSU, an i5 with a 650ti Boost (or wait for the 750ti). With that said, I have played many games on this rig, and the graphics are 10 times better than a game on the PS3. I don't intend to play any graphically challenging games on this rig though. Always check out the recommended specs on Steam/Amazon for the game you like, and you'll see this CPU, and a decent or even inexpensive graphics processing unit can handle many, and as long as you have a decent power supply unit(PSU), you can upgrade later to a better GPU. The upcoming 750ti may or may not require a 400 watt PSU.

Fast CPU at an affordable price.

  I bought this processor for a budget build and it's performing beautifully. I love Intel's i-series processors. My gaming PC has an i7-3770 and it's amazing, but I paid quite a bit for it. This i3 processor while certainly not as powerful costs 60% less and is still quite fast. It has enough power for most people anyway. Unless you're getting into really heavy gaming or very demanding multitasking, this CPU will easily handle everything you throw at it. It may only be a dual-core processor but with Intel's hyper-threading it will still multitask basic applications well. As for the integrated graphics (HD 2500) they are actually pretty good. Certainly not designed for gamers (if you want to play modern graphic intensive games you HAVE to buy a decent video card) the integrated graphics still work well for most applications and even older games. Skyrim probably would look pretty bad but from what I've seen and tested I think Oblivion would look OK. More than enough for any office or media PC, and if nothing else, it's nice to know if your video card dies, your integrated graphics are still good enough that you can comfortably use your computer for everyday tasks up to casual gaming.

Fast and Reliable for Cheap
","

  I use to be all about the numbers and tell people 'Get the Intel i7 or i5, i3 is weak.' Now that I built my first PC, I realize it's not all about numbers. I'm also not a real in-depth guy who can tell you everything about this processor but I know it's fast and cheap lol. I'm using a Samsung EVO 840 120GB SSD and my computer is just fast. I also have 8GB of RAM to boast. Max RAM on this is 32GB so be careful for those trying to put a 64GB RAM in here. Also make sure how much RAM your MOBO can hold cause mine can only hold 16GB RAM. Depending on what you do and if you can afford a better chip, do it. I feel Intel does a great job of marketing their chips to make it look as if the i3 is not what you want and you should at least get a i5 for your computer to be good. I think this processor is just as fast and reliable as the others when you perform 2 task. Anymore then obviously the i5 and i7 will smoke this. Don't let me persuade you, try it yourself.

  okay boys and girls.  This is a i3 processor with cooler.  The cooler is stock but it is quite quiet and keeps my NOT overclocked PC perfectly happy.  I would suggest a beefier cooler system if you were to install this on a PC3/DDR3 compatible motherboard because you will automatically be running this in the upper 10% of it's limit with no over clocking.  Again, it needs a better cooler, but even without the cooler this processor is champ.  It runs every single app, and network cache program that I need it to, and every game I have thrown at this configuration has never even slowed down...I recommend using this with the Gigabyte 1155 Intel B75 mobo, because the features of that motherboard, the quality of it and this chip and the combined specs make for a superb, and inexpensive machine.  This might not have the core clock speed of the i5 and i7 but for the price this is more than better for a box for any beginner.  Total on my build complete with 24inch monitor, speakers, kb, mouse and all the internals including dual 1tb sata iii drives was just shy of 650...best deal ever.  Will buy again.

Best i3
","

  I know it's only an i3, but as far as i3's go, this is the one to buy if you are going to go in that direction. First off, I compared processors on Passmark before purchasing this. This one had bench marks comparative with the i5s (not quite as good, but close). I think the Windows 7 rating for this is like a 7.2. My i5 2500k is a 7.5 Windows 7 Rating. I used this as a cheap replacement for an Zambezi 8-core processor and board which overheated and died tragically. Believe it or not, this processor does pretty much everything that the Zambezi did. Of course Zambezi's were not that good and were quickly replace by Vishera due to there slow speeds and overheating tenancies. Note, if you have an eight core Zambezi, I would definitely place a liquid cooler on it.You looked here for a review for an i3 and you got an AMD tutorial (LOL!). Yeah, I am satisfied with the i3 even though I'd rather have an i7, i5, or Vishera. It's a very good processor for the price!

Bang for the buck CPU - love it!

  What can I say? 3rd generation Intel Ivy Bridge technology and Intel HD 2500 graphics. Not a gaming machine, but with a decent add-on graphics board you could, I suppose. This is dual core at 3.4ghz, with hyperthreading for 4 virtual cores. Sure you can pay more, but do you really need to?I've built two computers in the past year based on this processor. Teamed up with the ASUS H61-M/A-USB3 motherboard, this is a bang for the buck machine.I'm running Ubuntu Linux 64-bit host, 8 gb ram with Virtualbox on one. Can run multiple VMs at the same time.The other PC is running Windows 7 32-bit with 4 gb ram (3.46 gb usable). It chews through Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom in a flash. Also runs multiple virtual synthesizer plugins with Cakewalk Sonar and never hits max CPU.The only thing maybe slowing this CPU down is the SATA hard drive. May need a SSD drive soon!

  I used this processor to upgrade the Windows Home Server 2011 machine I built earlier this year. Moving from 720p video downloads to 1080p, I noticed the Pentium G860 was getting hit pretty hard when transcoding the ones that weren't in a format I could directly play on my devices. Since I plan to start ripping Blu-Ray discs on my home server, I figured I better upgrade the processor.I am very happy with the Core i3-3240. So much so, that I am going to add some new roles to my home server to make use of the added processing power. If you have an LGA 1155 system that has a Pentium or Celeron processor, you should upgrade with this processor right now. You'll be glad you did!You don't need to spend much to get more than adequate performance anymore. This little Ivy Bridge Core i3 packs some real performance for not much coin, and is a great buy.

Great Power per Price Point
","

  There are much faster, pricier processors on the market, but this one can handle most anything you throw at it... I'm not a gamer, so I don't have any real need for an expensive processor, and most of the PC's I build are for companies that also do not need a power house of a pc. That in mind, These i3's are great for cheap custom builds with great room for expansion and upgrades in the future.More power than most consumers are going to need, and a good cheap alternative to the i5 and i7 for those that can get by with a little less processing power and speed.Pair with 4 sticks of some decent ram (1600) on a $80-$150 Asus board and you've got a good build started....

cool, quiet and fast
","

  I installed it in my homemade Windows Media Center unit. I wanted something that was fast enough to handle the demands of Media Center, but also cool enough that it didn't require a noisy fan. This unit fits the bill. It is installed in a Barebones box next to the TV and we never hear the fan. The video quality is excellent. We don't use the processor for much besides watching video, so I can't comment on other aspects of the i3.The unit comes with an Intel-supplied fan, but I didn't use it (I preferred the Barebones fan, which is quieter). Installation of the chip was straightforward (spreading the goop over the top of the chip for the fan contact is the trickiest part--but it went smoothly).

Great little processor at a great price.
","

  I used this in my SFF form factor gaming rig alongside a GTX 660 to save a little money, and I am glad I did.  From what I saved vs going to the i5, I was able to put the money into a better graphics card.  This processor has been rock solid since I installed it.  It isn't the fastest CPU by any means, but for the price it exceeds my expectations.  I have never felt as though it was acting as a bottleneck and even when maxed out it never feels sluggish.  The included cooler is more than adequate, and the processor runs very cool even under heavy load.  I may at some point upgrade to an i5 if the prices come down on the Ivy Bridge line, but overall i am very impressed with the performance of this supposedly lower-end processor.  It is slightly more expensive than some of AMD's offerings however the low temperature and rock solid stability are worth the premium.

  I had to return the first one as it was burnt out. I replaced it locally and it works great. I personally like the Intel more now and have completely switch over from the AMD. Reasoning is heat.

Installed and worked like a champ.
","

  No pins, no fuss...I installed it in to the motherboard, added memory, put it in the box and it worked right the first time.  And has been working great ever since.  Not as fast as my i7 of course, but seems to handle most things well.  I haven't been running it long, but no complaints so far.  I would use it again in other computers.

Great CPU
","

  I just upgraded my system for a a core 2 duo 2.6 to a I3 3.4 wow what a difference. I went from a 5.4 to a 7.4 in the windows benchmark. I will eventually go to a quad but did not have the money what with all the other parts I needed to buy. This is a great CPU for a $130.

  I am happy with it.  I used it in a build that runs Windows XP (you just have to find a motherboard that has drivers).

  Working great in my HTPC. It's a low end model so you get what you pay for but it still puts some pep in your binary step.
