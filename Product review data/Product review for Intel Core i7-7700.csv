Very happy with this CPU.
","

  I bought this Intel CPU after many years of using AMD. I didn't buy the ""x"" version as I was on a bit of a budget. That being said, this processor exceeds my demands and runs cool with the included cooler. I was using an AMD 8340 in the same case and had to go to a Corsair liquid cooler to keep CPU temps down in the 50 to 60 degree Celsius range. After pushing full detail on a hard race in Project Cars then checking temps right on Corsair Link, the temps are never over 42 c and come down to the mid 30's quickly. Plus the fan is quiet. Most of the noise in my system comes from the GPU. All in all, I am very happy with this CPU. It may not be the newest chip out there but it is doing exactly what I need it to do and then some at a price and noise level that is impressive.

Easy Upgrade for Z270 Chipset
","

  I decided to boost my gaming PC CPU power as the main game I play, Skyrim, runs a lot of scripts in single thread. It also has a Quick Sync for video transcoding if you need that.  The CPU is not overclockable, but it runs cooler than the K version. It's the fastest CPU for my Z270 motherboard, and should last me 2-3 years before I need to upgrade it.Of course, I said that 18 months when I built the system, so we'll have to see.I dinged the processor price as  it was released a few years and the price should have dropped more by now. That's probably why AMD is so popular now.Still , it's a solid CPU upgrade that can be installed in a few minutes. I recommend buying it as an upgrade , but for a new system I'd look at Ryzen or a newer gen Intel Core Fam CPU.

The great song writer and astrophotographer!
","

  Great processor working Pro Tools and Cubase. Fast and stable. Software synths and samples load fast, chews through projects be it keyscape or ominsphere, kontakt player etc... without sweat. This multi-tasking marvel, also works a charm in astrophotography, working as a tracking system controlling a apochromatic triple refractor telescope.This processor i7-7700, comes with the intel stock cooing fan which is more than sufficient to cool this processor.  So you may not need to buy an aftermarket cooler.... i did... I chose to go with cooler master's g100m because it is gorgeous and silent in the studio, all the while, putting on a led light show in the studio while writing music and editing videos or tracking galaxies.  it helps bring some color in the usually dark studio environment and it keeps the i7-7700 cool even under load while maintaining silence in the studio.  For what I do, the intel core i7-7700 is a great song writer and a wonderful telescope tracking system.  Thank you Intel!

This line of CPU's is great for everything
","

  These cpus are incredibly nice, Intel's cpus are working better than ever and they are amazing for anything from gaming to casual use, and even things like high end gaming and processing like video editing. All of these cpu's are incredibly easy to install so that shouldn't be a problem for people. It comes with a cpu fan so that's a nice bonus but it is good to know what you are going to use it for, if you are going to be doing a lot of demanding be sure to get a better cpu fan to keep your temperatures low.Over all these CPU's are great for gaming and general use, the power you get the price is definitely worth it if you are looking for high end performance across the board.

Very good performance.

  This is a good processor. I can't say that the ""generational improvements"" make it so much more superior to other i7 processors I have, but it is good. I suppose if you lust after specifications and always have to have the newest/best/greatest, you'll want more than 4 cores/8 threads, but for me it was fine.

  I almost bought the i7 7700K, but decided to go with the non overclock last minute.

Great CPU for those who do not plan on overclocking
","

  This is my first i7, which I upgraded from FX 8350. The difference is night and day when it comes to gaming. I no longer have any stuttering with Company of Heroes 2. My only complaint about the i7 7700 is that it runs a little hotter than my FX 8350. Idle temps for the i7 7700 are in the mid to high 30's Celsius, while my FX 8350 idles at around 25 Celsius. I've tried both a Corsair H60 and a Cooler Master 212 Evo with similar results. The higher heat of this i7 isn't a big deal since it peaks around 60 Celsius during gaming and this CPU has a max around 100 Celsius. The performance is smooth regardless. The heat is the only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars

  So I bought this cpu and this motherboard https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MT5WRBJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It uses the Z270 chipset and the cpu says it works with LGA1151 sockets with the 100 or 200 series chipsets.

Buy a Ryzen instead
","

  I bought this processor because it was the best chip that my old motherboard would support. I'm regretting it now, I should have got the i7-9700K and just spent the money on another board. Then I could have got 2 more cores for the same price. But besides that I am happy with this chip. I was running a 2.8ghz dual core celeron before this chip so doubling the cores and clock speed is a great experience. This chip overclocks to 4.9-5.0ghz with proper cooling and silicon lottery considered. Im running this chip at 4.8ghz with the stock cooler (my house is cold) but Im planning on getting an AIO liquid cooler before I push the overclock any further. If you have an old motherboard and this is the best chip you can run, then it still might be worth it to get Ryzen and a AMD compatible motherboard. Its worth it to go AMD now.

Good CPU
","

  Bought this to build my new FreeBSD box. It runs surprisingly cool, but then again I have a Noctua cooler on it that is the size of a Chevy small block V8. Even when compiling 6 builds at a time, it never gets over 50c. Surprisingly fast for code builds as well. My dual hexacore Xeon machine builds 700+ packages in about 3.5 hours, this machine in about 4.5. Not bad for only 4 cores.I am not a serious gamer so the onboard 630HD plays my 10+ year old games just fine. All in all, this was a good CPU choice, both because it ""just works"" and because of the low wattage, heat and power consumption.

Upgraded from an i5-6500, not really worth it

  It fixed my problem with games performing under 60fps, but that’s about it. I should’ve done more research before spending over $300 on this and just built an entirely new PC.Other than that, it’s a good cpu for the time, but my Ryzen 3700x is a lot better and that came out not too long after I bought this i7. Even when it came out, if you already have any i5 or above for this socket, don’t waste your money upgrading unless you can find the k version of this for under $150. Just get a new motherboard and buy a newer cpu. It barely made a jump 10-20fps jump from my i5 6500. I would not recommend this new,Especially today.

  I bought this processor for my new PC build quite some time ago (at least 5 months plus at the time of writing this) and I paired it with a GTX 1070 ti... Every game I've been able to play at 1080p at well above the 60 FPS mark at Ultra settings. But, for the price, I would recommend getting it used, opting for an AMD chip, or waiting for the next few processor generations to pass, or opting for something newer.

Excellent Processor
","

  I had a perfectly good running computer that was using an i5-2500K, which was an awesome processor.  It never gave me any problems.  However, the opportunity presented itself where I could resell that compute at a reasonable price and use that for an upgrade.  I sold my computer in August 2017 and knew that Intel was releasing something soon.  I was totally prepared to wait for the new processors to come out.  I wasn't in the need for a new computer.  I had other means of getting on the Internet and getting work done.  To get to the point, after seeing the i7-8700K creep up in price day by day, I looked at other processors just for the fun of it.  I saw that this 7700 was on sale for $259.  Knowing that I would never come close to maxing out the 7700, why spend the extra money on the new 8700K?  At the time I bought this processor, the 8700K was going for $419.  Also knowing that the 7700 released earlier this year, I didn't see a major drawback to getting this processor.  It has run very smoothly.  I have not been disappointed going with this processor at all.

  Ok, to be honest I did not want to rate this so low, as judging on the reviews I'm sure it is a great processor. However, my issue is that I received the processor and it did not fit the socket. I bought it alongside the ASUS STRIX H270F Gaming Motherboard which is compatible with LGA1151 chips. I called ASUS to verify that there weren't some strange outliers in the I7 processors that were not compatible, and they confirmed that this chip should be compatible. However the chip seems to not fit at all, and the arrow that should be on the bottom left corner, with the indents on the top left and right do not appear to be in the correct places. The indents are in the wrong place, causing the chip to not fit.I rated it two stars rather than one because I have used Intel in my builds for years, and I trust the company, and I understand this is probably a mistake, and I also had great support from Amazon, so I was able to get a refund and re-order this chip with the hopes of getting the correct chip. I hope that the new chip fits correctly, and I hope that if not, then proper specifications for either the motherboard or chip show others if it won't be compatible.

Very good processor, but hate the ""supported OS"" games
","

  I've been a die-hard AMD supporter for decades and probably built over 100 systems using their chips.  For a budget server a client of mine needed, I opted for this and a Gigabyte AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 motherboard to take advantage of NVMe drives for insane speeds.  Since we don't need to overclock, this locked processor is fine.We opted for Windows Server 2012 R2 instead of 2016 because of licensing costs.  What I didn't realize is that this still-supported Server OS doesn't support this chip fully, and you get a very annoying, large window that pops up *constantly* to remind you that they don't want you running this chip on that OS.  Everything runs fine, so the notices are nothing more than a major annoyance.  I'm just sick to death of Microsoft trying to force you to their latest OS instead of being consumer-centric and allowing you to choose what YOU want, and Intel plays along because it means more money for them.  AMD didn't play these games, so I'm going to give their new Ryzen chips a serious look and may just stick with them going forward if they don't play these OS games like Intel and Microsoft do.

  I want to first say that my first CPU I received was broken after 30 minutes of use and I was very disappointed but after speaking to a very helpful amazon support member they replaced it very hastily and this CPU which I am using now is very quick and good for all sorts of games like PUGB, Overwatch and even all my VR games. I was going to rate this lower because of the first mishap but because of the quick support and it running great currently I decided against it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boost in CPU power.

  I've had several computers over the years with several processors. Mostly AMD so if you've ever used both you can imagine my surprise to find that you truly do get what you pay for! This is the fastest processor I've ever used even with the base of 3.6. I didn't go for the ""K"" version because I do not intend to do any overclocking. But my computer boots fast, loads apps and programs fast and I haven't had any issues with overheating.

Best Dual Channel DDR4 processor not K series

  You can build the best desktop you can build with dual channel DDR4 with these processors, especially if it for business and you don't need to screw with overclocking. For that they have the K version. I've owned a 4790k, basically the same except it only handles DDR3, for years and It is a workhorse. If you are switching from AMD to an Intel, the notice in performance in almost a joke. AMD just don't have the build quality, or internal support within the processor, to ever get me interested again. Plus 62 degrees max for a processor with the AMD, is that a joke.

This new processor has dramatically increased the speed of internet tasks on my computer.The only negative thing I can say about it is that I recently got a popup from Windows saying that because 7th generation processors do not support Windows 7 I would not get all of the Windows security updates. I'm not really worried about it and I'm just happy with how powerful this thing is.

  Works great. With HT, an i7 is a must for people that are planning to do cpu intensive work (rendering, video editing, streaming, etc.). For gaming, it's slightly overkill currently but some games out right now (and more coming) are getting more and more CPU intensive. Originally ordered a i5 7600K but, after seeing videos on the performance difference in some games, decided to lose the ability to overclock and get an i7.The only con is the price. I ordered from Amazon because I have prime and trust their customer service but other sites -at the time over ordering- had it for +$10-15 less. Some even had the 7700K on sale for $314 (price I paid here). But if anything was wrong, I knew Amazon support would be the best option.SIDENOTE:Had to get a replacement sent. The first one I received was previously opened and had signs that it was previously installed in a computer (seal broken, thermal paste residue on CPU) despite being ""new"". If you order one, double check the factory seal and the CPU in the plastic window. This is why I mentioned Amazon CS. If I had ordered this elsewhere I would be jumping through hoops for a refund/replacement (looking at you Newegg).

Do you need the K version or the non K version

  Very fast and very powerful. Run very cool and uses lower wattage. This is the very first time I ever considered an i7 and the Seven Generations supporting 2400 ram influence me. I was considering the K version but having dealt with a lot of heat and cooling issues before with overclocking I decided to save a few bucks. To some the K version would make more sense but the extra cost of a bigger cooler and ventilation case can add a hundred dollars to the budget. In all  I am very satisfied with a non K . I ran the PassMark Benchmark on it and its scores just over 11,000 points.

A hardy CPU at stock speeds.

  For a non-clocked CPU, this can still power and process really quickly but it is 8% weaker or more than a 7700K. It doesn’t matter though on stock! It is way fine to use this for max power of stock to run any game with a GTX 1070 and 1080. Really strong at multi-tasking and post-processing. Gaming is more smoother with no stutters. AMD FX-6300 bottlenecks the potential of frame opportunity and quality. This is also 50$ cheaper than the 7700K.

  When I decided to build my first computer in over 20 years I began my research on the eternal debate between Intel and AMD.  And after much research I concluded that since I was not a video editor and had no intention of ever becoming a video editor that the Intel brand would be what I would be buying and installing on my new machine.  After deciding that the next issue was trying to decide on which Kaby Lake I would be going with.  After a lot of night driving and an 80's montage I decided my heart was set on the i7-7700K.Why K?  Because it is unlocked.  Now I have no intention right now of ever overclocking but it is nice to know that if I want to that I can.  Anyways, after installing and using this CPU for a few weeks now I know I made the right choice.  This is the CPU to get right now.

So very very quiet with that cooler. idle 30-33c, heavy gaming depending on the game it stays in 60's mostly under load Doom 2016/Far Cry Primal/Alien Isolation/Shadow Mordor/Metro Last Light. Max load on all 8 threads rendering a video with effects and tones of editing the hottest it gets is 73c with the Cryorig m9i and its packaged thermal paste.Paired it with a GTX 1070 which makes a killer gaming setup and me very happy. Legendary intel quadcore with hyper threading. You want faster rendering go for more cores. For mainly gaming and general multimedia perfect! Some video editing and graphic design/art perfect! First modern Intel build, such a solid chip. No complaints. I don't overclock so this was perfect for me.I always wondered what it was like to own an i7 and what all the hooplah was about.
