  It's actually pretty fast. Seriously, don't knock it just because it isn't the latest, greatest, bestest. I definitely don't regret buying this over my usual AMDs. And don't get me wrong, I like AMD, but honestly, if you're just looking for something for steady gaming but don't wanna spend a ridiculous amount, you found it. The stock fan is meh, better than expected, but an aftermarket fan would obviously be better. It is not unlocked, so don't bother if you're trying to overclock. I've had this for about a year, and I have yet to run into anything wrong with it.

  This is an all around great CPU I bought this two years ago now and have not run into any issues I'm also using stock fan since this is not a k and not overclackable  this is a good investment if you're looking for a reliable midrange cpu, but with pics like the new ryzen line up it's kinda outdated for the price right now if you're going for highest clock speeds and number of cores

  This processor is definitely worth the purchase! I was a little hesitant about getting this CPU at first. But once it arrived and I got it hooked up it was well worth the purchase. I upgraded from a Pentium G4560 and there was a significant difference in performance. If you’re thinking about upgrading your CPU I would recommend getting this processor. If you pair this CPU with the right GPU it will perform well in the gaming department as well. Overall a phenomenal CPU!

  Decided to go with the i5 6500 versus paying the additional cash for the higher end 6600/6600K. This processor is incredible. It's just as good and I don't miss the milliseconds I could've gotten from the others. I did use the heatsink this processor came with (The higher end processors come with the chip alone) and it seemed to work out well. It was very easy to snap on the motherboard and was adequate cooling. For anyone who knows what they're doing though, it's always better to go with an aftermarket heatsink to keep your investment cooler.If you're on a budget and want to put the money elsewhere, I would recommend this processor.

Excellent mid range processor
","

  For anyone looking to build or upgrade their processor in a gaming/productivity PC, look no further. The intel i5 6500 is one of my favorite processors in its performance range. When I first installed this processor into my PC it was a breeze. I was pretty astounded at the speed, swiftness, and reliability of this processor. This processor can prove to be more than enough for most of your needs. You need it for gaming? It gets the job done right. Productivity? You got it. This i5 can handle most of any tasks you can throw at it. The price also isn’t bad at all for the performance you’re gonna get. It’s a great all around processor.After a couple years of using pretty heavily it has shown some age, however, nothing major. It sometimes will display a little lag and get slow, however, nothing to hinder performance in gaming or nothing to slow your work day down.

  I am a gaming coming from AMD, I got tired of how my games ran so I finally bought a new system.I chose this CPU after seeing reviews and videos of how well it performs, and honestly this is the best CPU by price performance on the market.This CPU runs anything I throw at it 60FPS 1080P with my Asus Strix GTX 970 on high or ultra settings. I am using the stock cooler; and it runs very quiet. Probably the most quiet I have ever heard a stock CPU cooler run. I am using a ITX board and paired this with 16gb of ram and it's a monster. The Witcher 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider on high run fantastic with this CPU, non stop 60 FPS.I have no complaints about it at all. For $200 this was a very solid deal, you maybe able to get it when it's $190 or less and that's a steal. This CPU is utterly fantastic.

  I'm assuming it's great. The inexpensive motherboard failed, but I've got a better one on the way now. I foolishly ordered the motherboard before the CPU, so wasn't able to test it within the 30 day period after ordering. The problem was that the CPU is so expensive I could only purchase it by itself. I should have assumed that the CPU was solid and waited on the purchase of the motherboard for a more timely handling of the computer build and testing. Having to buy computer parts a little at a time, doesn't always work out so well and I didn't want to have to break it up into three separate orders, but of course that's exactly the way it's working out anyway. I pay as I go, which doesn't do much for my credit rating and high interest credit cards are not a viable choice either. I just need to rebuild my old desktop from 2007 and gradually get it into another case as possible. The motherboard that's coming, will handle an upgrade to an i7 6700k, down the road, so that's encouraging at least. Mean time this i5 6500 will do just fine I'm sure.

  The Intel i5-6500 CPU seemed to be a good choice for a mid to upper level processor.  I’m expecting this to last several years.  I used the stock cpu fan that came in box.  So far, the fan is whisper quiet and the power cable easily reached my motherboard’s header.  Installation for both cpu and fan was easy.My build includes the following components:- Corsair Carbide Series Spec-01-EVGA power supply model 600W (DOA, but 2nd one works great so far.)-Gigabyte H110M-A motherboard-Intel i5-6500 CPU-16GB (2x8GB) Corsair Vengeance DDR4 (CMK16GX4M2A2400C14R)-1TB Seagate HDD (ST1000DM003)-Windows 10 Home Full Version-(Used DVD/CD burner from an older pc)

Runs Super Cool for HTPC
","

  I installed this in an aging HTPC that I use as my main entertainment hub as well as play a few video games and edit pictures in Lightroom.  This is pretty much my main computer. It replaced an AMD 9750 that always ran super hot and was a dog.  I got tired of trying to keep that thing cool so I was sold on the low TDP of this chip which I didn't need to overclock and the newest architecture.  I hooked this up with an MSI gaming 3 motherboard and 16GB of Corsair 3200Mhz memory.  The system is like night and day.  It runs super cool with the stock cooler in my HTPC case.  I ran Prime95 for awhile and it topped out around 60C.  I have not done any gaming yet but I can run every program I could find, VLC video, youtube, Plex, virus scan, tons of chrome browser tabs open...etc all at the same time with no problems.  I'm interested to see how Lightroom does as it is a pretty CPU intensive program.  I'm happy.

which is still a fine CPU itself
","

  HUGE step up from my 7 year old Core i5-750, which is still a fine CPU itself. If you don't need or want to overclock (the 6500 is a 'locked' CPU) and will not be doing hugely CPU intensive activities such as video editing, this is the best CPU for you. Don't buy into the hype of needing an i7 for gaming, Very few games currently available or on the near horizon utilize the supposed benefits of the i7 over this i5. Put the money you'll save buying this CPU over an i7 towards a better GPU and/or monitor.

  Not the fastest processor out there, but plenty fast for basic gaming, photo editing, and tons of less intensive applications.  Buying a processor, just like most computer hardware, is about getting the most performance for the money.  As of late 2015 and early 2016, this processor provides about the most bang for the buck of any out there.  It does come with a stock heat sink, but I opted for a 3rd party solution.  Packaging was typically excellent, and installation was a snap.  I have chosen not to overclock it since I don't have time to mess around with my computers as much any more.

  This skylake part is one of the best bang for the buck processor around. The lower power consumption makes this perfect for a small system where airflow is limited.

In terms of gaming performance (I tested using a 980ti), unless the game is intensely reliant on cpu (civilization, wow etc), this processor is only 3-5 frames behind stock 6700k.

  I see why this processor is rated as one of the best bang for the buck gaming chips.  It's an outstanding performer for your budge gamer.  I run mine with a Corsair water cooler.  I overclock it just slightly to 3.5 Ghz.  I did a CPU burn load test and loaded all 4 cores to 100% for 15 minutes and the CPU held up just fine never going above 38 C.  It's been running smoothly now for over 7 months.

Same experience for a better price

  I purchased parts for this new PC I'm using right now a few weeks before Christmas and I realized Amazon didn't have any i5 6600 processors ready so I downgraded to this one. i7s where really out of question since they sold out way back in November.Well I've never used other Skylake systems before so it's hard to compare. Haven't given it much hard work to do yet but as far as it goes I was able to play PlayStation 2 games on PCSX2 (including the demanding Valkyrie Profile 2 game) and if you tweak settings correctly you can get decent performance both in Hardware and Software modes.I also virtualized a Windows XP machine  on VMWare yesterday to play old PC games and the overall experience was flawless. I mean I wasn't a big fan of virtualization at all because every time I tried hosting a VM on my laptop or work machine the experience was laggy if not worse but this system I built looks good so far.The only difference I see in specs from this to 6600 is a 100MHz in processor speed which frankly I don't consider much and a cheaper price. If you are seriously into virtualization I recommending waiting until Intel sells i7 6700 or 6700K again because those have HyperThreading which will make 4 more logical cores available for your VM.

  I've never been much of one for trying to overclock my processors, so I opted to go with the locked version of this i5. It doesn't disappoint, and paired with an SSD, 16GB of RAM ,and a GTX 1060 it handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. I use it primarily for playing games (Fallout 4, Witcher 3, etc.), but it also does very well with VM's and compiling code.

Great processor for those that don't plan on overclocking

  I love this processor. I built a new rig to replace my aging FX-4130 based machine and this thing blows the 4130 out of the window. So fast and runs nice and cool with a Be Quiet! Shadow Rock Slim on top. I have no intention of overclocking(I know I can adjust the bclk, but it's not worth the hassle for me), so for me this was worth the savings over the 6600k which is only .3Ghz faster at stock turbo speeds.If anything, in 3-4 years I will try to find a nice, used 6700k once they show up cheap on the used market, but I am totally satisfied as of now.

  I have an i5 / 3570K in another gaming PC and was just going to get the 4760K version since it can be overclocked too.  BUT...I realized the 3570K I only overclocked it one (it was really snappy) but most of the time it was at the stock Hz.  I decided to save the cash and opt for the i5 / 6500 instead and I'm happy I did.  This one is snappy enough and edit video, music, etc.  It gets the job done.

  I decided to build a computer (Austin Evans' Positron 2.0) and unfortunately my graphics card came bent! I was still able to complete the build and load an OS and load Steam and other things. I decided to start downloading games from my library because my internet is slow and had nothing else to do. As a test I started TF2 and to my surprise the game got maxed out at 1080p at 85 FPS! Not that Team Fortress is much of a benchmark, source being the godly engine that it is, but it blew me away. I got this processor because it was good bang for buck and didn't expect much of it but I am more than happy with my purchase. CSGO is also handled nicely to hold me over until my r9 390 comes in the mail.

  I thought this processor would be a little faster, and less figity, but I have noticed that when you give it some good true load, it tends to come to a crawl for a few seconds. I have a few different i5's and i7's, so I thought this would be the same. My i3 I purchased for a build a month ago seems to run circles around this chip. Maybe I have it configured incorrectly or something, I will read up on it and see how it goes.

  As a first time PC builder this CPU was easy to put in. Just watch out for how much force you have to use to put it securely on the motherboard, I thought FOR SURE that I broke it (the sound will haunt me forever...) but it was fine.This CPU is the bottleneck in my current system when I play very taxing games like Battlefield 1. It might be work to bump up for some people to something a little stronger, but for me when the framerate drops to the mid 40s I can't tell anyway.

Gaming is fluid with my gtx 960, and is well worth the money.  Never buying any processor not made by intel again.EDIT: I overlocked it to 4 ghz using the MSI Z170 M3 motherboard. On 1.2v runs games stable, and fast.  Get 70 FPS with my GTX 960 on ultra settings on overwatch.

  I bought this CPU for my first PC build I am very thrilled. I bought this CPU for its capabilities. Moving on, CPU is well- protected and the fan is protected and tightly packed in the small Intel box.The CPU has a triangle on it that you match up with the array on the motherboard which is nice for a first timer like myself. Moreover, than cooler has seemingly flimsy or odd clips that hold it to the motherboard, but they are solidly planted once it snaps and rotates into the holes of the motherboard. Again, a nice stock cooler in my opinion (of limited knowledge) even though almost all featured PC builds cram buying an after market cooler down your throat. The cooler is fine for what it is,  a stock cooler that comes with thermal paste and is designed by Intel for Intel.Lastly, at idle the temperature is a consistent 29 degrees Celsius. This CPU easily handles 3D builder, Auto CAD, other modeling programs, and gaming titles such as Skyrim, Dishonored, Fallout, CS GO, GTA IV are all getting very high frame rates in highest settings in coordination with my MSI GTX 960 4GB OC.

  I thought of keeping a dedicated computer for streaming and watching movies and that should be near to my AV receiver and considered the below pointsa. The HTPC size should considerably the same size as my AV receiver. When I searchon Internet I come to know that HTPC cases which accommodates miniATX, miniITX mother boards that is suitable for my space.b. Also I have 7.2 Ch home theater system and decided that the mother broad should have 7.1 Ch output with 4 K Video support over HDMI.c. I want to upgrade the RAM later and want 4 DIMM slots.d. If I want to upgrade the storage then I should have option to add internal hard drive inside the case.e. Don't want to over clock the CPU and decided to go with H170 intel chipset motherboard with 1151 socket.f. Front panel USBg. Economical but don't want sacrifice the featuresConsidering all the above I compared Asus, Gigabyte, ASRock and cost and feature that I was expecting I end of choosing the below parts1. Motherboard: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012N6LM1Y?ref_=pe_584750_33951330This above mother board is a MicroATX board has 4 DIMM slots. This H170 intel chipset with 1151 socket board has HDMI with 7.1 Ch Audio and 4K video support along with 2 more display ports for computer monitor. Totally 3 display support. Doesn't have WIFi and Bluetooth and will not support over clocking.2. Case : http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EMSH9Q?ref_=pe_584750_33951330This case supports MicroATX mother board and comes with 300W FlexATX power supply and one case fan. The case is strong and good quality has space for CD drive and internal hard drives. The power supply cpu connector has only 4 pin, Still it is suitable for the mother board's CPU's 8 pin connector(just plugged in only 4 of 8 pin)3. CPU: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0136JON7M?ref_=pe_584750_33951330The above CPU is Intel's 6th generation processor, Supports gaming and 4K video. This CPU comes with the Intel cooler. I think we no need any third party cooler for my purpose.4. DDR4 RAM: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MMLUYQK?ref_=pe_584750_33951330As per the above mentioned motherboard that supports only DDR4 on 4 slots, better to go with DDR4 which will give faster processing of the application tasks. I bought 8+8 2 DDR4 RAM as above and kept in 2 slots for now, later I can upgrade to another 8+8 DDR4 RAM later when price drops. Mother board manual says there 4 DIMM slots supports up to 64 GB, But the processor manual says it supports 32 GB max. So I decided to stick with 32 GB max.5. SSD M.2:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY4VIPA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s04The above SSD is very tiny and go with mother board itself with m.2 connector. For better booting and rebooting and faster application response M.2 SSDs are very good and this is latest compare with SATA/eSATA.6. Operating System - Ubuntu 15 (Linux based)This OS is free and open source. It has nice look and navigation. No need to install any driver software for the above components or motherboard. The OS detects all of them fine. The media player comes with the OS doing great and able to install and play with Kodi and Plex.

  I purchased this processor for my first noob gaming rig.After about a week of use, I can say that my previous 10 years of using laptops were useless compared to a desktop processor.I have used laptops with every generation of Intel including the skylake 6300, and I am just blown away with this processor.My Build:THIS processorDDR4 2x4GBDDR4 Gigabyte MBR9 280xAll the parts I am using are stock, most specifically the fan. This processor has no lag whatsoever, and I am picky about lagging.Just buy this processor. I sense it is pretty damn future-proof.

  Great processor! This is probably the best price-to-performance ratio processor available on the market right now. It plays right along with other processors just fine and makes an EXCELLENT gaming processor.For those wondering, I have been testing this processor's onboard graphics (involuntarily, unfortunately, as I'm waiting for my GPU to arrive), and I'm shocked by the gaming performance that I've been able to get out of it. here's a couple games for reference:Black Ops III at 1080p, rendered slightly lower, on medium graphics settings - 38fps avg (not amazing, but most certainly playable)Borderlands 2 at 1080p, high-settings - 48fps or higher.World of Tanks on Medium with HD Texture pack option - 42fps avg. Again, not amazing, but most certainly playable any day of the week.Needless to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with this CPU and in a pinch, it can be used to game on its own if you're looking to save up after initial purchase for a new GPU later on. I have an older ""gaming"" ish laptop that has a GT 650m, and this plays games just as well as it does.

  If you want to build a ""budget"" gaming PC.... DO NOT! WITHOUT DOING SERIOUS RESEARCHMy review is directed towards gamers since you can run MS Word on a potato and if you do video production, the Core i-7 is the sweet spot.Now breathe, relax your mind, and manage the excitement you have garnered from the prospect of not having to pay to play online with friends (ahem! plus-live-gold), SAVE UP an extra $100 - 150 and buy this processor. I bought the AMD X4 860k, then bought the Core i-3, and finally this i-5 in a 2 week period (returned the others).Why? Because this is a much more superior CPU. It is faster, has 4 cores and a frequency of 3.20 GHZ. Also, it has integrated graphics (which is a plus weather gamers acknowledge it or not). If you want an unlocked sucker, get the 'K' version for an extra $20. I bought this because I exceeded my budget by about 30% (tee-hee). You are getting every dollar out of it. Not saying you are not getting a bang for your buck from the other processors mentioned, but after hours and hours of research, it only made sense to ""Eat the extra cost"" since I'll be doing content creation (I know, but the Core i-7 bleh-bleh-bleh). If you are in doubt, I recommend these YouTube reviewers to give detailed explanations of the or-15 6500A special thanks to the YouTube Channels, Science Review, Digital Foundry, Hardware Unboxed, Austin Evans, JayZsTwoCents.These Tech reviewers are professional and carry out extensive research and benchmarks for a wide variety of games. In fact, 'Hardware Unboxed' is my favorite because they run benchmarks for at least 12 - 20 different games! Crazy huh?My thoughts:The year 2016 is winding down and newer titles will eventually show up: you do not want to regret not utilizing every aspect of your PC to enjoy the experience. A good example is the Division which is about to bring its player base up and release content all the way into 2017. even though you can use a NOT-Core-i5 processor to run it, the game's minimum requirement is a Core i-5 2400, which is also a very good CPU as well. Its even cheaper than this (you will save about $50 or more if you don't want to spend on this)Here's my build for you to weigh the cost (PS I wasn't going for Shinny PC, but a powerhouse):Rosewell Micro-ATX Case with 400W Power Supply: Initially $38 from Amazon;s warehouse deals. Got an extra 15% discount because it didn't come with screws, hence $33 Also 400W can power most GPU's but my GPU required 500W, so i bought another PSU :(CPU:  Core i5 6500 3.2 ghz: $203 - Ouch! To the wallet, but worth every single dollar. (If it goes on sale at a lower price, I still won't be mad)RAM:  Ballistix Sport LT 8GB Single DDR4  - $42.99MOBO: Gigabyte LGA1151 Intel H110 Micro ATX DDR4 Motherboard GA-H110M-A - $49.99GPU:  MSI GAMING RX 480 GDDR5  4GB (it was the same price as an RX 470, so why not) - $199.99PSU:  EVGA 500 W1, 80+ WHITE 500W, - $35.99Time:  At lest 4-6 HoursMiscallaneous:  $45All part prices are from Amazon.com at the time of this review.My Hard Drive's were from my old computers and my monitor was also from an old PC as well. You have to understand, this is still under $700 if you add the cost of a monitor mouse and keyboard. It's twice the price of a recent console, but it will perform better. Plus, it is open ended (or ""future proof"" - don't lie the term). I can upgrade my GPU when the next Gen of consoles are released. And if I become a millionaire before then, I can upgrade to the Skylake's Core i-7 Even then, PC ports will be optimized for the masses!CONCLUSIONYou, as the potential buyer have to weigh the cost, but from my research, this is one of the better gaming PCs you can rig up right now. In fact, a pre-built PC with these components was selling for about $800 a few months ago.So, if you are looking for a budget gaming Rig, ensure you have a strong CPU and GPU. Prices fluctuate, so keep an eye out to get the best value for your money.

  decent power for the price. base clock can be changed on z170 mb's for moderate gains (+.1 -.2Ghz with stock cooler). any other chip would be overkill in most situations. if you find you need more cpu power in the future, just get some 3000mhz ram and a better cooler. this cpu can easly be pushed up to 4Ghz if done right.

It does an excellent job for an always-on backup / torrents PC accessed via RDP
","

  I have a second computer that I use as an always-on PC for torrents and as a backup for my WD My Cloud 4TB drive.This PC used to be an old Pentium 4 CPU @ 3 Ghz with 4Gb SDRAM.I upgraded to this build:- i5-6500- Gigabyte LGA1151 Intel Z170 Micro ATX DDR4 Motherboards GA-Z170M-D3H- 16 GB Crucial memory Kit (8GBx2) DDR4 2133- Corsair PSU RM650W- (existing) Corsair H80i CPU cooler- (existing) 6 years old Intel SSD 80 GB + 2x 2Tb WD 7200rpm + 2x 1Tb WD 7200rpm + 1x 250Gb Seagate 7200rpm (total 1 SSD & 5 HDD).My results are based on comparisons by observations (didn't bother with stop watches or numbers) between the old P4 setup and the new above setup:- Torrents: Building an 8Gb file from torrents (using winrar): Old P4 PC: Around 4 minutes. This i5 PC: Around 1.5 minutes. This is a very good improvement over the old P4 but I was kind of hoping to see results closer to 1 minute because the P4 and the i5-6500 are what, 5 or 6 generations apart?... BUT I have to be fair and note that this COULD be due to limitations of the HDDs in the PC and that the i5 is capable of doing a much faster job had I tested before/after using the Intel 80 GB SSD but it barely have space because it is the C drive of the build.- Windows loading: Windows 10 used to load in about 30 seconds, now it loads in just ~10 seconds (these observations are after POST screen of course).- File copying: When copying from the WD My Cloud into the computer, an 8Gb file used to take around 1 minute (i have 1GB network), now it takes around 45-50 seconds. I guess this more limited by the Hard Disc its self too, but we can still see a good improvement.So, bottom line I was not expecting wonders and demanding performance from this PC because as said above, it is meant for torrents and backing up the WD My Cloud, I really don't care how long it takes to build a file from torrent files or how long it takes to copy half terabytes from the WD My Cloud to the PC, I was forced to do this upgrade because the old hardware started acting crazy and all attempts to resolve it went down the drain hence making it useless for its purpose as an (always on) PC. In the same time, i was intrigued to see what difference in performance I will get.I was kind of expecting better results in the torrents department. Other than that, for an always on PC with tasks ran in the background while i access it using RDP from my main computer, I can't be more happy.

The sweet spot in CPU performance/cost/power consumption
","

  Fast.  Fast.  Fast.  I didn't want to overclock and didn't see the need for hyper-threading so this I5-6500 seemed to be the best there is for the money.  (The I5-6600 is perhaps 3% faster but the $20 increase in cost isn't worth it IMO).  Anyway, this processor has scorching speed at very low power usage.  I ran a benchmark and it placed this processor in the 94th percentile which is super considering that most of the comparables were from gamers benchmarking their gaming rigs.  I am using the Intel supplied heat sink and fan and it doesn't seem to need anything more. This is truly the sweet spot for CPU performance/cost/power consumption.  I am betting that this processor will last me for the next 5 to 7 years.  Sorry Intel.

Amazing CPU, Even Better Cooler
","

  As someone upgrading from a Core 2 Duo E7200, this chip is amazing. I'll let the thousand other reviews go into the technical details of the processor, but I want to specifically mention the cooling.I bought this for a brand new build, and with it I also purchased an aftermarket Cooler Master Geminii to ensure that temps stayed low. I'd heard from other reviews that some didn't even receive the stock cooler (which is ridiculous, it's 98% of whats taking up space in the box) or a few that said the stock thermal compound (pre-applied on the heatsink) was pathetic and worth the Arctic Silver upgrade. However, when I purchased this though Amazon (NOT a reseller) I got a factory sealed box with the stock cooler, and it actually works AMAZINGLY.After some stress testing, installing, and heavy game playing, I am happy to report that the highest temps I've seen so far are about 47c. At idle, I get about 25c. And mind you, I monitored this during a 2 hr game installation and a 1080p game workload. I am honestly blown away by the effectiveness of the stock cooler. Of course it wouldn't work for any decent overclocking, but for the 6500, there's no need at all for an aftermarket cooler.UPDATE - 6/6/2017Been using the CPU for mostly gaming, some AutoCad and other editing here and there, and the whole stock air setup is still working magnificently. A little note on my setup: i5 6500, Gtx 1060 6gb, 1TB Samsung EVO SSD, 16gb Ballistix RAM, and 6 Corsair AF120 fans. This CPU has not let me down once. Even under full load during stress testing for almost 20 minutes, the highest temperate recorded was 56 degrees. With a stock cooler. Wow. Knowing this though, I kind of want a K edition card now that I see the enormous overclocking headroom. So maybe I should've spend the extra $40... But no complaints, this particular unit will continue working like a beast for years to come.

  I love skylake!  Ends up this CPU can be overclocked.  Just get the a motherboard that supports adjusting the required parameters.  Also, I highly recommend a motherboard that support the m.2 hard drives such as the one that I purchased:Sequential Read: 2150MB/s, Sequential Write: 1260 MB/s, Random Read (QD=4): 300K IOPS, Random Write (QD=4): 100K IOPSLook at those transfer rates.  The bottle neck of the hard drive has been significantly improved.  With this people will begin to understand why the CPUs by intel didn't need to focus on the clockrate but what the new chip's architecture can support.  Match that with fully Vt-d capable and dedicated PCI-e bandwidth we will start to see the overall system performance have much higher performance with much less power.  This architecture is just awesome.

SKILL Ripjaws 8GB DDR4 & a Gigabyte Windforce GTX 970 and the performance is lovely, DOOM runs like a dream and never dips below 60FPS. For cooling I'm using the Corsair H60 and idle temps are around 26 Celsius, nice and cool.

Good performance, just not with windows 7
","

  I really like this processor. It's performance seems good compared to others in the same price range. You may want to reconsider getting a Skylake processor if you intend on using windows 7 though. Tried installing windows 7 using this processor in my build and my USB 2.0 ports did not function at all. If you intend on using windows 10 (and i believe 8 as well) then this can be a good processor to pick up.

The best bang-for-the-buck 6th-generation Intel processor.

  The i5-6500 is the best bang for the buck sixth-generation Intel processor @ $199, with the 6600 (non-K) version costing about about $30 more, and the 6400 version costing about $15 less.  You really cannot go wrong with any of them, and all are perfect for any reasonably-priced, robust desktop build.PRO: - Runs cooler, and consumes less power than previous generation i5 processors - on-par with previous generation i3 processors!CON: - Only modest raw performance gains over the last several i5 generations, which is probably to be expected.My Current System Build:- PHANTEKS Enthoo Evolv mATX Aluminum Case (White) - $129.99- ENERMAX Revolution X't ATX 530 Watt Gold-Rated Power Supply (ERX530AWT) - $79.99- GIGABYTE LGA-1151 Intel H110 mATX DDR4 Motherboard (GA-H110M-S2HP) - $76.99- KINGSTON HyperX FURY Black 16GB (2x8GB) 2133MHz DDR4 CL14 Memory (HX421C14FBK2/16) - $96.99- INTEL Core I5-6500 3.20Ghz LGA-1151 Processor - $199.99- EVGA GeForce GTX 960 4GB FTW GAMING ACX 2.0+, Graphics Card (04G-P4-3969-KR) - $184.99- INTEL 240GB SATA 2.5"" SSD (DC S3500 Enterprise Class) - Primary Boot/OS Drive - $159.99- WESTERN DIGITAL 1TB SATA 3.5"" HDD - Secondary Drive - $59.99- WESTERN DIGITAL 500GB SATA 2.5 HDD - Misc.

Great Performance for an i5 w/Out OC
","

  I bought this CPU to stay on a budget but still have a good performance since I came from an i7 940 first gen intel core i series. Although I am 5 generations  up now from their first, i expected a good experience and overall this chip has broke my expectations on normal computes, gaming and multitasking.  Since I can't OC and also don't expect to OC, the CPU is being cooled under a Corsair H55 water cooler and the temperatures as ever gone too high from the heavy loading I do with it. Only issue for me is when I edit videos or pictures, I have 16GB's of DDR4 ram and I still experience some lag in rendering or a slowness in rendering off my videos and pictures from the softwares I use.Highlights:- Handles a lot of normal computings- Runs cool with fan or watercooler- Haven't ran into CPU errors- Great for budget gamingCons:- You will want an i7 if you edit videos and pictures.

Very good CPU at an unreasonable price
","

  surprisingly underwhelming (albeit still fast and reliable) performance. Amazing little processor, but I wouldn't recommend it at any price over $160. at that point you'd be better off going for a Ryzen 5 1400 unless you're building mini-itx. Even then, the difference in motherboard price-CPU price in their respective chipsets are negligible at best ($160 for a ryzen 5 CPU and $110 for a B350 mini-itx motherboard vs $200 for an i5-6500 and $70 for an h110 mini-itx board, both with wifi) and you'd STILL be better off going for the ryzen platform. With 4 threads less than a Ryzen 5 1400, $40 higher pricepoint, and locked Clockrate (aside from boost speeds) The i5-6500 doesn't come anywhere close to the price-performance that Ryzen offers, and i can only recommend this CPU on sale.Initially, the CPU is very fast, but It's not terribly great. If you're going for mid-range gaming and you're just looking for something that works, This isn't a bad CPU and I'm not recommending against it. Just be weary of what you COULD be buying instead of what you're looking at buying.

Still a workhorse

  This is still a beast of a CPU for business use and general ""work"" tasks.  It won't be putting up scorching numbers on any of today's top AAA FPS games, but it is still more than respectable with strategy, RPG, flight/racing sims. It's great for heavy multitasking. I'm an IT engineer and regularly have multiple screens, apps, and VMs open doing work with this CPU.

Used This in My Build - Best $/Perfromance
","

  Gains over previous generations of Intel processors are minute and are mainly very slight speed gains paired with better energy efficiency. This card isn't a huge upgrade in specs compared to an older I5, but it is similarly priced and is the newest chipset (1151) which requires a newer motherboard which in turn supports faster DDR4 RAM.If you want to overclock your CPU get the 6600K version. If you want a good affordable CPU that will run perfectly well with a stock cooler, go with this (or the 6400 if you prefer).You DO NOT need an I7 for gaming. This is just extra money you'll be spending for VERY little (if any, maybe 1-2 frames) performance boost. Your GPU does a majority of the lifting on gaming, do yourself a favor and save $ on an I7 and go with an I5 for your build.

  I built my computer right around 2 years ago (MSI B150 MoBo | i5-6500 | Team Elite 16GB SDRAM DDR4 | EVGA GTX 150TI SSC | Samsung EVO 850 EVO 120gb SSD+1TB HDD). I mainly play games via Steam, Blizz and Bestheda. Have yet to run into an issue (almost every game will run at ultra settings with 0 problems). Run OS on SSD and Games from HDD with no issues.Easy to install even with aftermarket cooler (don't forget your thermal paste!).Highly recommend this or the 6600k. Great bang for your buck.

  It provides a cpu and a cpu fan. But the cpu fan is useless, Now we usually use more powerful cooling method for cpu. This small cpu fan provided is a waste of money and you have to buy because the factories make it, they have to sell them out and they bound cpu and useless cpu fan together! I suggest you select a product with out the small cpu fan! And buy a cooler separately.

  I got the i5-6500 with the intention of bclk overclocking on asrock motherboards. While I have no complaints so far other than needing to be really deductive with driver instability, if I where to do it again I'd probably get the i5-6400. Once you overclock the 2 chips to the same speed they will have identical performance.
