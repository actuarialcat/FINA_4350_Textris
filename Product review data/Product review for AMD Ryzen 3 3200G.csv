Review specifically for Linux OS and Ryzen 3/5 3200G/3400G users
","

  Just wanted to give a heads up to other Linux OS users.I built a system with a new ASUS Prime B450M-A motherboard, Ryzen 3 3200G, Crucial 3000 CL15 16GB DDR4 ram, a 120GB SSD and a Corsair 400W powering it all.As long as you stick to a Linux OS that has either specifically worked their OS to work with these newer chips (props to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS plus all 19* releases and Fedora 31 here), you will be ok.  Just know that (regrettably, AMD has forgotten who saved them years ago when the Intel assault was in full swing) you will not get support from AMD Linux-drivers-wise for these chips.  If you are aware of that, then you'll be good to go.  And know that these chips are not true AMD cpu 3000 releases; the true 3000 releases will come next summer).Using this chip, I watched an Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS ISO boot straight up (on the ASUS Prime B450M-A mentioned above, I cannot speak about if this is so from other board manufacturers).  Same goes for Fedora 31.What wouldn't boot for me (without jumping thru hoops and rebuilding an ISO using a Linux kernel 5 or higher) were things like:  Linux Mint 19, OpenSUSE LEAP/Tumbleweed, Debian 10.1 Buster, MX-Linux 19 and a few others I tried.  They all fail to boot because most of them are still using kernels below 5).I put this new system in the living room, for the family & kids, and it has been enduring their abuse for the past few weeks without one hiccup (knock on wood, haha) or problem.  They use it for everything, from general web surfing, multi-purpose functions, to streaming Netflix, etc, etc.  I even used the included cooler and also convinced myself (as a test) to use the included paste it came with.  Honestly, so far,  I am still surprised at the normal temp range it has been easily running at no matter what they are doing.  Though if the gaming becomes heavy (its surprising what this chip will do FPS-wise, for 720P, it just rips thru everything like butter), I may swap the stock cooler out and install one of the bigger Thermaltake coolers I have (just to be safe).Hope this review helps anyone out there worried that this chip wouldn't run any Linux OS.  AMD needs to be slapped upside the head for last years Pinnacle Ridge debacle (which turned many, many Linux users off).  Thankfully, they've made a few strides with this 3200G/3400G releases, which is welcome.  Also note AMD is still telling all 300/400 series motherboard manufacturers to ""disable"" PCIe4 (AMD might deserve another slap upside the head for this).  If PCIe4 is important to you, wait for the true 3000 cpu(s) to be released next summer.Hope this review helps any Linux OS wonderers/users out there.

Great budget CPU
","

  I built my wife a new computer to browse the web, maybe do some light gaming and to watch Netflix / Amazon Prime shows.  For this purpose, the computer is amazing.  I paired it up with a b450i motherboard (mini-itx), 16gb of ram, and a 1tb m.2 nvme drive all for about $430.  The pc turns on in seconds, and my wife can literally open like 50 tabs in Chrome and it barely even phases the computer.  Now we just need to find a cheap, tiny case to put it in... Right now it's in my old large tower and it looks ridiculous inside the case, because it's so tiny and there's no external hard drives / graphics cards, etc.I highly recommend this budget CPU.  I wouldn't bother with the Ryzen 2200g since it's only like $10 cheaper - I'd go with the 3200g for the faster speeds for only a $10 difference.  There is the headache of needing to update the bios, but I think eventually manufacturers will update the bios on other boards before sending them to Amazon, but only time will tell.

Okay, its not a Bugatti Veyron

  I love AMD, they give you a lot of choice for the the type of build you're after.  I chose this APU because it fit the budget I was trying to achieve and it had the built in graphics I wanted.  Lets face it, are there better CPU's?  Sure there are, but  this one fit my needs.  I am on an AM4 platform and built the system around that.  I can easily upgrade if I feel this APU isn't getting the job done, and do it at minimal cost.  I can re-use this APU to start another budget build later.  To be quite honest I have no issues at all with this current setup. This is a general purpose computer that performs very well and cost me under $450.00 dollars.Update:  I have used the APU for over six months now and it's been flawless.  I did add a graphics card, I went with an RX580 8Gig which absolutely took it a new level.  It increased the overall cost of my build to just under $650.00 but for me, I think it was worth it.  So, long story short, if you're after a budget build and you like AMD, this is the APU you want.

Worth it, but buy a better GPU to accompany it.
","

  I’ve always been a fan of AMD for gaming. This is a great processor to buy, especially if you’re on a budget. I did have some issues opening some games, so the GPU integrated in it isn’t quite worth it. I ended up upgrading to a 1060 GPU , now my games run incredibly smooth. Which is a major surprise with how cheap I did my PC build.My recommendation, this Processor works best with a better upgraded GPU. I’m able to run rather recent games on high graphics and still get 60FPS. I haven’t had a game that drops down in frames yet.

Good choice
","

  After extensive research, I selected the Ryzen 3 3200g for my CPU.  Because I only recently installed it, I can’t predict whether it will live up to its reputation of excellence. However, with its stock cooler, it was easy to install. The fan does run a bit louder than I would have preferred but I could easily swap it for a custom cooler if I wanted to. However, because everything is running smoothly, I plan on leaving it the way it is. (""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"")  I’m anticipating this Ryzen will be even more efficient than my older AMD CPU’s that I have used in the past. AMD’s technicians are courteous, knowledgeable, and easy to reach.  Thank you!.

Great for general use, even if a bit older.
","

  this is a capable chip and a very nice upgrade over the computers we had in our office previously, but if you are looking into gaming and/or streaming I would definitely get a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 depending on the price at the time.I paired this with an rx570 and 16gb ddr4 ram @2666mhz and was able to get a pretty decent average performance in things like Photoshop, Lightroom, Aurora, Luminar, and MS Office. Retro gaming and lower-end new games would run on this as well, but if gaming is your main focus, save yourself some headache later by going ahead with getting the R5 or R7.

Amazing APU !

   I'm building several computers to use in my dental practice and I wanted something compact yet powerful for running dental imaging software, web browsing, YouTube and practice management software. My goal was not to build a high-end gaming rig. This computer is not for overclocking either. If you want a gaming rig go build one. If you need something that runs everyday work continue reading. Also, I'm AMD fan.BUILD SETUP:1. AMD Ryzen 3 3200G with Radeon Graphics APU (4 core CPU with Radeon Graphics). 65 W TDP and max temp 95 C. ($91.95).2. Gigabyte B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI (AMD Ryzen AM4/M.2 Thermal Guard with Onboard Wifi/HDMI/DP/USB 3.1 Gen 2/Mini ITX/Motherboard) ($141.12).3. Sabrent 256GB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 Internal SSD High Performance Solid State Drive (SB-ROCKET-256)  ($46.99)4. Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz C16 Desktop Memory Kit - Black (CMK16GX4M2B3200C16),Vengeance LPX Black ($73.99)5. Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo - Keyboard and Mouse Included, 2.4GHz Dropout-Free Connection, Long Battery Life (Frustration-Free Packaging) ($20.99)6. InWin Chopin SECC Mini-ITX Tower Case 150W Power Supply with 4 colors stickers inside, Black Aluminum  ($90.34)7. 24"" DisplayPROS:1. The case has an amazing build quality. It feels premium with the black aluminum material. High quality finish and sturdy.2. Small form factor. Quite portable.3. AMD Ryzen 3 3200G is quite powerful for everything you throw at it. The nice part is that it has a built-in Radeon GPU so you can use the motherboard display out to power your displays. It supports 4K. It has 2 HDMI and 1 Display Port!4. Sabrent NVME is incredible. Windows 10 boots in 10-12 sec! Price is unbelievable.5. Built-in WiFi AC with antenna and Bluetooth 5.0. I love motherboards that have those!6. The case comes with 150 PSU. AMD with Radeon is max at 65 W so you wont be running the PSU at max. No noise from PSU and the CPU cooler fan is silent under normal operation.CONS:The case wont fit the AMD Wraith Silent cooler, without a slight modification.SOLUTION:It won't fit unless you remove the top bracket. Yes, it can fit!! It took me some time to figure it out and I wanted to share this with everyone. The stock AMD Wraith Silent cooler fits this case after you remove the top bracket from the fan. See pictures and video attached. The benefit is that you don't have to buy a separate cooler. I found that Noctua $39.90 is way too much to spend so that pushed me to figure out a solution.Plus the AMD cooler is bigger and since the fan is so close to the side panel. It will force air out of the case through the mesh.EXPERIENCE:Motherboard:The Gigabyte motherboard is incredible. The UEFI BIOS is graphics with mouse support. It came with latest BIOS revision 50 out of the box. Good job Gigabyte! (Hint: if you want to upgrade your BIOS do not do it from Windows. Always do it from the BIOS menu so no bricks). Windows 10 had no issues installing or running. All drivers installed without a problem. Radeon drivers worked out of the box. Also Miracast works on this APU with drivers 20.xx. I was able to wireless cast HDMI to a Anycast dongle and mirror my desktop.Boot time is 10-12 seconds! If your display is on standby and you push the power button by the time the monitor wakes up you're at Windows login screen. Unbelievable speed! WiFi and BT are great and coupled with 16 GB of RAM the GPU takes 2 GB and the rest is dedicated to Windows. Performance is great. It also supports Windows secure boot and other gems. Everything is so smooth.CPU Heat:Under idle conditions, the CPU temperature is around 28 C. With load you probably hit 40-50 C. I did not do extensive testing. Remember this is APU based on Zen+ architecture so it's not a 7nm APU. Hopefully, we get newer Zen 2 APUs from AMD. I love AMD !Overclocking:I do not do overclocking. My goal is usually to reduce power consumption if possible and have a quite system. The default AMD boost is way more than enough for my needs. I hate when people trash companies and motherboard because of VRM and such. If you want to overclock get a higher end and more expensive motherboard but let us enjoy those gems like the Gigabyte B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI.NOISE:Not so much. See the video. PSU does not make sound either. I tested it by unplugging the CPU fan to see. In fact that this case comes with PSU at this price is so cool. I wish more companies offer that.PERFORMANCE:If you need a computer that does everyday work you wont be disappointed. This setup is quite light and has AMD technologies. Thank you In Win Chopin for this wonderful case!

great for a low cost system
","

  This is NOT the fastest CPU you can get, but integrated graphics and a quad core processor means you can get a decent system for less, and won't need to buy a graphics card to get running. It is not fast enough for high level gaming, but basic e-sports and older less intense games should work fine.  At the price, it can help you build a very decent system for less--and compared to intel offerings, at a considerable price savings.The only drawback--any separate dedicated graphics card is going to be faster than the vega 8 graphics....so do check your budget as picking up a ryzen 3 2600 with a low end graphics card is probably a lot faster.  But if you want to get a TINY system without room for a graphics card, recommend.The ryzen 5 3400g is quite a bit faster, but more expensive (and strangely out of stock).  At that price point, you do have to wonder about spending a bit more for a graphics card.

Upgraded from AMD FX 6350 + GTX 970 Gold
","

  This was purchased for a mid performance secondary gaming PC for someone who does not need particularly high-end graphics and performance. Definitely better than most 2019 console's performance.Upgraded along with the MSI X570 Gaming Plus Motherboard from an AMD FX 6350 + GTX 970 Gold Edition, so performance took quite the jump. Especially for Monster Hunter World on medium to high with some tweaks.Based on the average bottleneck calculations, this Ryzen 3 3200G + GTX 970 are a great combination for better-than-console performance. With the Corsair Vengeance 8gb LPX RAM, this setup is quite decent for basic gaming without too much expectation for high fidelity gaming. Expecting to upgrade to 16GB if the need presents itself.Unfortunately, my first one was dead on arrival based on the motherboard diagnostics, and I noticed the second one had a circular spread for the stock fan thermal paste leading me to believe that the first one was not up to standard since it had thermal paste up to the corners of the plate leaving no allowance for the heat sink fins.On top of this, this build alone also had a defective first motherboard... Gosh... Which was totally dead. No power whatsoever. Connections, cables and psu were troubleshooted... The second one powered up though.

Good Chip for Everyday Use
","

  I had planned my entire build but hadn’t purchased the CPU yet. I was settled on the Ryzen 5 1600 refreshed processor for $85. After waiting a few weeks I realized I have to get something else and can’t wait forever. So I decided to get this Ryzen 3 3200g which is also a good deal. I was very surprised by the performance of this processor. In fact I had already bought a dedicated graphics card because the Ryzen 5 didn’t have integrated graphics. I decided it wasn’t necessary for this because the integrated graphics performed very well (I returned it). Now I have experience with AMD and the A-series processers weren’t that great, but especially the integrated graphics on those chips were garbage. In fact a separate video card is a requirement because of how poor they performed. 4 cores 4 threads might seem futile when there are 8 core 16 threads as options (ryzen 7), but for a non gamer and especially if you are upgrading from an older system, you won’t be disappointed.

Its so powerful, why do I need a Ryzen 5, 7, or 9 again?
","

  This CPU is a badass. I wasn't sure if I could use this for a game I was dying to play, Star Citizen. It's not under their recommended but meets minimum requirements. However, after overclocking to 3.8ghz with my ram at 2933mhz I can't say that I needed a higher core for it. It runs smooth, no lag, no stuttering with a crisp picture. It was a pain updating bios for the board to run but ill be adding a dedicated graphics card to elevate my online gaming library. You don't need a ryzen 5, 7, or 9 to have a great gaming experience but it stronger than the 2200G

Faster than my 2018 Core i5
","

  When I got a laptop with a Core i5 in 2018, I was afraid it was going to be too slow.  But it was faster than any processor I had before.  That laptop motherboard (Dell) , however, failed and I decided to build a desktop so I'd have more control over the parts.  When I saw the Ryzen 3, I again was afraid it would be sub-par and slow.  It was faster than the 2018 i5.  It came with the thermopaste for the heatsink already applied on the heatsink.  Just snap it into place and Voila!  It works and works great.  I didn't rate this for gaming.  I do, however, open lots and lots of web pages at the same time and this processor handles everything without a lag or any problem of any kind.  I'll bet you this would be fine for a lot of gaming.  I have a pal who is a gamer and he has that same i5 I bought in 2018 - and this Ryzen 3 is much faster than that is.

Good CPU for the Price
","

  Helped improve the FPS on games like world of warcraft and madden 20 that are more cpu dependent. It improved the frames per second by 40 or more. My main computer for about 5 years had an amd fx 8350. It was a good cpu for its time but needed a better cooler. My amd fx 8350 was always turbocharging itself ( overclocking ). The fan would make a lot of noise. It would sometimes overheat and shutdown. The only thing that kept it from doing this was this program called epu. EPU would turn the voltage down enough for it to quit turbocharging.With this new amd ryzen 3 3200G, I don't have this problem. I could not enjoy using linux on the amd fx 8350 because of the turbocharging and fan noise. Now I can use windows and linux without any fan noise and overcharging on the amd ryzen 3 3200G. It also has great performance.

Good card for a workstation or light load gaming.

  It's a solid cpu for the price.  However the RX Vega 8 graphics left something to be desired for me.  The AM4 Ryzen 3 3200G is a solid about equivalent to an i7-4770.  It does overclock nicely.  With the IGX turned off and OC'd I run a steady base clock of 4.15 GHz around 36C with the stock Wraith stealth cooler.  Works great.  If you want(or need) on board graphics though the Ryzen 5 3400G with RX Vega 11 IGX (Integrated)  is the way to go for a mere $50 more.  A little higher boost freq of 4.2MHz not OC'd and it's pretty much good to go out of the box. For $100, the 3200G does a great job for an all around solution!  For about $160 you can be on your way to a new system!  $70 in 16GB ddr 3200.  $50 PS 600watt(overkill).  $50 m.2 Nvme 250GB drive and $60 for a case with fans...  that's < $400 for a new build...  Just sayin' :^)

Excellent for budget gaming PCs
","

  I currently use Ryzen 7 with RTX 2080 gpu on my main gaming PC, and I bought this Ryzen 3 cpu specifically for my son's gaming PC.  At first I was skeptical if this might bottleneck on modern gaming titles, but I was surprised it held up pretty well.I partnered this cpu with some spare parts lying around, gpu is Radeon Vega 56, RAM is corsair vengeance 16GB dual  @3000MHz.  I didn't use any bench marking tools as they are not really exact representations of real world usage.  Instead, I just started playing some modern games including Destiny 2, COD MW, and Fortnite.  I was impressed that CPU usage was just averaging on 50% to 60% with some very rare occasional spikes.  So, I'm pretty confident that this will be sufficient for my son's gaming needs.  Even on his daily school work, this cpu is more than enough.  Now, if you are a creator that uses software that utilizes multi thread processing a lot like Adobe creative suites, Blender, CAD software, etc, then this CPU may not suite your needs and you may want to get something on the higher end.  Although this CPU can still work fine with those software, but the time to process specific tasks may take a little longer.If you will ask why I purchased this cpu that has integrated graphics instead of Ryzen 5 2600 for  20 dollars more?  Well, sometimes discreet GPUs will fail and I don't have spare anymore.  So, in case the GPU fails, we can still use the integrated graphics to cover some daily tasks like school work.Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to buy this.  Saved me some money and yet can still perform perfectly fine with modern gaming titles.

Great Choice For Budget Builds
","

  (Not a pc genius but I know the basics so if you're like me or know absolutely nothing about computers, here ya go) If you are a gamer on a budget, this is a GREAT option. My budget was $450 and I kept the full cost of my pc to around $445. If you have a slightly higher budget/like $50 more to spend, I suggest getting the Ryzen 5 3400G but if you don't play super demanding games or you REALLY don't have the money to spare, the Ryzen 3 3200G is amazing. I paired it with 16gb dual channel ddr4 ram and a 1tb hard drive and it runs great. I tried out Minecraft with Optifine and shaders because it was the first game to get done downloading and I gotta say : coming from an old i5-2320 + 16b ddr3 + 500gb hard drive, this new setup blew me away. I went from 45-60fps base game to 60-150fps+ base game. 20-40fps with shaders to 45-120fps (depending on the shaderpack). With that in mind, games like Fortnite, Sims, CSGO, Valorant, Elder Scrolls Online, Conan Exiles, and anything else around that requirement level should run well at medium settings (or higher for games like Sims and CSGO) depending on any other components you pair with this apu. One of my favorite parts of owning this apu (or any apu in general) is that if you don't have the money for a cpu + gpu combo, just grab one of these and hold off on a gpu until you can afford it. If you do add in a graphics card later on though, the performance should REALLY improve (depending on the card you choose of course). The stock cooler that comes in the box isn't great but it should get the job done until you're able to upgrade. If you just do some web browsing, watching movies/videos, the occasional small game, etc, I think this will be great for you. If you're into slightly more demanding games but okay with not having the BEST graphics settings imaginable and you're happy with medium settings and playable frame rates/low settings and better framerates, I think you'll enjoy this. And if you are into more AAA titles but can't afford the specs to play them, I would still say go for the 3400G but this is a solid 2nd place/placeholder until you can afford better upgrades. After adding a (decent) graphics card, if you feel the need to upgrade from this apu, you can buy an actual cpu to go with your new gpu which will make for an even better gaming setup.Overall I think this is a great choice for budget/entry level pc builds if nothing but a placeholder, I can see myself using this for years to come, just research the spec requirements for the games you are going to be playing. Don't buy this expecting performance from the latest and greatest pc components that are double-triple the price and I think you'll be satisfied.⭐⭐⭐⭐

  This CPU was my first AMD purchase.  I purchased this and a MSI A320M-A Pro motherboard to upgrade an old HP slimline desktop that I owned.  I use my PC for general purposes, email, surfing the web and the occasional video.  This has been great for that as this was a huge upgrade over the dual core pentium that I replaced.  I have also been very satisfied with the built in GPU that is part of this.  Knowing that it have the built in GPU, I chose to put 16gb of RAM in my system so that the GPU can take it's 2GB leaving plenty for the OS.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.

A Work From Home Beast
","

  I would argue that the Ryzen 3200g is probably the best processor under $100 for a daily driver.  This processor will mostly be used for web browsing, watching videos and webinars, editing Google Docs, and video chatting with co-workers  It will do all of those things easily.  If you find yourself now working from home and your laptop is just too cramped, this is a good processor to build a work from home desktop.If you need more CPU, the Ryzen 1600AF is the same price and has 6 cores/12 threads.  But, that processor also requires a video card as there is no integrated graphics.  If you need to process video or would like to game, buy the 1600AF and a dedicated GPU.  The 3200g is enough for what I described, but it is not up for gaming or heavy processing workloads.The 3200g shines as a daily driver.  It will easily outpace almost all laptops and can be used in a machine to give the convenience of a desktop.  Perfect for the work from home crowd.If you found my review helpful, please press that button and consider following me for more tech reviews.

Solid CPU!

  I ordered two of these, one for my Kids' new PC and one for a mini ITX build destined for emulation and couch coop gaming.On build #1:I have this running with 16GB 2400 MHz, and it's just perfect for what my kids are doing. They're using this to play Roblox and Minecraft primarily. I would recommend somewhere around 3000 MHz or greater if you're looking to utilize the Graphics on this CPU for more heavy lifting.Paired this with a Gigabyte GA-A320M-S2H - Board did not need to be flashed, it already had support for this CPU out of the box. Build is also running with Windows 10 Home.On build #2:I have this running with 8GB 2666 MHz, slightly less RAM desired but slightly more speed just because. This is running Ubuntu (with GUI) and is purpose built to display to a TV. It's been running RetroPie and is fully capable thus far of N64, Dreamcast, and PS2 emulation. Additionally, I've played around with some older/indie couch coop games utilizing Steam+Proton and it's been a blast.I paired this with MSI PERFORMANCE GAMING B450I GAMING PLUS (caps from copy and paste, sorry).Verdict?If you're looking for a super budget friendly CPU+GPU, buy this. It's a great product for a kids PC, great for a low needs PC, and just... I can't help but say I sort of love this thing.

Good choice for a budget build
","

  I did my last build in 2012 and thought it was about time I upgraded one of my home desktops that is used principally for internet browsing, watching Amazon Prime and paying the bills online.  I don't have the least interest in 'gaming' (aka sitting on one's butt for hours or days at a time).I chose this processor mainly for the price.  It has 4 processor cores and can run 4 threads 'simultaneously'.  This is more than enough processing power for the uses mentioned above.Another significant reason was that it has integrated graphics.  This means that you don't have to buy a separate graphics card for your build which is at least a saving of %150.It comes with a heat sink which is more than adequate to cool the processor.  I have two other fans in my computer case and (so far) I have never seen my PC running hotter than 47 C.  Of course, I am not doing any heavy video editing or anything else that makes CPU usage go up to 100% on all cores.Please note that this processor uses an AMD AM4 socket.  Remember this when choosing your motherboard!The performance on most of the applications listed above is great. Windows 10 boots up in just a few seconds.  (Of course, this is partly due to using NVMe storage.  I highly recommend this at least for installing your operating system.  If you wish to install this storage, make sure your motherboard has at least 1 M2 socket and that the dimensions of the storage stick are consistent with the interface on your motherboard).If you're looking to a budget build, this processor is great choice.

  Built a machine with this and an ASrock Deskmini Barebones PC for a small Security Camera Monitoring Station.Currently this is working extremely well. The entire machine, processor, board, ram and ssd cost around 350-400 usd vs a Zotac Mini PC with a Core i5 quad core PC that cost around 500-600 usd. This system beats the intel in performance despite being cheaper and the integrated graphics is a massive win.This processor is a massive win for office machines that still need a little extra oomph.I wouldn't recommend this integrated graphics for more than light modern gaming at the lowest of setting and resolutions. But it is quite good for GOG type games. Older titles from a decade ago can run on this guy with max setting no worries. It would be fantastic for a mame machine if you were so inclined.But seriously, a socketed am4 processor with built in graphics (which the higher end processors do not have) is a fantastic option for run of the mill grunt machines for internet browsing, HTPCs, headless terminals, dumb servers, etc, with a whole lot of extra power to boot.

It works well but the cooler is NOISY
","

  I finally caved and decided to upgrade my ancient (~2012) MB, CPU, and RAM along with the Win 10 upgrade.  This CPU was paired with a Gigabyte B450M series motherboard and 16 Gb of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM.  I specifically bought the combination because of the onboard graphics.  My needs are modest and I do almost no gaming.  What can I say about the processor?  It works.The cooler, however, isn't so great.  It's easy to install on a board made for the AM4 socket processors, it keeps the chip cool, but THIS THING IS NOISY!  The reviewers who said it isn't either don't know what a high quality cooler sounds like, or doesn't sound like, or their hearing is bad.  The next purchase for the computer build project will be a heat pipe unit from Cooler Master or Thermaltake.  This thing has got to go!.

Upgraded almost immediately, you probably will too
","

  It's an excellent APU to keep on hand, because it enables testing of the onboard video system of motherboards. It runs very cool and it tolerates questionable power really well from cheap power supplies and low spec VRMs. The onboard video turns out to be pretty good if you have fast dual channel ram and your mainboard memory bandwidth is good. Not having dual channel RAM really hurts the Vega 8 on this chip.For single thread applications, a boosted 3200G comes very close to a stock Ryzen 5 3600, but if you clock up the Ryzen 5 just a little bit, it will blow this 3200G out of the water. Don't buy this CPU to be your only PC, unless you really have to scrape the low end of cost, or you must fit a case that cannot accommodate a graphics card. I recommend spending just a little more and going with a Ryzen 5.

  This cpu cooler was different than my phenom ii x6 cpu i had after installing all new mobo, ram and hd I booted up and installed windows 10.  Boy I had issues.  Kept getting clock watchdog error every time I started a youtube vid but could play State of decay 2 for 2 hours straight with no issues. I reinstalled all hardware and power pins and same prob.  Come to find out after hours of frustration and driver, hardware and windows 10 updates it was finally as stable as a rock.  Played cod warfare with no lag unlike my older cpu and somehow able to play state of decay 2 on ultra,  I have no idea what caused such great gains but this cpu and 16GB ram probably did it.

  Bought for a budget WFH build and I couldn't be happier, I didn't want to deal with a separate CPU & GPU so this was my choice. This replaced a build with a10 year old 2 core Athlon CPU and the difference is night and day. Mainly used for word processing, PowerPoints and internet browsing with many tabs/windows open and it's worked great for my needs this far. Paired this with a B450 motherboard and I'm happy with the results. I can't speak for the gaming performance of this CPU (plenty of YouTube videos for that) but regardless, AMDs adrenaline software will ensure you have the latest drivers and if you want to squeeze some more performance out of it for your needs (without dealing with a bios) you can download AMD Ryzen Master.

Decent overclock for an apu
","

  Bought this back in May as just a base chip to get a desktop started. I'm still continuing to add to my system, and having an APU just to get going was the big selling point.After some time and research I was able to overclock the CPU to 4.2 GHz all cores stable and I was able to overclock the graphics processor to 1800mhz. Having the ability to overclock the GPU side of the processor was a bonus, I seen a 300 point increase on cinebench 20 (scored 1407) after tweaking my settings.If you want to build a serious gaming rig, go ryzen 5 or higher without the built in graphics and get yourself a discrete graphics card. But if all your looking for is something to use for basic browsing/YouTube/nexflix then this is a great value chip for that purpose.

Great Processor for a Modest 1080p Gaming PC

  AMD is currently the better option for budget processors! Purchased this particular CPU to go into a new build with a used GPU (GTX 960) and it handles everything thrown at it perfectly. The included CPU cooler (Wraith) works great and keeps temps low, but if you will be overclocking this CPU I would of course recommend an aftermarket cooler. The included CPU fan had a bent mounting bracket but was easy to fix with pliers. I decided not to take off a star from the review because this was such an easy fix and is ultimately unrelated to the processor itself, even though it comes in the same box.

Offered to build a desktop over buying a new laptop as the savings and price to performance were much better ($400 vs. $900). Went with this CPU, M.2 SSD and 16gb DDR4 3000MHz. No dGPU needed as there is no desire for gaming. The performance from this CPU at $85 was astounding, work flow has become much smoother and everyone is satisfied.

This is great again for 720p to 10800 games at Low to Medium settings and great for emulation from NES to PS3.

However, the fan that was sent to me was used, and had used thermal grease still on the bottom of the heatsink.I'm not thrilled that I was sent a DIRTY used replacement when I paid for new, but after cleaning it off and putting new thermal grease on it, it is working fine and idles at around 34C, and under full load it reaches about 63-64C.

Crusader Kings 3, ARK, Siege, Assassin's Creed, Skyrim, FO4, GTAV, EVE, etc all run great with it. The one drawback I have to mention is that it is a bit limited, since it only has 2GB of VRAM.

Free fan comes with a slight protrusion with AMD brand logo so careful if installing in a mini itx as I was doing cause the logo went on my ram so I had to rotate it then it went on what looks like a radiator , so I just make it work that way. CPU EXCELLENT but the fan yah might have to plan for on a small itx and maybe place another on top without brand name protrusion

Awesome value at 720p!
","

  Works as advertised, if you need to save up for a discrete graphics card down the road but you need something that runs okay this can do the job. AT 720p!! which I am okay with but keep this in mind. 1080p you're probably going to see 30fps in low detail, on newer AAA games it may be worse. If 1080p is your intention from the start you may want to look at the 3400g. But you really can't complain about a sub-100$ APU as good as it is.

  Very good gaming cpu for it only having 4 cores, i havnt tried the integrated gpu but i have a RX570 gpu with it and i can say it performs well above the FX-8350 i used to have. This is my first new pc i built in 7 years and my first experience with the new Ryzen hardware, absolutely amazing and some good strong 4 cores.

Linux users beware.
","

  The builtin Vega 8 graphics card is incompatible with Linux, and will either cause instabilities (lost interrupts) or outright crashes. You Will need to add a Linux compatible Nvidia card, and disable the internal card if you plan to use this with Linux. I spent weeks diagnosing this issue.

Great price, but have to pair it with a real GPU to be useful for gaming
","

  I did buy this elsewhere and while I was really hoping my first Ryzen 3000 build would be great.  I am finding that the CPU is just ok.  Without a GPU, this CPU is superior to Intel, but with a GPU, the I3-9100f is a much better deal.  Much better for gaming.  Regardless, this is a great starter to eventually upgrade.  I build computers on the side and this is actually my first AMD build in about 4 years.

  I am using this CPU right now.If you want value and only do basic online computing.Look no further.It works plenty fast with the Gigabyte B450 AORUS M.Plus 16 GB Ram. I use the video from the CPU.

a great budget friendly cpu
","

  I didn't buy this cpu here cause i found it cheaper at another place but it's a great cpu for the money i'm playing triple a games on it and it works great games like battlefield 3 and 4 which are pretty graphic intense games to me anyways so i'm happy with it. sorry amazon I found the cpu cheaper somewhere else but i had to stick to a strict budget for my build

Works ok once you get all the software just right
","

  In the early days of AMD I was a fan and built lots of AMD based computers.  Then the quality of their CPUs seemed to go south with bugs and compatibility problems so I went Intel all the way.  Then the Ryzen processors came out and I heard all sorts of good things, so when my mom's computer needed rebuilding I decided to try doing the build with a Ryzen.  The regret started almost immediately.  Windows 10 crashed on install, then with a BIOS update it installed but wouldn't update.  Figuring out all the compatibility issues with Windows 10 resulted in long hours and bloodshot eyes but I finally figured out the magical combination of drivers and bios to get it to function correctly.  But what a huge pain and waste of time!  While I did get this to work in the end, I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone, there is no excuse for something so basic to be that complicated in the 21st century.  Suffice to say I am going back to Intel.

Entry into the greatest CPU family ever created.
","

  I've built about 5 Ryzen PCs this year. I used this on a PC I built for a client on a b450m board. No complaints yet! Just don't forget to overclock your RAM, I think this one supports up to 2933Mhz DDR4.With all the latest drivers installed, this PC survived a few hours of benchmarking and stress testing. I'm very pleased with the performance per dollar and I don't think it can be beat yet.

Most value and performance for entry gaming with out a dedicated GPU
","

  If you are looking to get into entry gaming and on a budget this is the best performance to cost for an APU. You get 4 cores with 4 threads at a base clock of 3.6 Hz, an unlocked processor with Radeon graphics Vega 8; saving you the initial cost of a dedicated gaming card. If paired with a good motherboard you can easily upgrade to a higher end AMD Ryzen CPU and then add a dedicated graphics card later down the road.

You are not buying this as your first choice
","

  Honestly with the Human Malware we have right now the market is really wacky with pricing and availability but this is a great choice for a processor if you are looking to build a gaming system on the cheap, if you can try getting the 3300X since the hyperthreading comes in very handy when multitasking but so far the 4 cores and 4 threads of this processor are doing all the work I need them to do.If you have less budget and you are not getting a dedicated GPU you should get the 3400G the extra Vega cores are handy and when you get a GPU in the future, again hyperthreading will come in handy.

Fast without graphics card needed
","

  Works well enough for a user like me. Ryzen 3 generation but it’s more than capable of gaming. I’m a casual gamer and I use it for work also. Has 4 cores which is an upgrade for me. Intel wouldn’t be able to beat this performance and even their price point. If you’re afraid of your cpu/apu getting too hot, it comes with a cooler fan.The main reason I got this is that it has integrated graphics so you don’t need to spend extra on a graphics card for your computer to work. The integrated graphics is more than enough that you’ll need. AMD beats Intel out of the park.

This is amazing for a apu
","

  I was benching this and It get about gt 1030 level of performance without over clocking the ram.If you know what your doing you could easily run most modern AAA's at 720p low settingsIt's not a bad option, and you could just install a graphics card in a year or two when games get more demanding.for a under 300 dollar budget this would be my option.

Great CPU to Use for Casual and Gaming
","

  I have no problems with this CPU at all. It sits in a MSi Gaming Pro MAX . It installed nice and works great and cools perfectly with the stock cooler. No mater what I do it hangs around 37c - 98f . I chose this CPU because the build it  went into is only  for surfing and streaming video and it keep my upgrade cost were I wanted it.

Decent speed for a system not needing high performance.

  For a few bucks more than the 2300G you get an unlocked processor that scores quite a bit higher in performance benchmarks.
