Just died 237 days after purchase.
","

  I've been plagued with Windows 10 blue screen errors that grew in frequency over the last couple of weeks. It's almost always ""WHEA UNCORRECTABLE ERROR"". Now I cannot even boot into Windows without almost immediately getting a blue screen. I've tried new RAM, so that is ruled out. I tried a new SSD, no dice. I took out my GPU and ran from on-board graphics, no dice.I unplugged everything required for the PC to run. I didn't even have a HDD or SSD installed. I popped in my Windows 10 USB installer, annnnnd blue screen. WHEA UNCORRECTABLE ERROR. I swapped in a friend's CPU to test my motherboard and make absolutely certain there was nothing wrong with it, and everything booted up and worked flawlessly.We put the CPU into his motherboard, blue screen. WHEA UNCORRECTABLE ERROR.  The CPU is completely dead. It was never overclocked (it obviously can't be since it's non-K). It was definitely properly cooled for all 237 days that it was installed. It was never overheated or even used for gaming. At worst it was used for a design software that recommends a 3rd gen quad core.This is a well taken care of machine, and the CPU completely gave up on me for no reason at all.

I like it so far!
","

  At first I was thinking of getting the overclockable version, but coming from a potato laptop with a 4th gen i7 processor, I was okay with getting this version i5-8400, I like it, it's snappy fast, all works good so far, and i'm happy to say that, because I've never built a PC before and I just did 2 days ago by watching youtube tutorials lol, but I realized that if I wanted the i5-8600k I needed to  get a more expensive motherboard, so I ended up saving lots of money to invest in the GPU and other peripherals.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE 2/25/2019 :After about a month of using my PC with this processor, I haven't had any issues with it! installed Extreme utility Tool for intel to verify the temps of the processor, Playing fornite after 1 - 3 hours, it has not exceeded more than 57 Degrees, so it was always pretty cool, I'm using the CPU cooler Deepcool Gammaxx 400 white LED.  CPU usage never exceeded 75% I believe also while playing/rendering, used this processor with the Asus dual GTX 1060 6GB + 16GB 2400mhz Ram.For an 8 minute video in 1080p 60fps format, it took about 10-20 minutes of rendering ( of course load is both on the CPU and GPU during this process) , paired with the board : B360M DS3H + SSD Adata 240GB, the PC boots in 13-16 seconds from the moment I press the power on button on my computer. I am happy I went with this processor instead of the i3-8100 ( which I was thinking of at first ) but my friend suggested an i5 of the 8th gen at least for basic future proofing .( BTW ) my YT channel is : Zealous Pumpkin check me out ! I do meme edits and funny videos about fortnite lol!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 4/17/2019:3 months in using this beautiful underrated CPU! This thing is really nice , For any interested gamer ,Fortnite 1080p Maxed out an i5-8400 CPU + GTX 1060 6GB will play from 60-90fps , I cap my fps to 120 with my custom settings and with unlimited fps, it can reach 200fps+ sometimes and minimum 120. this processor with the right cooler, has never gone over 60C for me , and I live in quite a hot country btw. got this for 179.99$ before black friday and have never seen it go lower than that ( Just once on May-August 2018) for the same price but never again , so it was a great deal.

LOVE the provided fan mount!
","

  I recently moved from AMD to Intel and love that I did.  I went with a Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Ultra motherboard, the fan mounts are great, they just snap in place (not like the lever I had to use my AMD fans).  I elected to use a water color I bought for my AMD, the upHere Technology all-in-one 120 mm PWM fan and works just fine.  Although the cooler lists it doesn't work with 1151, it fits just fine (look online for installation).I primarily upgraded to be able to support World of Warcraft (WoW) battle grounds (BGs), especially the epic ones with 2 x 40 people in them.  The chip was defaulted to 2.8 gHz, before doing any dabbling on overclocking....I tested it out in the BGs.  Worked great, even when in close proximity of 50 people (no lag).  My AMD was at 3.6 gHz (using 32 gb of ram) and this runs better even though I am only using 2 x 4 gb ram strips on my intel setup.

Perfect for 1080p gaming and likely 1440p.

  Pros:- Easy to install (no overclocking and stock cooler is enough in most scenarios)- 6 Cores.- Benches extremely well relative to other CPUs and other i5-8400s ( I hear some pass quality control with issues that still allow it to function but significantly limits its power).- Low heat and power consumption- Capable Internal GPU.Cons:- A little pricy for a locked processor.- No hyperthreading.I recently got a 240 hz monitor and this processor can maintain 200+ fps for most the games I play (League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Overwatch) while having twitch open. I only have an old rx 580 so its likely the bottleneck.Previously I had a 120hz 1080p monitor and with uncapped framerate it can push up to 360 fps in League of Legends with the onboard UHD 630 graphics card.

  I have no problems with the CPU I’ve had for almost a month now it’s definitely budget friendly, it helped me on my motherboard that supports a LGA1151 socket I’m glad it could come with a stock cooler fan too. If you’re new to PC building this is ideally a good CPU for your setup it’s very underrated and I don’t see in the near future trying to replace this chip.

  Clearly marked as a 2.8 GHZ processor. However, in the description of the item it stated it as a 4.0 GHZ. They have since changed the headline to say ""up to 4.0 GHZ"".

  Quality CPU. Probably the best value for a solid budget gaming build in 2018. If you are intending on playing any new large open world games in higher resolutions I would recommend the 8700k, but for medi-high settings at around 40-50 fps on such games in 1080p, this CPU works excellently.  Also pretty decent for HD video editing/rendering.

  Best choice for an economical, plug and play gaming build. Rivals processors costing twice the price when it comes to gaming performance (check youtube). No need to fuss around with tweaking settings, installing overpriced high-speed RAM, premium motherboards, or expensive, bulky cooling solutions. Spend the money you'll save on a better graphics card, or just send it to me. Worried about the future? Then go ahead and pair it with a decent Z370 motherboard which has overclocking features. Then you could always sell this chip and drop in a k-series processor later, if you decide you want to mess around with overclocking.

Intel 8400 CPU is a great gaming CPU
","

  After watching several YouTube videos and recommendations I decided to go with the Intel I5 8400 CPU. I am not interested in overclocking my CPU/RAM so did not consider the I5-8600K. The 8400 has 6 cores, and there is a turbo mode built into the processor that safely increases the frequency when needed AND DOESN'T VOID the Intel warranty. Also, 65 watts of power consumption so the CPU will run cooler not requiring liquid cooling. There have been some negative comments about the default fan - again back to YouTube videos showing it does adequately cool the CPU (by the way, the CPU is running 86 degrees right now)! The fan is very quite compared to my previous FX-6300 gaming platform. I paired the I5-8400 with the Gigabyte Z370 HD3P ATX motherboard and 8GB of 2666 ddr4 memory. CINEBENCH NUMBERS DOUBLED over the FX-6300 system that I have been using this past 3 years! Relatively easy installation and system booted right up and has been running fine for several days. Higher fps (60+) on all games so far (1080p monitor) and rich, detailed colors and great sound!

Best Bang for Your Buck!!!

  This is by far the best bang for your buck when it comes to processors. The i5 8400 also runs extremely cool. I have this in a very small and compact case with only the stock fan/heatsink. Under load, it runs no higher than 65 degrees C. When idling it sits at about 40 degrees C. The stock fans are quiet for the most part whether idling or under load. The only downside of the 8400 is that it doesn't have the ability to overclock. However, I have not gotten to the point where I need to. Right now this a beast for gaming along with my GTX 1080.

Very good value per core and a good, future-proof choice for gamers and majority of users.
","Intel BX80684I58400 8th Gen Core i5-8400 Processor

   Please note that my mini-review is based on the limited in store testing, I am still waiting for my CPU to arrive so I can confirm the findings.To sum up, i5-8400 is currently the most affordable way to get a six core Intel build. It works out at $30 per core, which is even less than a cost per core of previous generation Kaby Lake CPUs.The downsides are - the multiplier overclocking is disabled and the base clock is pretty low, the TDP is limited to 65W.In practice what this means is a lot of benchmarks that can take advantage of 6 cores will look better than a 4-core CPU, but in single threaded tasks or some games, faster clocked cores can still give better responsiveness.The i5 8400 offers more than good enough performance for most tasks and uses very little power in idle and is still limited to around 65Watts under load. In my view this makes it a very good CPU choice for a main productivity/gaming machine that is powered on 24/7 or most of the day.The 6 cores future-proof the computer in case one suddenly wants to try their talents and a video game streamer or something similar.Paired with 370 chipset it also opens up a possibility of an upgrade, if someone really finds this CPU to be too limiting.Overall, I find this particular CPU to be of very good value currently and also offering enough performance for the majority of computing tasks - hence 5 stars.

  Decent cpu, but compared to the amd ryzen 1600 or 2600, they're going to be the cheaper and better performing option than this

better then the ryzen 1600 PTP

  for the price it has better about the same if not better then the new i7 8700k for half the price and is about the same the a ryzen1600 in gaming for the most part but cheaper so the i5 is better in the standpoint  but when it comes to rendering videos or productivity wise it falls short but that's to be expected of it for the smaller thread count the i7 8700k is better for that by a huge margin

Not worth it for price
","

  Alright so here's my honest opinion. Lacks in productivity benchmarks against ryzen 1600 and gaming performance is kinda same. You have to buy cpu cooler separately which brings it to almost same price as ryzen. Also new motherboard every launch doesn't help given you would be able to upgrade ryzen to ryzen+ and ryzen 2 without buying new mobo. If this was about 150-160 then sure, this would have been pretty nice upgrade but at current price, not really worth it.

Fake release in extremely limited production. What game is Intel playing?
","

  I've been waiting for this but alas, a rush release by Intel to trick the market and cheat the consumers. Besides, once you upgrade your motherboard along with the Coffee Lake there is no upgrade path. Next year there will be an new socket and a new Lake. Better off going with a Ryzen and having multiple upgrade options for next generation processors.

  Should have been at least more performance than ryzen 1600. Taking mobo cost the cost. Add up

Not impressed, its lame. 3rd generation on 14nm with new mobo
","

  6 core and 6 thread unlocked with very less cache memory and only 10$ cheaper than unlocked 1600x, not impressed.Power consumption((not tdp)) is same as 12 core AMD thread-ripper.Only advantage is clock speed. better to buy cheap unlocked i3 if you want to 5.0ghz processor :xD3rd generation on 14nm with new MB, and coming with 12nm with 2nd gen ryzen.Canon lake will be 10nm which will require new MB again.

Love the i5

  Having an Emachine since 2006 I decided to build my own computer and had been using a duel processor. I bought a new motherboard and ram and the i5 I was amazed at how fast it was.
