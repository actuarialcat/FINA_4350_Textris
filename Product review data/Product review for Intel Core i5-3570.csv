  I'm not sure if this cpu is better than my old i5-3330. The percent of cpu utilization seems to go up a lot faster than the old cpu while performing similar tasks; but the motherboard that I'm using this cpu in is missing 2-3 socket prongs. I don't know if that would have anything to do with it. All 4 core temps fluctuate independently in hw monitor, so I'd assume that all cores are functional. It doesn't really matter, as I only use this pc for light stuff like browsing at this point, which generally only uses around 10% or less processing power. (I also haven't tested it since removing the antivirus software that was conspiring with windows to use 100% hdd read/write for up to 10 minutes after booting the pc. Even without the antivirus, windows uses 100% disc speed for up to two, maybe three minutes after boot, so I only ever hibernate my pc now. I know it's not the disc because I just replaced the 7 y/o WD Blue hdd with brand new WD Black hdd and it still does the same. Just microsoft being microsoft I guess. I mention it because if windows is wasting my hdd resources, it could also be wasting my cpu resources. win 8.1 home, btw, modded with classic shell so I don't have to look at or interact with the metro ui).

Worth the Buy for the Budget-Minded
","

  I bought this processor around Christmas and I've had it through the paces now.  I'm not going to get into technical stuff as other people have thankfully already put in their word on that.  What I will say is that this processor has tremendous bang for the buck and the price point is right.After researching my options for a couple weeks ($300 is a big deal to me), I came to the conclusion that this unit was the right price with the right amount of firepower.  I almost stepped it up to an i7 because I do some video editing, but I can still render out a 1080p 15 minute clip with some post work in about 35-40 minutes in Premiere (16 gig ram).For the money, I'm completely satisfied with it.

  I know it's silly to review at this point since Haswell came out, but this little processor is just amazing. Under load, its heatsink keeps it at around 55-60C - no need for extra cooling! The included graphics are good, honestly, they'll do for troubleshooting if the graphics card ever fails. Worked out of the box of course, zero issues with installation.

One of my best buys

  I upgraded from Pentium G620 and the difference is H-U-G-E ! 4 cores @ 3400 Mhz with a sweet overclocked gtx 660 gpu and my custom-built PC is just the gaming machine I needed. Definitely recommended for those who don't want to do overclocking and experimenting. Cheaper than the K version, newer model, and their only difference is that the K has better integrated graphics and is able to overclock. Also this cpu has some extra features the K version doesn't. And btw integrated graphics suck anyway.P.S: For those of you who chose to upgrade to this cpu and are using windows 7 , make sure after the installation, that your cpu is running on 4 cores. Sometimes the system can't read more than 1 core if the previous cpu was 1 core. Google for more information ;) hope i helped !

Great performance for the money
","

  All I can say is WOW.  This is actually a bit of a downgrade from my previous i7-970, but I rarely needed the extra cores/hyperthreading so I figured putting some cash towards the other components would be better suited.So far this CPU has exceeded my expectations.  Since this machine is primarily used for web surfing, gaming, and photo editing, this CPU simply runs circles around anything I throw at it.  I've yet to see it struggle, even when doing my initial burn-in testing.  Oh, and turbo boost is more like overclocking.  I've seen this CPU peg itself at 3.8GHz (max turbo speed) for as long as I have whatever stressing it running.One night I felt a little crazy and decided to simply bump up the turbo speeds, basically setting everything up 200MHz.  I now see it frequently hit (and remain at) 4GHz and still as stable as can be.  Temps are fine under load, I'm sure I could push it more if I felt so inclined!  Now I do have a Cooler Master Hyper 212 on here.  I wouldn't push this CPU beyond normal speeds without some kind of aftermarket cooler.  Even without overclocking, it wouldn't be a bad idea to replace that tiny cooler it comes with.  It's barely adequate for stock speeds.Besides being unlocked, the only feature the ""K"" processor has over the standard is better on-chip graphics.  For me, I went straight for the locked unit as I didn't plan on overclocking and I knew I'd be using dedicated graphics.  Of course shortly after getting the 3570, I find the 3570K is only $1 more than this processor.  It seems the gap widened again, but still annoying.  Never the less, unless you need onboard video or plan on some pretty substantial overclocking (more than simply changing the multiplier), this is plenty of power for you!

  I upgraded all of my components from a much slower system, so it's difficult to ascertain how much of my speed gains are from the processor, but there's no doubt this is a fast processor. Some anecdotal observations from playing a couple 2-3 year old games on my new system but before I upgraded my Nvidia 8800GT video card indicated that the games ran much faster for what it's worth. Since I'm not overclocking, I went with the stock heat sink and fan.  I'd heard the fan can be quite loud, but I don't feel that it's very noticeable at all except when first booting up the computer.

Fastest HTPC ever

  I know that many people will find it a bit odd to use the 3570 for the heart of the HTPC I built, but it works. The processor is powerful enough to handle anything thrown at it without an overclock, and the Intel HD 2500 integrated graphics can handle a blu-ray playback without a discrete GPU. No lag, no fuss, no problems. The low profile CPU cooler works, and unlike the horrid AMD coolers, it's nearly silent most of the time.One thing many people skimp on with an HTPC is the processor. But I'd rather have something that will have the power needed to last 4-5 years compared to some crappy dual core that saved them $70 now, but cost them an entirely new build in 2 years.

Amazing performance

  Update: It's been 1 month and a half, the processor is performing FLAWLESSLY, temps were still a a little high when playing (70C on the cores, 80 when doing the Aida64 stress test to the CPU and FPU) but i finally decided to change the stock cooler for a Cooler Master hyper 212+ and now, temps don't even get to 55C when playing Battlefield 3, GTA IV, Assassin's creed Revelations, emulating PS2 or Gamecube. Also, they don't pass 60C when doing the Aida64 stress test. Now i can finally get peace of mind knowing that temps won't suddenly skyrocket because the stock cooler couldn't take it anymore.All i can say is i'm really, really impressed with this processor. I was obviously going to see a MAJOR improvement over my old 1st gen core i3, but was a little skeptic on wether it would be enought for my needs.I bought this processor mainly for gaming and emulation purposes. I have to say it, this processor is a BEAST. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on PCSX2 was very slow when i played it with my Core i3, but with this processor it goes as smooth as it can be (some slowdowns in some parts, but that's because of the emulator, not the processor's fault), I've seen improvements on games like Assassin's creed 2 (40fps tops before with my HD 6870 and some settings set to medium-low, 60 fps constant now with the new i5, same graphics card and all settings on max.), Battlefield 3, Minecraft (kind of a processor hog), Sims 3, Prototype 1 & 2, etc. Pretty much every game.Temps are a little high on the cores when under load with stock cooler: 70C when gaming and 80C when doing a stress test with Aida64 (Don't wanna try Prime95 or intel burn test with stock cooler). But i' just waiting for my mx-4 thermal paste to arrive so i can go buy a cooler master v8 cooler to do the job. I expecto temps to go as high as 50-60C under load with that.For normal use, it works just as well, no slowdowns, everythings goes smooth.To make it short, i definitely recommend this processor if you don't plan on overcloking, like me.

I Never Knew What I Was Missing
","

  I've been using computers for nearly 30 years and have built about 100. I'm sorry guys, I mean, I don't think I'm a big shot, but I've never purchased an i5 before, until recently I've always used the top or close to it, Intel processor, Xeon's or i7's these days. But a few weeks back I assembled an i3 NUC and for normal computer work it's just fine. The other two computers I'm on a lot are an upgraded Dell i7 4770 and a custom built dual Xeon workstation.I do a lot of computer upgrades so I'm looking at new power supplies and RAM and video cards from upgrades all around my garage and none of it being used. So I figure if I've got to store them somewhere....So inspired by the NUC I get a Rosewill mini tower and a card reader with USB 3 ports, an Asus board, an Intel SSD and some accessories. Digging through my leftovers I found 16 GB of 1600 MHz ram and a 460 watt p/s and a GTX 650 card and with the i5 I've got a system worthy of today's standards.It's no surprise that this little system is capable, after using the i3 NUC. After 25 years of building and lot's of hot rodding I think overclocking is in my past. Drives were always the problem and SSD's are the fix, so building a new 18 month old computer is a fine way to store old parts and with USB 3 externals I don't even need a second drive, although I should put one in, it is storage after all, I'll put in two. This processor will do some serious work quickly, unlike the i3, I can hardly notice the difference from the i7 4770. Researching the matter, the performance of this 3.4 GHz i5 didn't change much from the 2nd, 3rd to 4th generation, the new Haswell isn't 10% faster. With Windows power options set to High Performance it runs at 3.6 and boosts to almost 3.9GHz. But what's important is that the processor is only one of many things that make a computer fast and your information can't be processed any faster than your drive can read or write it and more RAM won't help if your program doesn't use it and accesses the drive, so use a SSD. With the stock cooler I've yet to see over 38 degrees, so try it before spending money on an upgrade.This system isn't as small as the NUC (what is?)  but it's small and I've kept it quiet by turning down the speed of its 2 case fans and it's another hard working machine for $550. Those considering Shuttle's for HTPC or mini servers should take a look. So what was I missing? At least $150 on every other processor I purchased.

  Was terrified I would break it somehow, or it wouldn't work for some reason, but it worked perfectly.  Didn't have any issues, the instructions were pretty clear and simple.

  It is doing ever thing i want and more. It says it only goes to 3.4 GHz but it really can go to 3.6 on a good day.

","

  It was worth every penny for me, coming from a dual core processor I knew this would be a relatively big upgrade but it most definitely exceeded my expectations. I purchased this in preparation for the game 'FarCry4' and the processor purrs like a kitten. In general, all my games load and run faster.

  Most people suggest going for the 3570k if you want the best gaming performance, but in all reality all you need is the 3570 because it give you enough Juice at 3.4Ghz so you can render everygame in HD! It runs DayZ, BO2, BF3, and Crysis 3 maginificatly along with my Sapphire Radeon HD 7770!

  Runs perfectly.  This replaced a i3 for doing photo processing.  I thought there would be more of a bump in performance but not really that noticeable.

Intel Core I-5 3570 CPU
","

  I assembled a computer with this CPU back in  2012.  It has worked flawlessly.  Initially I had 8 GB of RAM and a regular hard drive.  The only changes I have made to the computer is to upgrade to 16 GB of RAM and install an SSD.  I keep thinking about assembling a new computer with the latest hardware, but my current rig is fast and stable.  I do not game, so I will just keep using the current computer until I think it is not keeping up.  It is looking like that won't be for quite a few years.

Keeps on giving
","

  This venerable Ivy Bridge CPU continues to be a beast for the budget minded, not least because of DDR3 memory prices. Standard desktop applications have no problem even with the built-in graphics. With the right graphics card it's still fit for modern gaming--LoL will yield over 160fps. I had to replace a unit in August 2019 so I checked out the upgrade possibilities and in the end bought another 3570 machine from a surplus store.

Great value. Does Everything Well.
","

  It rocks ""Second Life"" and Google Earth, Video Editing etc. AND you don't have to worry about leaving your email open or browser tabs, etc.  I was a little surprised that Second Life almost pegs one of the cores on a steady basis, but it seems to work ok. I am thinking that there might be some glitch in the viewer, since my Pentium G640 started to peg earlier, which is why I upgraded. Otherwise it tears through anything I sick it on. The one MAJOR issue I had was not the fault of the CPU, but an obscure setting in my HP P6-2220t, which came with a dual core cpu (Pent.G640) It only allowed 2 cores to function. ""Task Manager"" only saw 2. ""Speccy"" only saw 2, Etc. I thought I had a dud and was attempting to return it when I learned something;  There is a setting that limits the machine to 2 cores. It is located in Run/Msconfig/boot/advanced options. MAKE sure that the little box ""number of processors"" is NOT CHECKED!!!!!  If it is, then uncheck it and reboot. Then you will be using all 4 cores !  -BA

Intel Core i5-3570: Great CPU
","

  great performance for the money (especially if purchased used ). Slightly faster than the far more common i5-3470. Must run a few degrees cooler than other similar processors which came before (e.g. i5-2400) or after (e.g. i5-4570). Features some of the newer instructions. Suitable for computational intensive tasks (simulations, rendering, etc.) and can run most games on medium settings with a good video card (and yes, it is overkill for general desktop duty). Supports hardware virtualization (i.e. it can run 64bit virtual operating systems, e.g. in Oracle VirtualBox). So far so good, 5-star.

This is good for all except a few new games.

  This has done really well over the past 6 years. It's just not quite enough for a few of the new games of 2018. I have been completely satisfied with it for the entire time I've had it.

  I built a new gaming PC with this CPU and let me tell you, this blew my old i5-2500k away. Everything runs faster. Battlefield 3 is smooth and I can even multitask well for work. I'm very happy with this CPU. Good for you Intel.

Avoid if you are using onboard graphics!
","

  If you intend to use the onboard graphics with this CPU, then RUN, don't walk, away from all Ivy Bridge. Had my monitor hooked up using DVI-D. After install of Windows, my monitor would display the boot screen and Windows logo, but then...nada. Display would only work if booted into safe mode (using Microsoft VGA driver). After searching online using another computer, found that this has been a known issue with Intel hardware/drivers for almost 2 years, and they still haven't fixed it. The only way to get the display to run was to hook up the monitor using a VGA cable (evidently, the Intel driver decides that the VGA port is the only usable one, and doesn't output to DVI-D, even if there is a monitor attached.I bought this CPU specifically because it had built-in graphics, because I didn't want to have to buy a separate graphics card for a non-gaming PC. But in order to use DVI-D, I'm going to have to buy a separate card.
