RIP Intel
","

  One of of the best and affordable processors money can buy. Can do everything including cad modeling/rendering, 4k/8k editing, gaming, streaming, virtual machines. Worth it if you do video editing or 3D modeling or just love awesome tech. Way better deal than any intel i9.The chip needs to be set and screwed down in the TR4 socket properly. If not it wont read all the memory modules and can cause all kinds of issues. This chip likes low latency C14 memory for the infinity fabric. It is not cheap but it is highly recommended. The memory will read at a much lower speed when you first put them in your motherboard but highend memory should overclock to 3200mhz which makes the system run significantly faster.Get familiar with the ryzen master software it has a lot of settings and a couple different performance configurations like creator or game mode. It will also give you the true temperature readings since many mobos and programs are reading the Threadripper temps incorrectly. If anyone has any issues with installation or configurations send me a message.

Amazing CPU but DO YOUR RESEARCH
","

  I love that Enterprise level hardware is now available to the masses at insane prices ($850 vs $1,800 for i9-7960X) but this also presents a problem with people wanting ""the best"" without properly configuring their PC which leads to a bad experience.  Here's a short list of recommendations:1. Make sure your motherboard has the most recent BIOS updates. Especially if they're a Generation One Threadripper board. Although it is compatible with Gen 2 Ryzen, it may not work without a BIOS update beforehand.2. Make sure your RAM is at least CL 14 - CL 16 with 3200 Mhz DDR4 Ram Quad Channel RAM. Threadripper's Infinity Fabric is EXTREMELY memory hungry and without fast ram, the latency can cause bottlenecking issues under heavy rendering loads. You may have to update your BIOS in order to see your RAM hit anywhere near 3200 Mhz, as mine were pinned at 2400Mhz until I did an update that allowed me to hit higher frequencies.3. GET A PROPER COOLER. A lot of companies are lying about their support for the TR4 platform but really only cover about 75% of the CPU. As of now, only the Cooler Master Wraith Ripper and Enermax TR4 can get the job done properly. I opted for the Enermax (1st gen was trash but 2nd gen seems to me holding up) and I'm seeing temps of 55 - 60 under full load.At the end of the day, yes you'll be able to run Fortnight in 5 different instances while streaming in 1440P BUT I hope anyone who's thinking about getting this type of system to start investing in learning CAD, Adobe Premier, ETC. You now have a machine that is designed with work in mind and it would be a shame to not maximize your return from an investment in hardware like this.

Lives up to the hype, in the right circumstances
","

  I am more than satisfied with my TR2950X, but it is not the right processor for everyone.I purchased this processor for 4K+ video editing and color grading, and it delivers without breaking a sweat. I am able to playback 4K, 5K, and most 6K RED footage at Full Res/Premium quality in real time via DaVinci Resolve. In fact, I can play back two streams of 4K/23.98 RED footage in real time, allowing for dissolves and compositing without having to cache/render. It also crushes video encoding and transcoding tasks. This CPU completely demolishes my Xeon based systems, for significantly less money.That said, if you are not pushing this processor to its full potential, it may actually be slower than a more mainstream model. For example, when working in HD, my Avid Symphony systems based on older i7-7700K processors actually outperform this CPU due to higher clock speeds. Also, Threadrippers are harder to cool than more mainstream processors, which can lead to throttling and slower performance, if not planned for accordingly.So, before hopping on the hype train, make sure you have a plan to use the raw power that this processor is capable of, and not let most of it sit idle. However, if you have high level computing tasks, or do a ton of multitasking, then this processor is a fantastic choice.

Great power at a great price!
","

  The 2950x is a great CPU at a much better value than the 1950x. The only complaint is that it’s not “easy” to get it to boost to the 4.4ghz advertised single core boost clock in some cases. All in all though, this chip is fast enough, very powerful, and much less power hungry than the previous generation. It performs especially well in both workstation workloads, and gaming applications where you’re gaming, and streaming from a single machine.Further Nerd stuff regarding 4.4ghz boost clock:You will need a good motherboard with a really strong VRM. While the gen 1 TR motherboards will work, it’s better to use some of the x399 boards that were released specifically for the ThreadRipper 2000 series CPUs. In the “overclocking” software Ryzen Master there are 3 factors which the system uses to determine how high to boost the chip. These are all related to how much power the CPU can get. EDC specifically is related to how many amps the motherboard can provide to the chip, and is more often than not the limiting factor. Without a really good motherboard you’ll have to optimize power distribution to things like your memory, and power settings to allow the board to underclock other cores to get it to hit the 4.4ghz single core.

Great CPU, with air cooling!

  My ages old (2007) PC finally died (motherboard). I needed a new PC. The research began. I am an old retired science guy. The only games I play are solitaires. I wanted a machine that could handle multi-threaded programs. The 2950X seemed like a good choice, but everybody was ranting about the necessity of liquid coolers. I have seen what leaking liquid coolers can do.I took a leap and ordered the 2950X, the ASRock X399 gaming MB, 64GB DDR4 ram, 2TB PCIe NVMe boot drive, 750W power supply,  RX 580 8G graphics, Fractal R6 case and the Noctua 140mm air cooler.When I first assembled the PC, the CPU ran warm at full load. I ordered the second fan for the cooler and added 2 Noctua fans to the case (bottom) as well as replacing all the Fractal fans. After tweeking the UEFI fan profiles, the unit ran quiet and peaked at 56DegC (Ryzen Master) running both CPU and Graphics full on for an hour. I'm very satisfied with the outcome. The machine is rock stable and quiet. I have no complaints about any of the component parts. Highly recommend.

The Threadripper 2950x a gem and a stubborn install.
","

  This thing is a beast, but its socket isn't the standard push down and your done. At least that's all the personal cpu chips I've had have been. This one it particular has these hex key orange tool that you have to screw in a certain order to get it to seat properly. You have to start it evenly then proceed in order until the top of the screw driver clicks. I followed this and still had to re-seat the thing. Which involved a nervous bread-boarding of my motherboard and connecting things bit by bit as i wasn't sure if the thing was dead. Its working fine now but that process was very stressful as I thought i was going to have to RMA it. That being said the processor works great and render well for stock settings, and you can tune it to work even better with some simple bios tweaks depending on your board. Id still recommend the CPU for the power but be prepare to sweat a bit if this is your first 16+ core computer install. Oh and my board had a foxcon socket type I'm not sure if that matters but I heard the other version is nicer from other reviews. Im running the thermaltake AIO cooler 360mm, as the Threadripper comes with a AIO cooler adapter in the box which widens your choices of cooler.

WOW!!! All I can say is WOW

  I'm not sure why this CPU is dropping in price and playing second fiddle to the new Ryzen 3700's because this thing is a MONSTER.  The only issues I have are that some of my programs are not multi-core designed so in my older version of After Effects, it's like I'm running a Celeron or something.  But that's not this CPU's fault.  It's has way more power than what you need for gaming.  But I use it for video editing.When I started editing videos back in the Pentium 4 days, it would take 2-4 X's the length of the video to encode an SD video to a DVD.  So a 1 hour video would take between 2-4 hours.  This CPU takes a 1 hour SD video and spits it out in the same DVD format in a little over 5 minutes (CPU usage is usually only 60% during this process).  My 2011 Quad Core W/ HT i7 will take 30 minutes for the same process. I know that is an extreme example, but it is consistent (an old P4 will never have messed with HD or 4K, so we're keeping things consistent).  And since the CPU is only using 60% while it's encoding, I no longer have to leave the computer overnight to do its thing.  Rather, I can put one video on encode and then pull up another one and do some editing and it doesn't slow things down AT ALL!!!  I'm telling you, if you do heaving multitasking and video editing, you NEED this CPU.  For the $$$, it is the BEST performance you will find.  Obviously don't sink this thing with dumb crap like too little RAM or with anything less than an NVMe drive.  And make sure you use a proper GPU.  And BTW, I have not O/C'd this chip.  It's totally stock with a Noctua fan on it.  This fan is the best option as others have tested water on it and it doesn't seem to be right for this chip.  Find the Noctua cooler/fan combo that fits this chip.  It has a large enough base for the girth this chip brings to your bed.

Not as great as expected
","

  I did not buy this for gaming, I bought it for video editing and 3D animation.  So I can't speak to its gaming performance.  Then again, it isn't really made for gaming.I'm not sure if my expectation for this CPU was simply unrealistic, or if it just doesn't live up to the hype.  I will say that I went from using a very old Pentium 4 based editing rig to a fully-decked-out rid driven by this CPU, and running processes that strictly rely on CPU speed (namely 3D animation rendering), the gains in speed are surprisingly small.I have not yet tried to overclock the CPU.  I didn't figure I would have to, in order to see huge speed gains compared to my decade-old former CPU.  So anyway, take this for what it is worth since I am not the most expert regarding hardware specs.  I expected my mind to be blown, but instead I can say it's a little bit faster than a Pentium 4.  I just wanted more from over ten years of hardware evolution.

  Good part: with 16 cores and NUMA mode enabled, you can create contents very efficiently while the gaming experience is not dropping a lot compared to game mode.cons: Windows and applications are not optimized enough, so sometimes apps only use 8 cores if NUMA enabled.

  Go AMD, GO!  This chip is a a monster.  I was not an AMD fan before I bought this chip and this is my first AMD chip.  What else can I say, I am floored.  I plan never to buy another Intel product again as long as I live, well, unless they bring their prices in line with the competition which they will be forced to do if they want to compete.My installation was not entirely stress free.  My first motherboard had a socket that I could not close.  Then the cooler that I bought was not compatible with Threadripper.  I had to update the bios to get the motherboard to recognize my four sticks of RAM.  But other than that, other issues were minor.  I did get 4 channel RAM to take advantage of the 4 channel memory bandwidth.  And I also took advantage of the free RAID 0 nvme setup for 2x nvme speeds.  This is the first computer that I build, I was hesitant to build one before since it seemed daunting, but everything went smoothly.  If you are reading this and you are unsure you want to build your own computer, buying the parts from Amazon certainly helps since they have a generous return policy.  It is not as challenging as most people think, I am a convert and am never going to purchase a pre-built PC again.

Great upgrade from the 1950X

  The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X Processor (YD295XA8AFWOF) was a replacement for a 1950X that had suffered several over-temperature events due to a bad Enermax liquid CPU cooler (failed after 1yr 1mo since purchase). When I tried to find a 1950x replacement CPU I found that it had been superseded by the 2950x. The speed difference was 56/1183 to 35/1183 and it is noticeable. I ran the UserBenchmark and the CPU was classified ""UFO"" for its speed in gaming, desktop and workstation.

I've built dozens of computers before for myself, family, and friends. This one is screaming fast as you would expect plus it is also very quiet thanks mostly to the CPU's Corsair liquid cooler. The PC is brand new and I haven't really pushed it's capability much yet but that will come. My only criticism would be the packing that the CPU came in.

Surpisingly good in 2020.

  I enabled PBO and observed the CPU's behavior in HW monitor with great interest. All 16 cores will boost to 4.4 GHz individually, and all together have boosted to 4.24 GHz. That was not commonly happening when this CPU was first released and reviewed, and I wonder if this one is just better, or if all the more recently built ones are better silicon overall.I noticed that under a moderate load, the temps hold at about 51 degrees, and under a heavy boost, temps go into the low 60s before the fans spool up and drive them back into the 50s. That's impressive considering I am using a round AIO cooler that doesn't even cover the entire IHS. Looking at the PBO constraints, I find that the limiting factor thus far is not temperature at all but voltage. This makes me wonder if I can undervolt and obtain the 200MHz offset for 4.6 GHz.Not that this really matters, its just a fun and interesting thing to check out. What does matter is that I came from a 1900X, and I am kind of shocked by the difference. Dota2 saw a 22% increase in FPS, and I'm not exactly sure why. Other games it made no difference. I think some games suffered from the first gen TR scheduling, though the 1900X certainly did far better in games than I expected.Interacting with gigantic folders of images in windows is completely different with double the cores. 32 threads is more than enough most of the time for me. I checked. Even with my ""leave everything up when I take a brake to game"" use case, I still found that 4 to 6 of the 32 threads weren't being used. On the other hand, when you do a batch file conversion, its pretty cool that programs use all available resources.I'm glad I was able to get one of these before they disappear. I have an enormous amount of storage with the x399 NVME setup and I don't really feel like building a new system yet. This is a nice stopgap, though I wish the 3960X was a 16 core that fit in X399.I'm not sure that anyone should get this, except if you currently have a 1900x or 1920x, or if you can find a great deal on all the hardware and absolutely need the I/O. Otherwise X570 with 3950X is the way to go.

  First and foremost I am not a child who bought a TR chip for gaming. I was using the intel X99 platform, specifically the 6900k for a couple years for work and some play after work. I have owned dozens of computers over the past decade (mostly intel up until Ryzen). I still currently own 2nd & 3rd gen Ryzen 7's as well as 6,8&9th gen intel i7's.If you have a way to use all of the TR cores in a specific work load then its perfect. But its a bit of a 1 trick pony. It is not the one size fits all package that a more seasoned intel processor will bring you on a monolith design. Im currently using a 7980XE and hands down it is the best CPU i have ever used. It not only slays in work but also plays games like a champ. All this is done with out having to go into Ryzen master and changing the settings and restarting the computer and getting back to work. The fact that this CPU came out in 2017 and is this for so long is just hands down more impressive to me. Sure people will argue that its a much more expensive chip. But That really isnt the case when its amortized over the ownership it doesnt end up being that bad. Not to mention that im  running at 4.7ghz on more than half of the cores.

  If you want to get the every last frame from a game, sorry to say this is not the CPU for you, but if you want a chip that can take anything you throw at it you have it. Gaming, live streaming, video/audio/photo editing, coding, having more than five tabs open, this will be the heart of a great system.Ryzen Master software is wonderful. It lets you see everything about the chip, from temp, peak speed and power usage. It also has the ability have different modes a creator mode, game mode (for software/games that cannot handle 16 cores), or create your own profile. This includes going in and using their boost to overclock or do it manually on your own.The only negative I have about the chip is the install. It can be daunting holding it and getting it set into the motherboard but with how it slides in goes smooth but I did screw the lid down as tight as needed (the included hardware takes care of it) so had to go back and reseat it.Overall this has been the chip I have been waiting for.

Awesome CPU!

  The power is simply amazing!  Video rendering that used to take over an hour now only takes <15 min!  It is expensive, but worth the money.

  Hot hot!!!!!! I am running a watercooling system on an 399x mobo and even with the cpu locked at 3.5ghz it normal temp is 50c thats nuts considering my 1080gpu on the same loop pulls 39c at full load with oc with the cpu unlocked itll hit 65 in 20 min. Thats to much ewkb threadripper waterblock. However the driver fumbled the package when delivered i fear it may be damaged

Perfect for a 3D rendering/gaming rig.
","

  Upgraded from an i7 5820K which is still a decent CPU and my cinebench score has tripled! The processor has cut my rendering times in less than half the amount of time. Gaming is just slightly faster but this was expected. Just make sure you updated your bios first on gen one motherboards.

Best Spaceheather/CPU combo ever
","

  Does not disappoint.For anyone else like me, who wants a good CPU to game with and an excellent space heater, this is it.  The exact model of Threadripper should vary based on your budget and the size of the room you are heating, but any Threadripper can effectively apply a stupid number of physical and virtual cores to any task as well as generating enough heat to burn eggs.

CPU loose in the case
","

  Haven't built my PC yet but I bought this CPU to start it off and as I got it the CPU was already scratched and loose in the case. The product case isn't exactly damaged but there is a footprint of what looks to be a heel (unsure) on the seal part. I cant test it myself to see if it will work so I'm not even going to bother opening it and would rather send it back in hopes to get one packaged properly.

Amd give their customers their best of the best. They deserve it

  Great improvement over the previous generation. The CPU market has been slow however AMD changes everything with zen. They deserve it even though many people may not appreciate how they contribute to the overall markets. Amd will be remembered from the bottom of my heart. I start buying their product because I support them. I havent upgrade since 10 years Amd changed me and how I'm computing nowaday!.. Thank you!

Easily overclocked to 4.1GHz all cores!
","

  WOW! Easily overclocked to 4.1GHz all cores while keeping reasonable temps. Using a heat sink with push-pull configuration will keep the temps ~ 75C. The best is to use Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) via Ryzen Master or Asus BIOS. There is really no need to manually OC 2950X as PBO does an excellent job of boosting the cores.I switched from x99 as Intel fan boy to x399, and I am not looking back.Here is my setup:1. Case: CoolerMaster H500 (not H500p) - Relatively cheap, well built and a lot of airflow, RGB is not necessary. Cable management could be better, unless all your HDD/SDD are m.2.2. RAM: 32GB (4x8) G.SKILL Flare X 3200 C14 - SUPER expensive. It is crazy fast and AMD compatible (Samsung B-Die). I was able to run it @ 3200 with C14 with Asus BIOS set to profile 1 with ease. Please note: that you don't have to get a B-Die RAM, or C14 latency, any DDR4 should be fine. PLEASE FOLLOW MOTHERBOARD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL RAM; DON'T SIMPLY PLACE RAM IN RANDOM SLOTS.3. Motherboard: Asus Zenith Extreme - I love Asus motherboards. There are a lot of negative comments about Zenith, but honestly I have had 0 problems with Asus. The BIOS interface is the best in this space, and ROG community is very helpful. If you are going to overclock the CPU, you cannot go wrong with Asus. VRM might not have as many phases as MSI MEG, or the best VRM cooling, but overclocking 2950x is quite easy with VRM staying relatively cool.4. CPU Cooler: Deepcool Fryzen TR4 - An amazing CPU cooler, but very hard to find (check Newegg). It covers the entire CPU plate! Better cooling than Cooler Master Wraith Ripper, cheaper, and leaves tons of room for the RAM height. I am not a big fan of AIO cooling. Never the less, try to get a cooler that covers the entire CPU heat plate; although such coolers are hard to find. Noctua NH and Cooler Master MA621P TR4 are available and perform great, but I personally don’t like how they look.5. SSD: WD Black nvme – Fast, no need for 970 PRO, unless you want to go at the speed of light.6. PSU: EVGA SuperNova G2+ 850W – No need for more power, unless you are doing 32 cores overclocked.7. CPU: 2950X - WOW! Easily overclocked to 4.1GHz all cores.

This thing flies!
","

  I don't use the system for gaming but it's amazing for photo and especially video editing.  This renders well over 10 times faster than my previous i7 5930k, which was also quite fast, but nothing compared to this CPU.  I looked at this vs. the 32 core version and this actually is better for video editing than the one that is more than twice the price.  I highly recommend it.One odd thing I noticed with it is that my AMD FirePro W9100 GPU (with 32GB VRAM) actually slowed down slightly with it.  I'm working with AMD on it right now trying to see why.  But overall, I love it and I'm a big fan of AMD across the board.

Fantastic for highly threaded workloads
","

  Single threaded performance is competitive with modern high end CPUs but not as good as the best (but much more expensive) Intel CPUs.  But multithreaded performance is outstanding and multithreaded performance per dollar just can't be beat.  Easy to cool, doesn't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're going to overclock.Do not buy this CPU just to game on, in case that's not obvious.  That's not its strength and gaming value is not there (although I am sure it would do fine, but much cheaper options would do just as fine in gaming if that's what you want a fast CPU for).The worst part about this processor though is the ridiculous packaging it comes in.  It feels terrible to throw away a huge hunk of hard plastic and foam just because someone at AMD thought the packaging needed to be so over the top and dwarf the actual processor.  No more ridiculous packaging please AMD.

I feel pretty dumb now

  I RMA'd this cpu thinking it was dead, but really there was minuscule amount of coolant that dripped out when I drained my GPU cooling loop that blew across my motherboard over time and probably ended up insulating the contacts of some surface mounted chip on my motherboard and kept it from even beginning to POST. Saw it, wiped it with a cotton swab and bam, the system started working.
