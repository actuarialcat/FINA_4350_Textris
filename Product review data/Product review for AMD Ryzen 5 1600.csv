This is the R5 1600 12nm refresh!
","

  The original R5 1600 release in 2017 was the 14nm process. This is a refresh based on the Zen+ 12nm process, aka the 2xxx series. This processor can be Oc'd quite well and will perfrom on par with a 2600/x depending on OC. This is a steal for this price/performance ratio.//Update: I've been running at 4Ghz for the last week with no issues, this is amazing price/perf ratio

As confirmed by others, this is the 12nm refresh of the R5 1600, and well worth it!
","

  The good:  12nm refresh of the R5 1600.  A little confusing at first, as I hadn't heard about any such thing, only on researching the part number (YD1600BBAFBOX... note the F in the 4th to last character rather than E), did I eventually find information about this (along with another reviewer's posting here)The bad: not even really that bad, but, considering that this revision of the CPU is closer to being a slightly lower-clocked 2600, versus an original 14nm version of the 1600, it comes with the Wraith Stealth cooler (as does the 2600), rather than the Wraith Spire.  Just a little puzzling at first, and a minor nitpick, as the Stealth is easily adequate for this CPUs needs.I've only had it installed for a few days now, but am very happy with it - an excellent deal for a better-than-expected processor.

Wow! A Ryzen 5 1600 Zen+?!
","

  This is def a Zen+ refresh at 12nm. I did a review on it on YouTube sharing my experience under the same username here. One thing to note is that Ryzen Master software doesn't seem to work with it as it says it is an unsupported chip, but it is legit and works just a hair under the Ryzen 5 2600 performance. The price and performance is amazing! So amazing, I bought a second one! :)UPDATE: Ryzen Mastee software works just fine. If you have a previous Ryzen chip, you just need to uninstall it and reinstall and you’re set.

This is not exactly a 1600 and isn't quite a 2600, but it is a 6 core Ryzen plus ...
","

  This is a 2nd generation Ryzen plus CPU sold in a box indicating it is a first generation Ryzen CPU. It uses the Ryzen Plus 12 nm chipset and identifies as Pinnacle Ridge (which is Ryzen Plus). Mine varies in speed between 2900 and 3600 Mhz. It is likely this will vary by customer, case and random chance with respect to how good the silicon the CPU really is.It appears AMD is selling these as they may not qualify for sale as Ryzen 2600's due to clock issues (they clock a bit slower more or less). They do clock faster than 1600's. Overall for $85 at this time (early 2020) this is the most powerful CPU at this price point ( under $100).If you want a place holder, or just a decent Ryzen Plus at an amazingly good price this is a good purchase. It  will not outperform a Ryzen 3, or even a Ryzen Plus 2600. It will nearly match a Ryzen Plus 2600 though. This CPU, $50 for RAM and $80 for a motherboard, and you can have a Ryzen Plus upgrade for $215. This isn't intended to overclock much, you may get it to overclock a little. For moderate needs, this is a wonderful product.

  Update Feb 14th : I just bought two more of these and pairing them with Amazon Warehouse Tomahawk B450 boards($76 a piece). I decided to sell my old Sandybridge cpu/board/ram and would even upgrade my kids hand me down PC's to these as the price isn't that much considering I get about $80-100 for each of my old hardware setups. What those systems do overclocked with more watts and temps, this does effortlessly stock , cool and quiet. I am a bang for the buck shopper with 7 PC's around the house , so these 1600AF can someday replace my Intel Dual core setups.I recently upgraded my Sandybridge 8yr old 4.7ghz i7 with a 2700x for $136 after cash back from Amazon card(Thanks Tech Deals youtube channel). I liked the upgrade so much that I also wanted a similar feel for 1 of my MediaPC's that I run a GTX970 in. Figured this 1600AF would likely be a great value for a budget HD/4k TV gaming setup. I just finished installing it and I ran a benchmark on my 2700x and then dropped in the 1600AF all stock settings with 3200mhz C16. Without changing a thing except CPU, both runs showed my GTX1070 is 99% GPU bound under ""The Shadow of the Tomb Raider"" benchmark. I know lower detail would help show performance differences in the CPU but for my quick test I am very pleased with the performance at stock. No difference than my 2700x. Max temp is 34c with a Noctua 14 cooler. I will soon move this 1600AF CPU/MB/RAM over to the Media PC case with Prism RGB cooler from my 2700x purchase.(update it's running great as the MediaPC, cool,quiet and smooth) Loving this value. Check out my attached screenshots of afterburner CPU utilization and benchmark results. Hope this helps someone!

1600 AF is the CPU Value King!
","

  Like a lot of others have said, this is the AF version of this CPU, which means a 12nm node with Zen+ updates. This is basically an underclocked Ryzen 5 2600. Gamer's Nexus did a really good YouTube video on this CPU if you are interested in the more technical details.My personal experience is using this with an ASUS Strix B450-F Gaming motherboard and a Fractal Design Celsius S24 AIO cooler. This booted no problem with my motherboard. After doing some initial stress tests to make sure it was stable and everything was working ok, I went back to the BIOS to overclock it.Also, I should note that I did not do a fresh install of my OS after swapping CPUs. I run Windows 10 with whatever the current update is as of Jan 2020. On intial boot, my WiFi was disabled, but I had already loaded the chipset drivers onto a USB drive. I installed the chipset driver, rebooted, and everything was more or less back to normal. I did show all my hidden devices in Device Manager, then went through and removed everything related to my old CPU and old Motherboard. Not really sure that was needed, but it's what I did. Windows did not seem to mind at all, and it is still showing up as activated.I was able to hit 4.0 GHz pretty easily. All I did was change the multiplier from Auto to 40, and TPU from Auto to TPU II. Rebooted and stress tested again, rock solid at 4.0 GHz with occasional single core boosts to 4.4 GHz and multi core boosts to 4.2 GHz. Note that I did not use PBO or really anything else to do this.Temperatures while testing never went above 50c. The interesting part about that is my AIO has a hardware based auto mode that seems to throttle the fans independently of the motherboard. The fans never really seemed to ramp up to maintain the 50c temperature.One other thing I wanted to note was a comparison to my old processor, an Intel 4790k running at stock speeds. I lost the silicon lottery with that CPU, and it would never really OC past 4.4 GHz without running up the voltage quite a bit, to the point where the CPU was running very hot. However, it would undervolt pretty well while running at stock speeds, so I just ran it undervolted for about 5 years. Setup like this, it would run at around 70-77c with the same cooler, and the fans were working much harder.The R5 1600AF runs most of my games with a few more frames at the top end and average (maybe 5-10 depending on the game). However, my low frames and perceived smoothness is night and day. I am easily gaining 10-30 frames on the low end. The desktop also feels a lot snappier.So overall, I am happy. While I didn't gain an amazing FPS boost, my PC is much quieter and my experience is much better. If I did any actual productivity work, I would probably notice even more of a difference. For $85, I am thrilled with this processor. Easily the best CPU I have ever purchased.

Got practically a 2600x with an overclock
","

  Best chip at this price point, totally leveling the competition(even internally) . These chip are 12nm dies, and perform right below at 2600. With an overclock you easily can raise clocks to 2600 levels, and a lot of people are getting 4-4.1ghz in the 1.3v range, though there are still some that canonly do 3.8-3.9 so don't expect that from all. Seems like at least some of these batches are valid 6 core dies binned straight to the 1600, instead of being dies that didn't make the 2600 bins cut. Lot of variance, which you really don't see with most amd. Many of these chips could of made the bin for 2600/2600x it seems.Even at stock these chips are a great buy, but for enthusiast or anyone wanting to take some time to overclock they really shine even more price wise. Hearkens back to the days when you were able to overclock and get the performance of a better chip that was x2 the price.Mine does 4.1ghz @ 1.325v 3533mem(1.175vSoc)  can also do 4.2 @ 1.38-1.39

The best value CPU on the USA market.

  I know not every country has this CPU, but if yours does I say snatch one up. It's 12 nm and at stock uses less power than a regular 1600 and the 2600. Overclocked a lot of these CPUs can match a 2600X. I recommend this CPU for office PCs, productivity tasks and gaming. If you're looking for a cheap 1080p gaming rig pair this with a RX 570 4gb and you're set without hitting any CPU bottlenecks, if you're doing 4K gaming use the difference you save on this CPU and buy a RX 5700 XT(at 4K you're mostly going to be GPU bottlenecked), but if you're looking for super fast productivity results and/or high refresh FPS gaming in my opinion this isn't the CPU for you.Paired with a B450 motherboard and a RX 570 4gb your have a bargain PC :).

  This ""1600"" AF is basically a down clocked 2600. You can use the stock cooler in an extreme budget machine, or throw any descent tower cooler or AIO in it to get it to 4.0 to 4.2Ghz pretty easily.I built an extreme budget gaming machine with this chip and the Gigabyte B450 $50 special and a GTX 970 Master X. Since you can get GTX 970 cards for around $100 on the used market these days, this build is pretty easy to replicate, and is very capable of playing just about anything at Medium to High settings at 1080p.Need a budget photo/video editing machine?

  The bang for the buck you get with this CPU is insane.

I don't see why you would go for any other CPU under $100 unless you absolutely need integrated graphics for a low budget, non-gaming build.I have this paired up with a used RX 580 I bought for ~$100 and I am able to greatly handle nearly every game I can throw at it at 1080p, medium-high settings. My GPU hits 100% usage while the CPU usage can be anywhere between just 20-50%. This is an awesome budget CPU.

As a bonus I found it mated well with all the components within the system and handles a moderate OC of 3.8Ghz @ standard voltage 24/7.

The orphan CPU. Great if you can get it at a good price.

  This is such a unique CPU. Technically a first generation Ryzen but it has second generation features. It's a limited edition ""orphan"".A refresh of Ryzen 2600 (some say 1600). AMD had run out of 14 nm wafers so they used the newer 12 nm ones to build these. It doesn't show up on most QVL CPU lists for Ryzen type motherboards but it's so generic that it seems to run on any of them, without a bios update. I installed this on a MSI B450 Tomahawk MB and it fired right up. 6 cores and 12 threads, its base clock speed is 3.2 GHz but my motherboard throttles it up to 3.6 GHz. Comes with a decent CPU fan (no LED lights) so this doesn't run hot at all. Seems to be a good combo with DD4 3200 MHz ram. Great for 3D creation programs like Blender and most AAA games if you add a good graphics card.Also, it's very low power at 65 watts.I was lucky to get this at the $85 release price which was an incredible deal. YouTube went crazy reviewing this when it first came out. It sells for almost twice as much now as of this writing (May 2020). It's not a good deal at this current price. You could almost get a Ryzen 3600 (3rd generation and 7 nm) for the price now.This beats my old AMD 3850 8 core CPU (125 watts) in performance.I'm going to swap in a 12 core / 24 thread 3900 in a year or so when that price goes down to $200.

I've been able to run it with both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro so despite it being near Ryzen 2000 it's still a 1000 series to the drivers.

  I build quite a few computers every year just for fun as a hobby, and last year was the year of the cheap Ryzen 5 1600AE, the original 14 nanometer process Zen 1 6 core 12 thread processor.This, though, is the AE Sku which just alludes to 12 nanometer picasso architecture.While this chip is very similar to the Ryzen 5 2600, it is actually a 1600 that has just been miniaturized. it has architectural differences from the 2600.That being said, the performance out of the box is smack between the 1600AE and 2600 in multi core, and closer to the 2600 in single thread.this chip didnt seem to have any issues at 4.1GHz - 1.4V all core. At that point, it's basically identical performance wise to the 2600.Worth noting, this also comes with the larger Wraith spire cooler, however mine had an all aluminum cooler, not the copper slug version shipped with the 1600AE. the 2600 ships with a stealth, so this is a lot better in my opinion there.Highly recommended at $80, and even $105... but not more than that. get the 4600.

  TLDR: This chip is the perfect upgrade for anyone who built a sub-$400 budget gaming PC with an AM4-based AMD Athlon processor - the performance difference is night-and-day.This version of the R5 1600 offers performance similar to the 2600 for $40 less.

It works on 300-series boards without the need for a BIOS update, which is very handy given it's effectively a Zen+ architecture CPU in everything but name.The included cooler, while not as beefy as the original AE variant chips, still does a great job keeping this chip cool under load at stock clock speeds. Paired with a GTX 1650 Super, this particular SKU of the 1600 outperformed the Athlon X4 950 by up to 3x the framerate in most games. The difference in synthetic benchmarks were also very impressive for a now sub-$100 chip. (See images)I know I've already stated this multiple times, but it really does need to be said; If you're still using an Athlon X4 9xx or 200GE, now is the time to upgrade, and this is the chip you should  be upgrading to.

Absolute best price / performance on the market short of the R5 3600
","

  I am a huge fan of this AF variant of the 1600. I can confirm this product listing is for the 12nm refresh, running under a Hyper 212 LED vertical push/pull (I have a 1st revision AM4 support model with incorrect slats) and running Crossfire 2x 570 4gb's (unrelated: don't do this, it's not for the feint of heart and very much out of support after Radeon driver 20.1.2).One concern I would have is possible motherboard support- I did purchase an MSI B450-A Pro MAX that did support it out of the box but I have heard anecdotally that it *theoretically* may not play nice with certain motherboards out of the box due to it listing as a 1000 series part but internally it is 2000 series. Very old BIOS revisions of other mobo's may not post or error out attempting to get to OS?Performance is fantastic out of the box, boosts up to 3.7GHz, and stays there, when ram is set to A-XMP (16gb 2933MHz dual channel CL16 here) and during all core sustained settles at 3.45GHz with barely any heat. Mine benches somewhere between the R5 1600X and the R5 2600.Currently with the 1600AF being sold in the USA for $85 and the R5 3600 being on sale regularly for $175 gaming has never been cheaper with CPUs. If you have the budget spring for the 3600 however I am 100% happy long term with the 1600AF. Room to upgrade but I likely won't need to for a long time.

Amazing cpu for reasonable price.

  I understand that it is a common practice but the installation instructions provided are general directions that have the installation process for all the different versions of Ryzen processors instead of just the one that is in the box. This could lead to confusion if someone isn't careful which set of instructions they start following and they could end up damaging they're motherboard or cpu. Years ago I had a fm2 system and ordered an fm2+ cpu to upgrade, I went through two Amazon replacements before I realized that I was ordering the wrong type of cpu. Point is the exchange and return policy was very helpful and convinient. Basically, as long as you order the correct cpu for your system and follow the correct instructions for your cpu, installation will be quick and easy.  Though I've read that this cpu was priced lower previously (as low as $85) I purchased it at $104 and I believe that the $19 difference is well worth it my last system had an integrated A6 5200 Apu and was painfully slow for around $300 (cpu $104, motherboard $70, 16 gb ram $70, 120 gb ssd $25, 600 w PSU $50 free shipping) my system is about 300% faster. Using an old GeForce gt 710 GPU I can even do some lightweight gaming until I upgrade to a more modern card for AAA titles.

  I've purchased two of these over the course of two years. First build was for a Plex server/gaming rig. Temps are cool and the CPU just runs along. I paired this with both a GTX 1060 6GB and a GTX 1050Ti. No issues gaming with either GPU.Second build was for my 7 year old son. He saved up money to build a computer so I obliged and built him a computer for under 400, including 16GB of RAM and an Radeon RX 560. Handles all of his gaming and school duties without a hitch.Would I purchase this again? No, but that's only because AMD gas recently released the 3300X which is a phenomenal deal given its price and power. If you had asked me this question before the 3300X, I would say yes. Clearly though, I would buy it again as the second build was only a month ago.

  Excellent CPU when ""AMD Reseller"" has it in stock. They sell it for $85.PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT FROM A THIRD PARTY SELLLER! THEY ARE PRICE GOUGING!This CPU has an $85 MSRP,  it's a GREAT CPU and is the 12nm (AF) update of the original 14nm (AE) R5 1600.Please be aware, this CPU will most likely NOT work in an A320/B350 motherboard without BIOS update.  Please pair this with a B450 motherboard to get 100% compatibility unless you have a true Ryzen 1000 series or other CPU to upgrade a A320/B350 motherboard.Easily overclocked to 4.0Ghz, same/similar performance as a R5 2600.  (Currently have one in my main desktop).Only major con is the OEM CPU cooler, but you can reuse an AM3 clip-style cooler on AM4 motherboards, and that's just what i did!  Currently using a heatpipe/tower style cooler.  Amazon also sells older coolers for around $20.  If you want to overclock this CPU, I would highly suggest NOT using the OEM cpu cooler.  Upgraded from an FX6100 on my secondary gaming PC, gaming performance improved about 2x with a GTX 560ti.

  I just received this CPU and I am really impressed with it's performance.  This processor cost around $85 and though it is labeled a Ryzen 5 1600AF, it is in all actuality an R5 2600 built on Zen+ and 12nm die.  I am getting excellent frame rates without any overclocking while managing very cool temperatures.  Unless you are doing intense video editing and you want to save some cash, get this before stock run out.  This is an awesome CPU with  6 cores and 12 threads.This processor actually out performed I5 8th gen an I7 7th gen cpu's.Rarely do we get this kind of value in a new CPU.

Relatively modern architecture4. Runs Cool (With a CM Hyper 212 BE Tops out around only 55-62C full load)5.

Literally The Best Bang For Your Buck CPU Available Currently (early 2020)

  First off this is a 12 nm cpu, not the old 14 nm part. The efficiency and performance are almost identical to the Ryzen 5 2600 minus an ever so slight clock speed reduction. That being said, all Ryzen cpu's are unlocked so you can easily overclock it to be the same or better even with the stock cooler included. For $85 you cant beat the performance of this chip. Granted this is still a mid tier chip and performs as such. Don't expect to pair it with a RTX 2080 ti and be equal to a $500 + 9900ks (keep spending lol) cpu. The 1600 AF is perfect to be paired with a used RX 580 or GTX 1060 and have a cheap but decent performing system that you can upgrade in the future when you are ready. I personally am using this for my sff (small form factor) build and am extremely happy with the results.If you've been locked into Intel for what feels like forever and want to break the chains without breaking the bank, give this one a try and I think you will be pleasantly surprised with what you get for $85 bucks!

You can reach up to 4.2ghz overclocking this unlocked Processor.AMD quietly released this new processor  late 2019.Performance is on par with the Ryzen 5 2600.Gaming performance is equal to the R5 2600 in most titles, some titles the 2600 may deliver 1 to 2 fps higher than the 1600AF.The said, the NEW Ryzen 5 1600 AF at $85 is an incredible and unbeatable deal. For 1080 and 1440 Gaming this CPU choice is a no brainer. I will be buying this processor for all future builds.This cpu is not an apu, so it does require a dedicated graphics card.

  This is the AF version, which is arguably the best valued 6-core cpu you can buy right now. It is essentially a 2600 which uses the same 12nm silicon architecture, but is clocked slightly under at 3.2ghz vs 3.4ghz.

And there is definitely room tfor some hefty overclocking if you upgrade the cooler and reasonable overclock with stock fan I am running at stock speeds(no overclock). I did change the thermal compound to thermal grizzly kryonaut.  The CPU boosts up to 3.6ghz when gaming and never goes above 65° even with the stock cooler.  I have yet to see a lag spike or thermal throttle.

  This is a 12nm refresh of the original 2017 AMD Ryzen 5 1600, or you can call it a slightly underclocked 2600. In fact in multicore Cinebench test it performs better than i7 7700k which cost twice. It's a good all-around CPU even for gaming. In case I need more performance I can easily upgrade to 3rd-4th gen Ryzen as they sit on same AM4 socket.It's stock cooler (Wraith Stealth) is decent enough to keep the CPU temperature in 70s under heavy load. I would consider upgrading it though for overclocking or for using in hotter environments.All in all, it's a superb product for the price. For comparison, Ryzen 5 3600 cost (at the time I purchased this item for $85) $175 while it's only 30-40% faster at best. And it's not even worth buying 2600 for $120 or more. There was no direct competitor in Intel area as well, their i3 9100F is almost twice slower in multi-core optimized tasks. So grab this CPU if you find it under $90.

  Easily pushes up to 4 ghz without manual overclocking. I thought it would have a hard time with Destiny or other games of the sort but mine's been effortlessly handling things it shouldn't be able to (on paper) soooo either I won the silicon lottery or this new architecture is truly worth every time.

R5 1600 AF is a fantastic 6 core CPU with a bad stock cooler
","

  So long as your careful to buy the AF variant of this CPU and not the Zen 1 1600, your going  to have a good  time.  This is basically a Zen+ 2600 with a tiny bump down in clock speed, not that you'll ever notice as every software I've run on auto sets it at 3700 MHz and Ryzen master often boasts it's better cores to 4.1-4.2 without my input.  Though this is an amazing CPU for the price I cannot stress enough the need to replace the stock cooler if your case has the room.  It is laughably insufficient for the power and heat this CPU is capable of.  Quiet though, so there is that.

  This is the Ryzen 1600 AF (12nm) version, which uses the Zen+ architecture. It is basically a Ryzen 2600 with lower clock speeds.At its original price of $85 it was hands down the best value budget CPU, and even at the current $105 it is still a great deal and by far the cheapest 6-core CPU.

  85 dollars for a CPU that practically does everything. The new 12nm design means youre literally getting a 2600.  This, with a b450 motherboard/good RAM will give you an incredibly powerful machine. Included heatsink is excellent as well. I usually get aftermarket coolers, but this one does the job perfectly. IMO, any gaming build under 1000USD should use this CPU.

  If you're looking for a cup for a budget computer build then look no further than the Ryzen 5 1600AF. This is the best bang for the buck processor, at the time I'm writing this review. For only $85 you get a 6 core 12 thread CPU that'll handle any modern title you can throw at it. The customer service was fantastic, after receiving the CPU I bent one of the pins while trying to install it. Before buying a new one I contacted AMD to see if it was possible to replace it and within 3 days I received a new one that worked perfectly right out of the box. If you want a good CPU that'll last you for the next few years then the Ryzen 1600AF is for you.

  This is a steal. I got it when it was 85$ and I can't believe how much value this CPU offers. I upgraded from a R5 1500x, and while it's not a substantial upgrade, I do appreciate the extra 2 cores and 4 threads. The cooler included is trash though (even worse than the one that comes with R5 1500x). It's loud and it doesn't cool anything. I was able to squeeze a 3.7Ghz overclock on all cores, with temps anywhere between 65C and 75C during a long gaming session. Just ordered a beefier aircooler that is supposedly much better. Hopefully I could squeeze even more (3.9Ghz or even 4Ghz). Overall, very satisfied and I deducted 1 star for the bad cooler.

Will this poor CPU ever come back in stock at USD $85? Probably not

  Obviously the reason why this CPU was good was because it had the performance of a R5 2600 for $85. Six cores and twelve threads for $85. I should have bought 5 of these when they were still in stock for the ""proper"" price. Soon though, it may be that the wildly successful R5 3600 may drop low enough to provide comparable price to performance of this when it was at MSRP, so hope is not yet lost for budget cluster-computing enthusiasts.

  At $85 USD for this CPU it is definitely the best bang for the buck when it comes to Ryzen processors. Had no issues being detected in a new ASUS ROG Strix B450-F gaming motherboard. This also has almost the exact same specs as the R5 2600 with only a small decrease in core and boost speeds compared to the 2600 with the same 12nm Zen+ process.

  The performance per dollar is insane. 6 core 12 thread cpus would have been $200+ just a few years ago. So finding it for under $100 is amazing. I am using in what is effectively a home office PC, and it is rather overkill. The performance gain over the 1500x and 1200 for the money is a no brainer. Choosing between this and a 3200G/3400G APU is a tougher decision that comes down if you have an old dGPU laying around( Since i had an old R9 270 not being used for anything else so the choice of the 1600 over an APU was easy enough), and if the APU's graphics chip can really push enough pixels for your uses case. (for an office pc the APU probably would have be sufficient.) The included cooler is not ideal, but works well enough. I had a spare Wraith spire LED cooler from the RMA of my 1700 (seq fault issue with early ryzens), and it kept it under 60 C (with the fans set to 50%) while running Prime95 for over an hour. From what i can see the included cooler runs more in the mid 70 C range. If you can find a wraith spire led or similar for cheap it is definitely worth the upgrade over the included stock cooler (wraith stealth) assuming space is not an issue.Running this in a super low end mother board will limit the boosting somewhat. You will want to look for boards with an 8 pin rather than 4 pin cpu power connector, and the B450 or X470 chipset. This is a zen+ 12nm part so earlier boards like B350, and X370 may need a bios update to work this this processor despite the first gen part naming chosen by AMD.

MUST BUY

  (EDIT10/06/2020) it has now been well over 6 months time and ive since upgraded my gpu to a 2070s ftw 3 ultra+ and an ek D-RGB 240mm aio, with  a 144hz view sonic freesync monitor (gsync works) and when figuring out that spread spectrum can help with over clocks well, i turned it off and got my vcore down to 1.235 volts on a x570 gaming wifi edge mb. needless to say im still very happy with this purchase, debating on getting new ryzen when it comes out or just staying where i am...While under full FULL LOAD mine at 4.1ghz @1.28V never hits above for 20 min stress testing on all core with occt stresstest its at 56c.... got to 4.1 merely by bumping to 1.28volts nothing else tried booted first try. Going to tinker more but anyhow...Nothing I dislike traded my zotac amp gtx 1060 6gb gpu for one of these brand new. The guy bought it from this seller. For 85.00 now they raised the price but still well worth. Had a 2400g but more then enough for an upgrade.edit, sad you can no longer get these from the seller that offered a great deal on them in fact no longer available is sad af... but still i got one and am dam happy over this vs my 2400g clocked @ 3.9 @ 1.38volts hit some temps with the aio but yea thankk you amd authed reseller and the guy i traded with.EDIT: since trading or purchase of this cpu ive obtained some WAY better ram, a new case and 5700 to boot with 2tb nvme, and a few other goodies. i have people telling me the r5 1600 AF isnt able to do 3466 ram. so i put some pics in. yea i didnt post stress test pics but i give my word (old backwoods ky boys word) that 8 hours of aida 64 stressing everything but the gpu and drives its stable after that! specs are MSI b450I gaming plus ac, of course this cpu, 4.1ghz @ 1.33 volts LLC4, 16gb 2x8 hyper X 3466 cas 16 ram, 240ml aio, and well thats all you need to know the ram kit i have for this is ( copy this and search amazon) ! HyperX Fury 16GB 3466MHz DDR4 CL16 DIMM (Kit of 2) 1Rx8  Black XMP Desktop Memory HX434C16FB3K2/16 kit, anyhow the ram works on xmp profile 1 or 2. thanks reseller! probably going to snag another here really soon and throw my old tower back together with a new mb that supports 4 dimms and see my luck!

  Ok i did not buy this CPU because i have ryzen 5 2600x, but this is better than normal ryzen 5 1600(which costs 115-125).this cpu is 12NM instead of 14NM which means it is technologically more advanced and simply better.so for a 85-90$ this is the best cpu, it will be good for gaming and also very good for creating content.just buy

Great Value CPU & experience with 3rd party seller!

  Likes -* value, purchased at same price as an Intel I3 9100F from a third party on Amazon at $85.00, 4 chores/4 thread (Intel) vs 6 core/6 thread (AMD) - actually been an Intel fan since they generally have had better single core performance but with the multicore performance being a bigger factor these days, I went with AMD* package arrived early & good condition* with my RAM running at 3200mhz, it boosts to 3.7ghz while gaming or under heavy load (it's rated boost clock is 3.6 but the BIOS adjusts the CPU frequency automatically when A-XMP is enabled), drops to 3.2 or lower during general web browsing or productivity tasks* while gaming, it stays around 10% to 20% usage while my GPU is close to 100% (RX 570 8gb), my Intel I3 4160 was at 100% in the same situation and cost twice as much when purchased in 2016* mine came with the Wraith Stealth instead of the Spire cooler which does the job though I won't be overclocking until it's replaced with an aftermarket solution - Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition or ARCTIC Freezer eSports DUO for example* on overclocking, back in the 90's & early 00's you could see a noticeable impact in real-world situations, now it seems to impact synthetic bench marks primarily so I don't see a need for it in my case though I'll probably give it a go just for the experience at some point in the near future

  Update, this is now the 2nd one I have bought for a build. They are amazing. Successfully overclocked to 3.95 with memory clock at 1500MHz. Pairee it with a Tomahawk B450 MOBO and oloy ddr4 3200 RAM, overclocked to 3350. I have now had a total of 5 VMs open at one time and this thing just does not care. Buying a third for one more build, but will continue buying these guys.This CPU is amazing, at the time of writing this review I have 3 VMs running, GNS3 running, installing Red Hat Linux, chrome obviously open and Vuze running. The CPU is sitting at 34 percent utilization. The CPU sits at around 40 - 50 Celsius with included fan, which is also great. I did not get that much on the overclock, mostly due to motherboard. Was able to overclock to 3.85 with a voltage of 3.5. When put in a stress test still sits between 70 and 80 Celsius. Have played many AAA titles with it and it works just fine, games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, all of the Need for Speeds and The Witcher are on high / ultra-high settings. With this CPU I am using an XFX RX580 graphics card. This CPU makes more a great CPU at a cheap price for a cheap gaming / work computer.

  Its a good starter CPU with overclocking abilities. Only downside is that you'll need a dedicated graphics card. I learned this the hard way.  It doesn't have graphics card integration meaning that it can't give the motherboard display abilities. My B450 tomahawk has a useless HDMI port at least until i upgrade processors.

  The day I heard mention of the R3 3100/3300 being launched, I finally jumped on one of these. $85, they’re practically giving them away. This AF version is everything the 2600 is/was. Great 6 core 12 thread chip that keeps up with the more expensive 3rd gen 4 core chips that cost $20-$40 more.
