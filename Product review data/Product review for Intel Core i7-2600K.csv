  I got this when it was still fairly new in the market, and lasted me up until this year (2018), and honestly, still could have gone longer, but I decided to upgrade to a ssd, and with it all new processor and ram. I went to an amd ryzen 1700, and am very happy with the switch, despite how reliable and great quality this Intel processor is

  This is the best Intel CPU ever built and still holds up to this day.  Overclocks extremely easy if you have a half decent cooler.  I can hit 4.6ghz on just a 30 dollar Coolermaster Evo Heatsink while staying below 70c under full prime95 stress test.  You put an even bulkier cooler on this and you could hit even lower temps, but the thing is, you really don't want to put more than 1.5 volts into it 24/7, so staying below 4.6ghz is the best idea.  I like to keep mine below 1.45 volts.

Excellent, Stock Fan is Fine, Good Power & Heat, Love the HD Graphics 3000
","

   I could not be happier with this CPU.  I really wanted HD Graphics 3000 that is built into the chip, which (1) has built in optimizations for HD video playback and conversions, (2) can offer a lower power usage than some power hungry graphics cards (less power, less cost, less heat, less noise from less heat to exhaust, and more reliability from lower heat), (3) is better than many entry level discrete graphics cards.  Of course it doesn't really compare to the current generation of expensive high end graphics cards that cost almost as much as this chip, but it gives others a run for their money.  I really wanted to make sure that viewing, editing, and converting video from my HD video camera was as optimized as possible, which is what HD Graphics 3000 can uniquely offer by being optimized right on the CPU.  In terms of power, my system idles at about 50W.The stock fan provided with the retail version is all that you need if you are not overclocking and have a case with decent airflow, like the 

Cooler Master Storm Enforcer

  .  The desktop tools monitor (from my 

Intel DZ68BC motherboard

  ) always shows that I am running at the low end of heat ranges for the CPU and temperature in my case.  Heat hasn't remotely been a problem.  I don't think the fan is whisper quiet though.  However, there 2 important things to mention. (1) The power cable comes wrapped around the fan in what looks like cable management that you don't have to unwrap all the way.  But the problem is the cable actually comes into contact with the fan blades at a few places that you might not notice at first.  This would make noise, cause cooling problems, or burn up the chip if you don't unwrap it.  I thought at first I could just uncoil a tiny bit to plug to the connector right next to it, but I am really glad I caught that.  The instructions made no mention.  (2) It didn't snap easily into place like the instructions say.  I had to use a screwdriver to turn the nuts in the end on a few posts, but overall was easy, but I had to use a screwdriver despite instructions that said otherwise.The 2700K versus this 2600K offers only 100MHz more, that's all, and is only a fractional improvement.  So you just need to calculate the cost difference between the 2700K and 2600K and see if that is worth a measly 100MHz or not.  If only a very small cost difference, I would definitely go with the 2700K.  If a moderate or large difference, I wouldn't pay too much for only 100MHz.  When I bought my i7-2600K, I would have had to pay 22% more to get far less of a gain in processing power.  I have zero regrets with going with the i7-2600K and not waiting around for the 2700K to be a perfect value.

Amazing power in a desktop PC!
","

  This processor is simply astounding.  Period.  I've run several benchmarks with it and have been totally satsified with the results.  Forget i7 950's or even the ridiculous 980X; this processor shreds them all in most apps.  It is also fairly energy efficient and is the OC champion of the day.  Seriously, overclocking this processor is as easy as changing the multiplier in the bios to whatever you want (mine is set at x44 giving me 4533MHz).  Add a decent cpu HSF and you can easily see 4.5-5.2 GHz on air!!  These 32Nm chips are seriously quick and the Ivy Bridge processors of later this year will fit in the 1155 socket.  Now is the time to get in on the Sandy Bridge bandwagon for sure!Pors:  Amazing stock speeds with incredibly simple overclock ability/Energy efficient/Low temps/Next generation architecture/AMD who???Cons:  None that I can think of...Other notes:  Buy the less expensive i5 2500k if you do not plan on heavy video encoding etc.  The 2600k's feature set is pretty much useless for pure-gaming performance....

Great CPU, Super Fast, but might be overkill for some
","

  I have to start by saying that this Intel processor is just super fast, REALLY EASY to overclock even your grandma can do it (lol search for the video in youtube) and depending on how you see it, the price is awesome. On synthetic benchmarks it will perform *almost* as well as the infamous i7-990x which is a six core CPU and it costs $999!!! The i7-2600k comes with regular (and cheap IMO) cpu fan cooler, but it does the job, if you are not planning to overclock at the beginning just use the stock cpu fan. This processor is for enthusiast, hardcore computer builders, people who run virtual computers, and photo video editing. If you are a gamer only or planning to use the computer for regular basic stuff, please save some money and buy the i5-2500k instead. 90% of your computer needs will be pretty much the same with an 2500k which can be overclocked and it also has 4 cores (but no hyperthreading). You will save +$100 which can be put towards an SSD or a good video card.Pros:Super FastQuad Core  8 Threads with HyperThreading)Easy to overclock, all I have to do with my asRock gen 3 mobo is to enable ""auto overclock"" to 4.4 ghz and thas it.Temps with stock fan: 34c idle, 82c load using Intel Burn, NOT overclocked (coolmaster enforcer case, ambient temp: 80f-85f)Temps with Corsair H60: 29c idle, 70c load, overclocked to 4.4 ghzThis CPU will most likely never be your ""bottleneck"".Integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics will do an awesome work with your basic graphic needs.Cons:Might not be the most for your money. again 90% of people will be better with an i5-2500kCheap Fan, you need to buy an aftermarket cooler to overclock it.Neutral:VT-d was disabled from the K version, you dont know what is it? then you dont need it :)Conclusion, you want to have the fastest computer, show off your friends, overclock, and money is not an issue? Get this processor. If you are in a budget, dont care about having a bigger ""e-p3n1s"", you game only, or basic stuff, get the i5-2500k

Fast and cool
","

  I rarely write reviews.  I figure there are plenty of folks that do and who cares what I have to say?  But this is one product that definitely needs to be mentioned.  I needed (er, wanted) to update a computer and the cost of the 920/960 cpus were so close in price I thought why not try out the Sandy Bridge?  Granted, it required me to update my motherboard too but, computers don't live forever right? ;-)So, why all the fuss?  First of all, forget using the stock cooler.  I reused a Cooler Master Gemini IIs cooler from the previous i7/960 build I was replacing.  When I got it all back together, MB,CPU and RAM (new), boot drive, PS and case (reused) along with the cooler it powered on 1st time.  After updating the new MB drivers I ran the Windows experience and went from/to:Processor 7.6 / 7.8RAM  7.6 / 7.8Graphics  7.2 / 7.4Gaming  7.2 / 7.4HD  6.9 / 6.9So, not a HUGE jump coming from a 960(still plenty of good initial benchmarks) but the kicker is this runs (with the exact same cooler)11c cooler!  Previously, @ idle it would sit around 50c.  I have been running this overnight and it is currently at @20% usage and barely hits high 40s in a room that is 25c/77f.I am still in the process of running other benchmarks but for the price this CPU gets it done.

An extremely energy-efficient and fast processor even in non-overclocked setting
","

  The Intel Core i7 2600k is an outstanding processor. It's extremely good for multitasking such as ripping videos and other CPU intensive tasks at the same time. For the amount of tasks load, it appears to use less electricity than previous generations of CPU. But in order to use this second-generation i processor you would have to upgrade the motherboard as well because it uses socket 1155. It's not compatible with the first generation socket 1156. Both socket 1156 and 1155 uses the same heatsink and fan configuration and fit, therefore can be reused on this new platform. This platform uses DDR3 exclusively.This processor is extremely good at idle power usage in it's default non-overclocked state. The motherboard that I've bought contains the Intel H67 chipset and therefore doesn't allow the multiplier to go beyond 34 therefore does not allow overclocking. This doesn't matter to me since the processor even in its stock state is extremely fast and extremely energy-efficient to boot. The reason I bought the 2600k which is essentially similar over the 2600 is because it no doubt that he came from a higher bin up at Intel's fab.This is what I think, the 2600k version is better and more than likely came from a higher Intel bin number lot. This put it this way, when Intel manufacture processor within a given family on a fab. Each CPU chip is fully tested at different speeds and functions. The best ones are reserved for the highest speed and the lower speed ones are place in bins lower down in order. Some of the chips that has defective sections have those sections and more turned off and configured as a different model such as ones with less cache memory. Some of those lesser chips may even have some functions permanently disabled and sold as cheaper CPUs models such as with and without Hyperthreading even though they came off the same fab.This model also has a better onboard graphics engine than the non-k version. This feature is not important for me since I use a separate graphics card. This CPU works like a charm and approximately three times faster than my previous one which is Intel Core2 Duo E8500 clocked at 3.2 GHz.

Fast and stable - typical Intel quality
","

  I'm a long-time Intel processor fan, and the i7-2600K no doubt continues that tradition.  I don't have anything to add, from a technical perspective, that hasn't already been covered here, so I'll focus on a few things that matter to me.First, I don't keep up with the latest, greatest in computer hardware these days.  I needed a new workstation for the house, and this processor looked like it would fit the bill.  So far, I've not been disappointed.  When paired with a SSD, my system flies.  CPU intensive tasks like transcoding videos now take a fraction of the time they did on my previous Intel Q6600.I know the stock Intel CPU cooler isn't very well respected by most enthusiasts, but to-date, it has met my needs.  After hours of gaming or transcoding, I'm seeing a maximum temperature of around 45C using the stock cooler.  To be fair, I've not tried overclocking this processor yet, and if and when I do, my CPU cooling needs may change.  But, I think that provided you have a good case with a good cooling solution working there, the Intel CPU cooler should at least get you by for a while.Anyway, I'm quite happy with this purchase.  As an ""old"" IT guy, this processor has been a breath of fresh air.  The prospect of overclocking this thing has me looking forward to tinkering with hardware again for the first time in a very long time.Regardless of what you're planning to do with this CPU, it is the typical high-quality you'd expect from Intel.  I'd have no reservations in recommending this to anybody.

i7 2600k: Just about the fastest processor that you can actually afford!
","

  This processor simply SCREAMS. I think I might actually be able to hear it?No, really, it's that fast. I upgraded from a 3.9ghz q9550 quad-core, and the transition is AMAZING. My q9550 @ 3.9ghz was about equivalent to an X6 1090t at stock clocks... however, this i7 seems to have doubled my computer's responsiveness. So, that means it's very, very, very fast. I'll post some hard data benchmarks on here when I get my cooling system optimized.So far, I've seen anywhere from a 10% to a 40% increase in gaming performance, depending on how CPU-reliant the game is. I've nearly doubled my FPS in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood (very CPU-dependent) and GTA4 (also very CPU-dependent), while I got a modest 5-15FPS boost in Crysis 2 maingame (not-so-CPU dependent).The good news is that this processor only hits about 60*C with a 4.2ghz overclock, using a modest watercooler and a good case. I have a Corsair H60, and I'm seeing about 60*C. I went pretty light on the thermal paste (Arctic Silver), but adding more won't change too much. Make sure your system is ready to handle the heat. I've maxed out at ~4.7ghz, but decided not to tweak voltage over 1.3V.Pros: + Unbelievably, freakishly fast.  + Actually pretty dang efficient (~3-5 watts idle, 70-80w max load).  + Very overclockable.  + Runs relatively cool.Cons: - Some applications are too old-fashioned to use Intel Hyper-threading. Bummer.- Intel HD graphics are useless. AMD APUs actually have a GPU.- Doesn't wake me up in the morning and make my breakfast like a good little computer.- Boxed cooler just takes up space (wouldn't it be awesome if you could save $15 and just buy the processor?).In the meantime, I strongly suggest getting this CPU if you have the need or desire to build a killer machine. If you don't want to break the bank and get the best machine out there, check out the i5 2500k, which is also a totally killer processor.Current Setup:i7 2600k @ 4.2ghz (100.0fsb x 42mult)Corsair H60 WatercoolerASUS P67 Sabertooth REV.B38GB OCZ DDR3 1333mhzEVGA GTX 470 (JET ENGINE)Antec 1200 PC Case (Awesome)Cooler Master 1000W PSUWD 500GB 7200RPM + WD 1TB 7200RPM HDDs

  Very fast, and those effective 8 cores allow you to do many things at once, all at full speed. There also is a 2700K model available for $50 more. That'll give a 4% faster CPU for $50. Whoopie. You'll never see it unless you run a benchmark.Pro:There are 2 issues controlling the speed you get from a modern, multi-core CPU: The number of cores and the speed of each core. This CPU runs 4 cores, each of which your operating system can hyper-thread, giving 8 effective cores. The multiple cores allow several demanding processes each to run at full core speed, and so the speed of each core determines how fast each of those applications runs. This chip is a winner on both counts. But you'll need Windows 7 x64 or 64-bit Linux to take maximum advantage of what this chip offers. It really screams.For we techno-geeks, following are some benchmarks: Floating point calculations are critical to the performance of my image processing and numerical analysis work, so I ran my standard double-precision floating point benchmarks on a single core running at the stock speed under Windows 7x64 Pro and 1600MHz DDR3. This benchmark mixes different proportions of add/subtract/multiply/divide operations doing real-world calculations. A mix of [50%,0%,50%,0%] -- that is, only adds and multiplies, which run very fast -- gives 4.8 Gigaflops (billion floating point operations per second) per core. For a [43,29,14,14] mix, which is relatively heavy on the slow operation of division, I get 1.6 Gigaflops per core, which still is exceptional. Putting this in perspective, the stock i7-2600k gives 10x the performance of a Cray YMP supercomputer of 1992, and is more than 1000 times faster than my Sun Sparcstation of the same era. On the other hand, the stock i7-2600k is around 1/4000 as fast as the Fujitsu ""K computer"" in Japan, the world's fastest supercomputer that eats 12 Megawatts of power and costs $10 million/year to run.Con:The CPU fan that Intel provided was a bit noisy. I could hear it wind up in RPM when the CPU came under a heavy computing load. For a few bucks I replaced it and all was good. Mine was probably a fluke, so don't let that get in the way of purchasing an i7-2600k.In summary: Get this chip --- it's a dream. You'll not find a significantly faster CPU near this price for at least a couple of years.

One of Intel's best processors yet.
","

  The i7-2600K is a last gen product but it's still a solid work horse for those on a budget. The K after the 2600 means that it's great for overclocking if that's your goal. The OS will see those 4 cores as 8 cpus and use each one according to the needs of the running program. That means if you suddenly see that one of the cores is running close to 100% then you're assured that, like James Bond 007, another core will be available to takes its place when needed. The onboard Intel video isn't as good as the newest generation but you can spend less than a C note on a dedicated GPU with at least a GB of video RAM that'll kick Intel's a$$ anyway. But even if you're just a modest gamer then you wouldn't be caught dead without a dedicated GPU anyway, right?If you can afford it I suggest going with the latest and greatest CPU since it'll give you the most longevity with all the latest technologies but for the most bang for your buck you can't go wrong with the 2600K.

Vcore is 1.475 and I'm using a Swiftech watercooler.The beauty of this CPU is in it's scaling which lets it run at a cool 1.6GHz when idle and instantly ramps up to full speed when needed and then back down again.

  I got this to replace the g620 CPU chip in the HP p6-2011 I got for free.  The difference is like going from driving a Mazda Miata to a Dodge Challenger SRT8.  I bought a video card and maxed out the RAM since I wanted dual screen monitors, run a server, and occasionally play games.  I got a cheap 1GB DDR3 graphics card and I can run Starcraft 2 on ultra settings.  It provides >=30 fps in a match at any given time which is enough for me and that's the recommended settings.  I'm sure I didn't need the card but i had two DVI monitors so i had to get something.I failed to mention I haven't overclocked it either so I'm sure doing so will only further the performance, but since this is installed in my server I don't need that kind of performance.  Also, another thing of note, the overclocked version is cheaper than the non-OCed version, which is strange to me, but whatever.  I'd suggest researching both if you plan to go with a generation 2 i7 processor.

  I've been using this chip in my workstation for several weeks now doing intensive video editing and CG production. Thus far I've had no issues with the CPU. With a Spire Thermax II heatsink and Cooler Master HAF X case, I've managed to overclock this thing to about 4.5GHz with temps around 30 Celsius idle and 70 Celsius under full load. I managed to clock it to almost 5.0GHz, but I found my chip started to heat up into pretty dangerous territory.Previous to this chip, I was using dual Xeon E5600 series chips at 2.4GHz with 16 threads. This chip absolutely DESTROYS those chips. With 3D rendering I've noticed an increase of about 40% in speed in identical renders. In After Effects I'm able to scrub through pretty much any of my projects with minimal to no wait times. Rendering video is also pretty fast. HD footage doesn't quite render in real time, but it sure doesn't take long.For just over $300 this chip is an absolute steal. Without forking over $1000+ for an i7 990x, I doubt you'll find a better CPU on the market today.

  This processor is insanely fast! Definitly top notch technology. I made a jump from an Intel Core i3 to this processor and the speed difference is fenominal. If you aren't looking for a gaming computer however I would recommend an Intel Core i5. I took down a star though because one of the features of this specific processor is the overclocking ability and to my surprise the stock fan that came with this processor sucks at cooling it down. I would recommend buying an after market cpu cooler. I had overclocked the processor from 3.40 GHz to 3.80 GHz (taking in mind that it was a stock cpu cooler so I decided to leave it at 3.80 GHz instead of over 4.00 GHz like most people do) and the temperature went up from 40 degrees to 60 degrees. Good thing the motherboard senses the processor temperature and shut the computer off before it reached unstable temperatures.

Amazing Processor!

  OK to the guy who said it has no advantages over the 2500k or the Athlon:  Yes, it does.  It is faster.  It may not be much faster, but you really can't down-rate the processor because you think it is overpriced.  The rating is supposed to be about the performance and quality of the product.  There is a sub rating for value if you feel it is not worth it.  As for the processor, I can't say enough about it.  I'm easily overclocking it to 4.43Ghz using a Corsair A50 Heatsink.  No temp issues and when it comes to rendering video, audio or any kind of compression, this thing kills the competition.Great Processor!

Great Processor! - Nothing But Good Things To Say Here
","

  Intel continues to improve on its processor design and architechture.  Dies continue to get smaller, use less power and generate less heat.This processor has not disappointed me in any way.  It's rock solid, and overclocks effortlessly.  Although I have experimented with this, I run my CPU and memory at slightly higher than stock speeds, and allow my MB to manage CPU and memory performance dynamically.  This offers more than enough computing power for my needs - webdesign, photo/video editing, and some light gaming.Having 4 cores, 16Gb of memory, the right software and x64 bit OS to handle this architechture has really made video editing fun again.  If you are looking to strike a balance between performance and value... This is it.

Good for some venues

  Benchmark reviews from tech sites show this processor to be MUCH faster than the i5-2500K when it comes to 3D rendering (still or animation), creating or editing video, file compression, fractal generation, or anything requiring constant real number crunching.  To the point that it is arguably worth the extra money.This is due to the CPU enabling hyperthreading, combined with having a larger memory cache.For regular uses (web browsing, word processing or other office apps (including spreadsheets), watching video), and to be succinct, the 2600K is overkill.For a price:performance ratio, the 2600K is hard to beat.  Especially if you do content creation.

This thing is a hoss...
","

  I apologize in advance if this review is a little vague on some of the specs of this CPU. I'm not doing this FROM that computer, so I don't have any of the exact details to go off of.I've had a handful of computers [desktops and laptops, including a $5,000 Sager 9262 I bought in 2008] over the years, but they've always been pre-assembled, and I've always wanted to build my own desktop gaming rig. Having just gotten back home from Afghanistan, I had a bit of cash to finally throw into an attempt.I won't go TOO into details on my rig, but I got the Corsair Obsidian 800D with a Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD7-B3 Motherboard (Mobo), GeForce GTX 570x2, Intel SSD, and Corsair 16gb of DDR3 1600Mhz RAM. And of course, the i7 2600K.#1 - Installation - First of all, installing this thing was a cinch. [For my motherboard] All I had to do was lift the locking mechanism up, remove the dust guard, set the CPU on the contacts of the Mobo, and lock it down. I second-guessed myself when I did this, thinking it should have been a smidgen more difficult, but nope. Simple as that.After installing every other component in my case, and turning this bad boy on, I immediately went into the bios to check it out. You can get pretty deep into the settings on this Mobo, but I got the hang of it rather quickly and familiarized myself with the capabilities of this processor. I didn't overclock it right off the bat (good idea for anyone), so I could get a baseline performance test (before and after, so to speak). I installed the OS and whatnot, followed by a few games like Crysis, Bioshock 2, Arma 2, etc.#2 - Overclocking - The factory clock on this is 3.4Ghz (multiplier of 34). I'm currently pushing 4.4Ghz (or a multiplier of 44) with AIR COOLING, and without getting extremely hot. I plan on getting liquid cooling over time, but I'll wait for that.#3 - Performance - As I'm not at that computer right now (doing this from work), I don't remember my exact framerate (FPS) in these games, I CAN tell you that it's extremely good. If I remember correctly, I got around 65 FPS on Crysis, and ARMA 2 with all graphics settings maxed out. I know that half of that may be the 570s, but this CPU helps A LOT!#4 - Price - For $340, this thing blows the concept of ""getting a deal"" out of the water! The 2600K is regularly compared against the 990x in stats and performance, and the 990x is nearly $1,000!All in all, I give this thing a 5 out of 5. It's a bargain price for some high-performance, and high-quality hardware. It'll slaughter anything you throw at it, and then some. It's compatible with all current-gen GPUs and most RAM.I definitely recommend getting this CPU if you're planning on building your own gaming computer. It's way beyond nice to have. It's one of the most powerful consumer CPUs out there, and by far the best power-to-dollar ratio out there.

Expensive!

  I usually build cheaper computers and go AMD, but i went with this processor after doing a lot of research.  This processor is amazing when it comes to gaming and converting videos. The benchmarks are great too.  Do not go with stock cooler.  I bought one off of Amazon and it is really tall but it never goes above 32 degrees Celsius.  Hard to put this processor under a full load as it can handle a lot.  Also easily overclocked in my motherboard.  It was clocked at 4.3 ghz and ran fine.  I prefer to get a full life out of it so I just keep it at stock which... is simply amazing regardless.  I find it hard to believe anyone would need to go above stock speed.  BUT it is overclock-able so have fun with it.

Used to build a Digital Audio Workstation.
","

  Most people you see doing reviews for this are usually game enthusiasts. There are magazines dedicated to building ""Dream Machine"" PC gaming computers. So as a musician looking to build a Digital Audio Workstation  (DAW), most articles and reviews were not helpful. Definitely do your research as to what programs will be using and if the processor matches up. I use Cubase to record with. Fortunately enough, Cubase DOES utilize hyperthreading. Makes everything a little speedier and quicker. This thing is amazing as a for my DAW. I can run multiple VST's on tracks unfrozen with barely any CPU usage. I think with about 8 VST's, my CPU usage was only 7%. And thats insane since my last machine only had a dual-core @ 1.5 Ghz. On my dual-core system, that would have ran me up to about 30-40%.I run Cubase to record live tracks. And I use FL 10 ran through re-wire into Cubase with Superior Drummer(X64). With additional drum library packs that eat up ram (56% of my 8G of Corsair Vengeance RAM TBE). This processor never goes above 20% usage. It stays at a constant 3.8 GHZ with Intel Turbo Boost. I haven't had the need to OC this thing. It blazes through any audio rendering. With aforementioned programs running, I can render a .wav into .mp3 in around 30 seconds!! It used to take a minute to a minute-and-a-half on my dual-core.If you are looking at processors to build something for recording, this is the best thing to look at. I have seen other DAW's running the same programs with other leading processors, and there is no comparison.

The king of consumer CPUs (for now)

  Yes, Intel is just beginning to release the next generation of CPUs in the LGA2011 socket. But, as we have seen with the frustrations that have arisen out of the Tic-Toc approach, the sockets quickly change. The LGA1155 is a great bet right now as there has never been a wider selection of quality motherboards available. Add to that one little fact: The 2600k (or the 2700k for that matter) is a performance beast. It can out perform a two year old twin xeon setup and it has plenty of thermal overhead for some very nice over-clocking on the stock cooler. You won't go wrong choosing this for a new PC build, even today.

  well this processor has allot going for it that even the newest processors can only match (especially AMD, bleh). Overclocking is its strong point, got it to 5.2 GHz with water cooling of course no sweat and runs stable. Another high note is the hyper threading and it also takes fuller advantage of the OS you use and overall performance of anything u throw at it like games, apps, etc.. etc.. I would definitely recommend to those not willing to pay an arm and a leg for the newest set of processors to hit the market. This processor still has allot of potential and thats just the tip of the iceberg what i described, I'm still learning its nuances. Great buy and overall great value. 2 THUMBS UP TO INTEL!!!

Best CPU for the money right now

  I believe this is the best CPU for the money right now. I've heard arguments between this and the 2500k, but the 2600k flat out hauls. I have it hooked up to an MSI board and is over clocked to 4.2 ghz with 16 GB of RAM. I ran some bench marks and it was getting numbers near 11,000. Intel has some other processors for $1,000 that have bench marks around 11,000 at stock speeds. Really the only processors faster are the new 6 core Intel's. You could pay $20 more for the 2700k get, but give you very little extra. If you have the money get this chip. There isn't one website that doesn't have this as a 5 star product.

So I started from scratch and built ""The Beast"".  i7 2600K, 16 gigs DDR3, and all the bells & whistles.  This thing blows away my wildest dreams!  I have never had a computer (or seen one) that just does what you tell it to do- instantly.  No waiting!  Massive upgrade from what I had before.  I highly recomend this CPU- not only for the performance, but also the price.  The only chips that will out perform this one are the 1366 i7 extremes, and they are still at the $1000 price point!  BUY THIS PROCESSOR!  You won't be disappointed.  It just leaves me with one question- How much faster will CPUs be in the future?  In the last 5 or 6 years things have changed dramatically, so what will they be like in 5 or 6 more years.  This processor already does most anything faster than I ever thought possible.  If I had another chip today that was faster, I don't think I could tell the difference....instant is instant!

Fantastic CPU -- and I don't even overlock

  For those who think I'm nuts for getting an unlocked overclockable Sandy Bridge CPU, but haven't chosen to overclock it, I assure there is a method to my madness.These unlocked CPUs are certified by Intel as operating well at higher clock speeds. To me this says there's a good chance they'll last even longer and be more stable when left at default speeds than the locked version -- and for only about twenty bucks more (at current pricing). Plus I love having the option to overclock, should I choose to do so.Anyway, installation was a breeze, and I'm cooling it with a 

Corsair Hydro Series H80 High Performance Liquid CPU Cooler (CWCH80)

   (with a pair of

  So, let's be honest... Games don't really require this much power.  This thing is a tank, and seeing the 8 threads all hovering around 2% while using my computer is kinda cool.  I justified this by suggesting that I needed the power for my computational projects, but I'm not been able to really challenge it, outside of benchmarks.  It flies.  Overclocking is well documented online, and my experience mirrors that I've read online.  It is capable, and according to online benchmark value estimations, it is only a little less performance per dollar as compared to the 2500K, so I felt like it was worth it for the money I spent.

  This processor flies! I can literally have Photoshop, pro tools and battlefield 3 running all at once, and the system is fine (w/ 16gb corsair vengeance kit). If you plan on overclocking (hopefully you do) be sure to install a custom fan (maybe one by coolermaster) I highly highly recommend this processor if your doing anything serious on your rig!

  There must be a thousand reviews of Intel's I7 processor. The speed is absolutely scalding.  I haven't tried any of the benchmarks but I haven't been able to slow it down much less stall it.

Outstanding value for the price

  The i7 2600K is the obvious performance and value champ since the invention of CPU.  Its performance rivals high-end Intel CPUs that are sold at $600 or above, yet it's sold at around $300.  It may also be the best CPU in terms of its performance / power usage ratio.  Easy to overclock and very stable.  Very happy with the purchase.

  It's actually fairly amazing to me just the shear amount of power contained within this processor. At times, I'm worried the box in my room will become sentient and upload the launch codes or something, bringing about the doom of mankind. Until that happens, however, I will continue to play my games at ultra high settings with the highest resolution (as a side note, that's also with an EVGA GTX 560 ti SC on board) and make videos to document such feats.I highly recommend this processor for the enthusiast who wants to be able to brag to his friends and bring about the end of the world.

  Overclocks easily, even demanding applications will have a hard time maxing out this processor at normal clock settings.

  I was hoping to save up and buy an i7 Extreme. However, after doing some reading and research, I realized that sometimes there are cheaper processors that give more bang for your buck. I googled up this neat site that compares processors by performance and then how it relates in terms of pricing. (passmark Software Cpu benchmark) If you don't have the money, but want the kind of  performance that can still compare with a more expensive processor, this is the one for you. With the option for overclocking to 4.5 Ghz (which I haven't done yet, because I have yet to get liquid cooling) it is a stellar performer! It's got all the bells and whistles to make this a powerfully performing, yet energy efficient processor. My only concern is the small heat sink it comes with. I would not risk overclocking with it. Definitely get a proper cooling system before doing anything in the overclocking department, especially if you live in a warmer climate like I do. A good buy. No regrets! :)

Stock Fan Stinks

  So far I love this processor. Was able to overclock it to 4.5 GHZ on air (After getting a aftermarket cooler). When I had the stock cooling fan on, and running it at just 3.4 GHZ the processor touched 83 C. I since installed an aftermarket cooler, and overclocked to 4.5 GHZ. The processor doesn't get above 70 C even after long gaming sessions. One other thing is on the installation of the processor when closing the bar on the motherboard it makes a crackling sound. This made me very nervous as I don't remember any AMD's doing this, however, the computer runs just great!

  Great processor - have it overclocked to 4.6GHz. Wasn't able to bump the BCLK at all though before I got math errors, not even to 100.2. Runs cool under my H80 hydro cooler.

  This processor is so much faster than my prior build, a Core i7-920, it's amazing.  This puppy is almost as fast as the fastest $1,000 Gulf Town processor, for 1/3rd the price!  It's performing flawlessly for me so far.  I'm still playing with the overclocking, but some of my friends have gotten this chip up to 5.2 Ghz and beyond using just air cooling on the same motherboard I have, the Asus Maximus IV Extreme.  I'm still playing around in the high 4s.The design of the Sandy Bridge CPUs appear flawless.  I'm just bummed that they wasted all those transistors on a useless (for many of us), mediocre video processor.The ""Cougar Point"" P67/H67 Chipset problem is easily avoided.  Just don't use the Intel SATA II ports on your Motherboard!  No big deal if you have a good quality Motherboard with ample SATA III and non-Intel SATA II ports.  How many people have more than 4 Optical and HDDs in their system anyway?  The fellow who blamed the problem on the Sandy Bridge CPUs is entirely off base and unjustified...

Sealed box contained fan only
","

  After buying many Dell pc's over the years, I was looking forward to finally building my own. Unfortunately just like a previous poster, my pretty blue box arrived with just the fan and no processor. I could swear the box was sealed and showed no sign of having been tampered with. Amazon provided a return label for the fan, but couldn't send a replacement chip, because they were out of stock. I've spent loads of money with Amazon and this is the first time anything has gone wrong. It's hard to point fingers without all the facts, but I think it's fair to say one of two things happened. Either the packer at Amazon should have noticed the missing chip, or the packer was responsible for removing the chip.The good news is that Newegg had it in stock (at the same price) and is overnighting it. I hated to spend an extra $20 for next day, but I'm anxious to get it.This will in no way change my high opinion of Amazon. They are a great company that provides terrific products and service.Update: Now having used this CPU for a month, I can say it's fantastic! Low heat and VERY overclockable. Mine is perfectly stable at 4.6GHz on my Maximus iv motherboard. The recently installed Intel SSD 510 has been a great addition as well.In regards to my receiving only the fan and no CPU on my first order, I probably was unfair in my finger pointing. I was very upset at the time. I have no idea what happened in my case, but I'm sure this has only happened in a very small number of cases, so not anything to worry about.

i7 2600k Sandy Bridge
","

  Kind of pricey for its Price v.s. Performance.The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 following reasons:-First of all, Not all 2600k chips are the same.  There are a few chips out there that can overclock better then others. (Which is I think is very annoying.)-Second, It is only slightly faster than the i5 2500k. Like the tomshardware.com article says; ""The $100 spread between the Core i5-2500K and Core i7-2600K is only recommended if you want to brag, because you're probably not going to notice any appreciable frame rate difference. The Core i7's strength is only really exploited in heavily-threaded workstation applications, rather than games.""

  I just ""upgraded"" my 

Intel Core i5-2500K Processor

   to the 

Intel Core i7-2600K Processor

  . A local retailer was running a deal that couldn't be passed up. I do a lot of GIS work, run Adobe Creative Suite and commonly have a VirtualBox session running. I know how to make the cores sing. For my purpose, this is a good investment. For most people, however, the 

Intel Core i5-2500K Processor

   will be a better solution.One thing that I did notice right off - this chip overclocks higher than my 2500K. Maybe I got ""bin"" lucky. Problem with overclocking is that you can't tell what the upper end will be until you crank up the clock speed. In the exact same box, with the 

Corsair Hydro Series H70 Core Liquid CPU Cooler - CW-9060002-WW

  , I could not get the i5-2500K to run stable over 4.2Ghz where the i7-2600K is currently set at 4.5Ghz. I haven't tried to go any higher because I will have to rethink the fans on the radiator. Right now, under full load, the CPU creeps up to about 85C. That's still well within acceptable temps. Right now I have just a single 

Noctua 120mm Adjustable Speed Fan

   running at 600rpm in a push configuration. I can try cranking up the RPMs on the fan or even add a second fan so I get push-pull.Update: It was just pointed out to me in the comments that my temp is too high. Intel's specs say TcaseMax is 72.6C. What the sensor reported in CPU-Z measures is about +10C over TcaseMax. So at 85C, my CPU was stepping outside the chip's tolerances. I'll have to play around with either reducing the clock speed or moving more air through the radiator to get the temps down. Maybe I can even get the clock speed up some more!

  This is the first standalone processor I've ever bought and I haven't tried overclocking before.That being said, I consider myself a power computer user. When I built a computer from scratch earlier this year, I knew I wanted the best parts. Using this processor is like putting a V10 engine in your car, with the limiter removed.In 6 months, I have not been able to stress this thing out! Here are some programs I've used on high performance settings, often more than one at once: Photoshop CS5, Illustrator CS3, Crysis, The Witcher II, iTunes, Chrome, Firefox, Vuze, Microsoft Office, Audacity, Minecraft (highest settings + super texture packs). Nothing slows this beast down. All of this is at stock clock speed (3.4 GHz). If and when I feel that I need extra juice, I know I can pretty safely push it to ~4.5GHz or higher. Honestly though, you probably won't need that much power. The only way I could see you topping this sucker out is if you're doing heavy video editing, 3d model rendering, and extremely processor intensive tasks (e.g., phylogenetic analysis) all at the same time (or maybe running >5 virtual machines).Power consumption and heat production are fine at factory clock speeds. Before you overclock, do your homework to make sure you don't fry your motherboard. I never hear the CPU fans, which indicates that it doesn't run super hot. My GPU fans far exceed how much noise is made by anything else in my computer, and if you're a power user, that's probably the biggest noise factor to consider.Also make sure you get an appropriate motherboard. This is a fairly new processor that uses a new socket. I went for the 

ASUS P8P67-M PRO <REV 3.0> LGA 1155 SATA 6Gbps and USB 3.0 Supported Intel P67 DDR3 2200 Micro ATX Motherboard

  . It's a pretty good motherboard, but if you go for that one in particular, ensure your computer case is an appropriate size. It's pretty big.All in all, I'm extremely satisfied. If you're at all curious about overclocking, I recommend this model over the 2500. Both are likely more power than you'll ever need, though.

BEST CPU Available...States one of my PALS...

  +s: This CPU is packed with power and possibilities. I'm really amazed with how much Intel packed into this CPU for only $295.00.Built in GPU on the CPU. If you use an H67 or Z68 MB you can use the CPU as your GPU w/o having to purchase a dedicated graphics card. This feature is disabled on the P67.The K version gives you HD Graphics 3000 instead of HD Graphics 2000.The K version is unlocked to give you full OC capabilites when using a MB with the P67 or Z68 chipset. I have been up to 4.8GHz using the pre-programmed OC settings on my MB w/ just large air cooling.-'s: The K version does not support Intel TXT, VT-d, or vPro.As with all CPU's, the included stock heatsink/fan and thermal paste are terrible. If you are going to OC you need to get a better cooler. Even if you don't OC you will get much lower temperatures and (depending on the cooler) much less noise using a better cooler. A high quality thermal paste will drop the temps another few degrees Celsius as well.Other Thoughts: To really get the full potential of this CPU I recommend using a MB w/ the Z68 chipset. When I made my purchase months ago only the H67 and P67 were available. The H67 gives you access to the onboard GPU, but no OC capabilities. The P67 gives full OC capabilities, but turns off the onboard GPU. The Z68 gives you full OC capabilites, access to the onboard GPU, and additional features.System Information:ASRock Fatal1ty P67 ProIntel i7-2600KASUS Royal Knight CPU cooler2 x EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti4 x 4GB Kingston HyperX DDR3 1866Thermaltake Black Widow 850W PSU4 x Seagate Constellation ES 2TB SATA3 in RAID 13 x Lite-On DVD-RW burnersCooler Master HAF X full towerWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit

A great foundation for a great GP and gaming system.

  This CPU makes for a great general purpose and gaming machine. As far as the stock cooler and fan, I found it to be more than adequate for me to over clock it to 4.5 Ghz. It kept case temps at 35 to 37 Celcius at idle and at abt. 68 cpu degrees at gaming, loaded at full bore DX11 and hi settings on several current games like Crysis 2 and Skyrim and the like. I guess it's important to have good air flow in the case. And not loud fans either. I have a total of three case fans one cpu fan and one psu fan. It overclocks very easy in the bios. As far as getting the I7 2600K over the I5 2500K I figure that the 2600 is more future proof, being that as time goes by more cores will be used. When it gets to where one needs more than four cores the extra threads will come into play. So when things get to where one needs six to eight cores this CPU will still perform and when higher speed cpu's are needed it will overclock to over five GHZ, and then better cooling can then be employed. So as I see it this CPU has a long life.

  Before I recently upgraded my system I was running and Intel Q6600 processor overclocked to 2.8Ghz.  I was really on the fence about upgrading since the previous system was so good.  However I started having stability issues after 3 years at 3.0Ghz and had to drop it to 2.8Ghz.  I was also starting to get artifacts in my video output that I was able to diagnose as a motherboard going bad.  Instead of replacing the board on a 3 year old machine, I just upgraded the whole thing.Here is the hardware I picked up:- 2600K- Coolermaster Hyper 212 heatsink/fan- 2 x 4GB Gskill Ripjaws DDR1600  model F3-12800CL9S-4GBRL)- Asus P8P67LE motherboard- OCZ Modstream pro 600W modular PSU- LIAN LI Lancool PC-K7B CaseAfter years of overlocking - mainly in college - I've lost my taste for it for the most part.  Pushing computers to the outer fringe of performance, just to constantly battle with temperatures and stability just no longer became appealing to me.  Because of this, I wasn't going to go crazy with this processor.  At default voltage, I upped this processor to 4.4Ghz and it doesn't get above 55C at full load with the Hyper 212.  This processor stays cooler at 4.4Ghz than the Q6600 did at 2.8Ghz.  I could push the processor further, but it's so fast already that I don't see much of a point.  It handles everything I throw at it (including data heavy image processing and rendering) with aplomb.  I have had *zero* issues with stability since I built the system nearly a year ago.  There were some early firmware bugs with the motherboard, but ASUS has these ironed out now so you can buy with confidence.Clock speed is only half the story though.  Given that instructions per clock (processing efficiency) is much higher, and you're getting a much higher frequency, the cumulative benefit is HUGE.  I mainly use my computer for photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop.  While generally very quick, there was noticeable lag when using some of the adjustment brushes in Lightroom with my older system.  That lag is completely gone with the newer system.  In various benchmarks, the new setup has almost twice the processing power of the old setup.  My Lightroom export time for ~450 5D Mark II RAW files has dropped from approximately 25 minutes to approximately 15 minutes.I'll also address the elephant in the room here - the 2500k.  The 2500k can be found for about $100 less than this processor and to be perfectly honest, it's a better value for most people.  They have the same number of processing cores, but the 2600k has hyperthreading.  This allows each physical core to take on two threads of data for an available *8* threads of processing while the 2500k can only handle 4.  So, if you find yourself frequently maxing out 4 processing cores, this processor will be a benefit to you by allowing you to some processing power while still running 4 full threads of data in the background.  This won't give you twice the computing power, but you might well get an additional 10-15% in some situations.  For me this means I can export photos from Lightroom (which uses about 70% of my 8 available threads) and still be able to work in Photoshop smoothly.Earlier on in the manufacturing process, there was speculation that the 2600k processors were ""binned"" higher than the 2500k - which meant they had more overclocking headroom.  However now that the process has matured, you can be pretty well assured they are both equal in terms of maximal clock speed.  This seems to be around 4.6-4.8Ghz with high end air cooling at safe voltages.By most objective measures, the 2500k and 2600k are the best high performance desktop processors you can buy today.  For just over $300, this will be the last processor you need for a long time.  Fully recommended.

A CPU That Screams & Holds Its Value - Get The K!

  It is a bit amazing to me that this CPU has only dropped $3 in price since I purchased it in 11 months ago.  It probably shouldn't surprise me though as it is still one of the best and fastest CPUs on the market.  It is rated for 3.4Ghz and I've been running it overclocked at 4.2Ghz without a problem.  Just make sure you get a good cooling fan!One note and something I originally missed, Intel has two models the i7-2600 and this one the i7-2600K.  The K is vital if you want to overclock as the non-K units are locked down and won't let you play around with the speeds.  Make sure you get the ""K"" version if you want to push the CPU to its limits and get the most speed that you can!The bottom line is I love this CPU, it's fast, the cost is reasonable and it has been rock solid stable even overclocked.

  The 2600K. It doesn't need much of an introduction but I'll add my two cents. First of all I really like this CPU and Z68 and am glad I got it. I really like the Sandy-Bridge platform so far.  I wanted to do some overclocking, be able to use the integrated gpu with Quicksync alongside my GTX580, and have 8 threads on tap for apps like X-Plane. So this cpu and the Z68 chipset is a great low-cost, high-performance solution.That being said, it's not the best CPU in it's class overall, for every user. If it had VT-d and Trusted Execution Technology, then it would be. As it is, most people would probably find the 2400 on a Z68 motherboard ideal, overall, as it does everything well. Most gamers/overclockers on a budget would be better off with the 2500K on a P67 motherboard, getting a great overclocking cpu and saving a hundred bucks to put toward the best 3D card they can afford.There is some confusion because of how Intel have their i7 product line segmented, with three types of sockets and multiple chipsets. But it's really pretty simple if you just focus on Sandy bridge and socket 1155. I think there's three main choices that present the most value and performance, the 2400, the 2500k, or the 2600K. Most day-to-day home or office computer users and overclockers/gamers won't need this particular i7 cpu and would be well-served by either the 2400 or the 2500K, respectively. Those who need Trusted Execution Technology (TET) and VT-d and also want Quicksync have the 2400 or 2600 to choose from. The 2400 with a Z68 motherboard is a real sweet spot for value/performance and does everything well. It has all the features except an unlocked multiplier, but it does have the ability to overclock the turbo mode (which I expect works well overall in current games that don't utilize lots of threads ). So I'm sure that the 2400 would suit most people overall, even power users and those who play demanding games. Enthusiasts who mainly want to overclock and get the best 3D card they can afford but don't care about quicksync or Hyper-Threading would be happy with the unlocked 2500K and a P67 based motherboard. Those like me who want overclocking , quicksync, and all 8 threads have this great cpu. If it did VT-d and TET it would be truly all-purpose. As it is performance-wise it can hold it's own compared to the thousand-dollar 980X. If you run X-plane and overclock then this is for you! Eight fast threads. Yum.I upgraded from an Intel X3380 overclocked to 3.8ghz on Gigabyte EP45-UD3P with ddr2-1066. This is a nice upgrade. Not revolutionary, but nice and smooth. I'm not sure how much of the added performance is from the ddr3/z68 platform and how much is just this cpu, but I'm happy. Eight threads is nice! Nifty processor. Very fast. Runs at low temperatures. Efficient power-management that never seems to effect performance. Value-priced (remember when an unlocked cpu used to cost a grand?). I'm assuming that most people considering this cpu are planning to overclock it, and from what I can tell it's ideally suited to that, except for the fan/heatsink that comes with it being kind of puny for serious overclocking. I'm using a Noctua NH-U12P and it's great.I have it installed on an Intel DZ68DB motherboard with 16gb of Crucial Vengeance ddr3-1600 and a Kingston 64gb SSD V+ with windows7 64bit. As an aside, I know it's a bit strange that after everything I just said about overclocking then I got this motherboard, which is not an ""enthusiast"" motherboard. But the fact is that Sandy bridge makes it so easy to overclock that unless you plan to push really high voltages you don't need to spend a lot on an enthusiast board to get most of what the cpu has to offer. I wanted an Intel board, so that's what I got. I like their extensive product support, attention to sound engineering over hype, the onboard Intel NIC, and overall system stability. And who better to integrate drivers for their own chipset? I'm not sure what I gave up by choosing this motherboard, except the ergonomics of this board are not the best. The PCI-Ex16 slot is way too close to the cpu and ram, and ram is too close to the cpu socket. Nonetheless, I got everything crammed in there with good airflow and it can overclock enough to suit my needs so far. I'm not sure how much of a gain there would be to push it much harder, to have all cores running at peak all the time. I wouldn't mind higher clocks full-time but I like it the way I have it set up. It's so efficient, cool, and stable, and snappy performance. Once I start using X-Plane I might want more speed on all eight threads at once, we will see. The board can support that if I want. But I'm just biding my time till Ivy bridge and socket 2011 anyway.So far I have just been adjusting the max turbo frequency. I settled at 46 for one/two cores, 45 for three cores, 41 for four cores. Works great. I like it this way for a number of reasons. I have Hyper-threading enabled and all the power management features enabled. When idle it sits quietly and cool at 1.6ghz .99v. It can spike up to 4.6ghz with up to four threads cranking along (hello games), hover around 4.5-4.4ghz under heavier loads, and fully stressed it cruises at a steady and cool 4.1ghz/1.26v (8 threads maxed!). It does all this without ever going over 1.34v/55C which is well-within spec and I haven't even tweaked the voltages, just let the motherboard handle that automatically on default setting. I did raise the wattage for burst and sustained mode, but only modestly (134/128). I left the max cpu amperage at 97. I had to mplay around with the burst/sustain mode levels and the relative max turbo levels per core until I settled on this stable configuration. I could easily push this rig harder to full-time OC at 4.4/4.5ghz by turning on Turbo fulltime and adjusting voltages manually, the board supports  that, but it's working so well the way it is that I don't want to change it. (besides it's not the beefiest board and I don't want to accidentally cook it).I am liking it the way it is. I am getting 4.4ghz-4.6ghz consistently in games, which is great. Performance/feel is smooth. Handbrake rips average about 200fps (8 threads at 4.1ghz), which ain't bad, but I thought it would be better than that. The x3380 got about 150fps on average. Who knows, might be running into the limitations of the hard drive config. Have to play with that.When I setup another monitor with the on-board video and start using quicksync things will really start getting interesting. Also when I get my X-Plane cockpit rigged up. I wish I could add that to the review but I don't have any experience with either yet, I just know that the hardware is supposed to work well. We'll see. I'll add that to the review when I have some results.Anyway, happy camper here. thanks.

almost 5 years old and still kicking a$$

  almost 5 years old and still kicking a$$! I still have this processor in my backup rig and surprised with a GTX 750TI, this thing still plays the latest games at high/medium resolutions. Feels like Intel is hitting a road bump as the difference between this and the new 6700K is not much in terms of regular applications. I know the integrated graphics is a lot faster on the new 6700K but in terms of processor performance for excel etc, the difference isn't really felt much in regular windows applications. This thing maybe good for another 1-2 years before ""HAVE"" to upgrade!

A beautiful Processor with Overclocking Capabilities
","

  I bought this processor a couple months ago for my PC and it is absolutely great! (I actually got a deal on it from microcenter when it was paired with a z68 motherboard so if that's still going on I would check it out. sorry amazon) It has been reliable so far and incredibly speedy. I have yet to come up to something it can't handle and I haven't even bothered overclocking it yet. Which brings up a decent point. You should definitely be sure you will utilize the overclocking capabilities before buying the K. I don't regret it, because I know down the road I'll use it, but for some people it might not be worth the extra money.With that said, this is a great processor from intel and I would definitely recommend it for new PC builds.

  I have owned this CPU for about three and a half years now, and it STILL has not let me down. I have it overclocked to 4.4GHz with barely a hiccup. Keep in mind that the stock heatsink is not enough, especially with integrated graphics. I highly recommend a large heatsink (I use a big ole Zalman one) to keep it cool. This thing even meets standards nowadays, with eight processing threads and a huge amount of overclocking room. If you are on a budget and need some Intel-powered speed, this gem is the way to go.

A Must BUY! Best Bang for the Buck...
","

  Pros:* Overall the processor is extremely fast and reliable...* Overclocks Extremely fast and easy.* Low voltage compared to my Q6600 (between .95-1.3 depending on Turbo and frequency)* Have overclocked to 4.6Ghz and 4.9Ghz when turbo kicks in. Totally stable and runs only 2-4degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature during full throttle and runs at 75-82 degrees Fahrenheit (21-30C) during idle PC work (internet surfing, etc.) and up to 50C or 145ish F. Very cool for the speed and transistor count. I have experience with a $100 X4 AMD running at 4Ghz and when this processor is set to 4Ghz it runs circles around AMD. (I realize the price difference but do not be fooled when your friends try to one up you with a 4Ghz AMD and this spanks the 6-Core as well)* According to Sandra Utilities at complete stock settings with mem set to 1066(had bad mem) it was fastest score on list and I rated in at 800th place out of every benchmark in world! and at 4.6Ghz with new ram running at 1866 I was rated the 270th fastest score in world.  I was rated at 117GOPS. Freaking AWESOME! My Q6600 only scored a 36GOPS running at 3Ghz... So huge improvement!Other Thoughts:* For basic overclocks between 4-4.4Ghz it is as easy as typing in 44 in the multiplier and hit save and close. DONE! That is it... For 4.5-4.6Gh you need to increase voltage a smudge and save. With my Gigabyte UD7 I simply set the Vcore Voltage to ""Level 1""(Small increase) and save. Still very easy. For 4.7Ghz-5.2Ghz you will have to Learn how to adjust many settings- (Turbo On/Off?, Proper Vcore, and proper mem timings to go with the those speeds. All doable, but time consuming in the beginning. Find the sweet spot and you are off. This is assuming you have a $50+ dollar air cooler or H70 Water block.If you have any questions about Overclocking, etc, let me know. My system is as follows:* Cooler Master HAF X (AMAZING CASE)* GIGABYTE GA-P67A-UD7* G.SKILL Ripjaws X (17000) 8GB (2 x 4GB)* COOLER MASTER Silent Pro Gold Series RS800-80GAD3-US 800W (completely silent)* EVGA 570GTX Super Clock* Prolimatech Megahalems Rev.

Still fast for its price
","

  This processor is used on my home desktop and has been working very stable even on slight overclocking. The temperatures are lower than the previous i7-950 that I had, and performs much faster. I'm a power user and have a lot of programs that uses the CPU power a lot, and it helps to have the clock speed working at over 4.0GHz all the time without any heat issues. I use this CPU with my ASUS Sabertooth P67 motherboard with Corsair Vengeance 4GB x 2 DDR3-1600 RAM, with an AMD HD5870. Software that I use frequently is Adobe Photoshop CS5, and the processing time for applying effects appears instantly without delay, which saves me a lot of time.Even with the newer chips that are out now, the 2600K is still a great CPU for its price and fast enough to handle most of the average person's computer tasks. If you are not concerned with catching up to the latest technology and spending hundreds of dollars more, you won't notice a big difference between this and the newer Intel offerings such as the 3930K that my friend owns. I tried using his computer and the same photoshop software and didn't notice much difference, perhaps a bit faster on loading files than my own PC, but maybe because he also got a SSD operating system drive.I'll probably use this CPU for another 4-5 years until there is a huge speed difference with what's out there. Right now I don't see a need to buy the newer i7 models.

Watch RAM Speeds

  As everyone else has stated... this processor is a beast and will last you many years without the need to upgrade. But as I implied in my title, watch your RAM speeds. This processor is only rated to handle up to 1333 MHZ RAM speeds. Most enthusiast RAM speeds are 1600mhz+ and when I used 1600 mhz RAM, this processor failed on me after 2 months. I might of got away with it, but I was also overclocking the processor up to 4.0ghz and it finally died on me. Luckily, Intel has awesome customer service and replaced the processor under warranty. They warned me not to use any RAM over 1333 mhz with this processor.Hope this saves someone else the trouble of replacing every single component in your system to find out it was the processor that failed (first time this has ever happened to me).

Great Proc - But the HSF is HORRIBLE
","

  Pros: - Great Proc.  Handles everything I throw at it like a champ.  Benchmarks incredibly well at stock, don't see why you'd even need to OC much at all. - Supposedly OCs like a champ too. - Cheap.  Third the price of the 990x and very comparable to that processor.  Blows anything AMD out of the water.Cons: - New Socket 1155.  Didn't affect me as I wasn't upgrading from first-gen i-series, but could see why this would irk some people who were. - The stock HSF is TRASH.  Almost impossible to seat right with dumb tab system as opposed to screws and coldplate used on aftermarket HSF.  Then, when you get it up and running, temps SHOOT UP whenever you tax the proc a bit.  I prime95-ed mine at stock (Turbo Boost was on, but set down to only 3.6 GhZ instead of the default 3.8 GhZ) and, literally within 15 seconds, I hit 87 Celsius.  Insanity.  I saw no temp stabilization in sight so I quickly aborted the burn test.  I understand that if you're OCing, you should really do so with an aftermarket HSF, but to run a processor at stock or below-stock speeds and hit 87 after 15 SECONDS?!?! That's ridiculous.  The chip would almost be better off if I opened the case and literally blew air out of my mouth onto the processor (exxagerations, of course).Other Thoughts: - Intel is basically banking on the idea that non-overclockers will never tax this proc to anywhere near full load @ stock.  I basically have to agree with that tenet, as right now, the highest proc % usage I've seen in non-benchmarking regular use is probably 25 if that.  But still, I find it a bit dishonest to make a HSF that allows your own proc to hit dangerous speeds at STOCK within SECONDS.  I even tried replacing the stock thermal paste with AS5, still no luck.  I'll probably deal with it for now, and only hardcore game after obtaining an H70, H80, H100, or other such aftermarket cooler.  All in all though, amazing proc, laughably horrible HSF.

I didn't see much difference with this processor and 8bg ram vs a 2.7ghz Core 2 Duo with 4gb ram.

Windows Experience Index gives this a score of 7.8 in my system.

The closest desktop AMD processor is the AMD Phenom II X6 1100T, which has cpu mark scores only in the 6000 range.  Passmark also has a price-to-performance chart that rates your best bang for the buck, though many of the highest scoring processors on that chart are simply much slower and much cheaper.I am very happy with this:  it overclocks extremely well and stays very cool.  It runs all my programs with blazing speed, including BFBC2 with all settings on high.

  So if you did a search for this processor you should see the 980x below for 999.99.  Well with a little overclocking this chip can do what the 980x does!  I just built my new setup ( my first build ever) i love this chip!  I bought the 2500k i5 first but took it back and boy i am glad i did.  If you are considering this chip, stop now and buy it! ::: HOWEVER NOT FROM AMAZON :::I got it at my local Micro Center for 279.99.

Great CPU screw Amazon Liers

  I bought this at a certain price.  Then 3 days later it dropped by $30.  I contact Amazon support by chat and the person tells me oh you'll get a credit on your next purchase.  It won't show up but it will be automatically deducted from your next purchase.  This did not happen.  When I talk to them a 2nd time they tell me that they will not in fact match their own price change even days form the purchase after being told I would get a credit from a previous representative.  I have spent nearly $2,000 on Amazon during a 30 day period.  It really pisses me off getting lied to about something like that.  They dont seem to have the corporate backbone to understand thats a no go to keep a customer happy that drops thousands a month for their business on your site.As far as the CPU.  Its a mean screaming machine.  Overclocked out of the box to 4.8ghz with the H100 Liquid CPU cooler.  Runs 25-30c temps at idle and this thing is just insane for encoding my MKV to MP4 files for my new Apple TV.  I am also using this in a Hackintosh setup with  16gig ram and this is one of the nicest machines I have yet to use.CPU A+++Amazon Support Staff F--- You

Not worth it, get sandy bridge-e
","

  This CPU by computer standards is pretty outdated and uses an old lga 1155(still in use but should be phased out for lga 2011 and 2012).If your building a LGA 1155 rig I would recommend this CPU but be prepared for it to be outdated and fast.Price to performance ratio this was also a disappointment.. not satisfied at all, waste of money!

The i7-2600K Sandy Bridge has no obvious strengths and is overpriced.
","

  This chip falls short of the performance boost it needs to match its price tag. For anyone building a Sandy Bridge system I highly recommend reading this article first [...]In short, for a gaming system the $330 i7-2600k offers no performance boost over the $225 i5-2500k (no extra FPS in games). The 2600K does provide a slight processing advantage over the 2500K in desktop applications(multi-tasking, encoding, rendering). But the AMD Phenom X6 1090T with its 6 cores and a price tag of $230, offers as much performance for desktop apps, if not more, as the i7-2600K for again $100 less. Like the tomshardware.com article says; ""The $100 spread between the Core i5-2500K and Core i7-2600K is only recommended if you want to brag, because you're probably not going to notice any appreciable frame rate difference. The Core i7's strength is only really exploited in heavily-threaded workstation applications, rather than games."" And even then you can get that desktop performance from the Phenom 1090t for a third less cash.For a gaming rig put that extra money into RAM or VidCard or your Mobo maybe a good cooling system because the 2500k and 1090t are both ripe and begging for some overclocking.P.S. Dont forget about the P67 and H67 Sandy Bridge chipset recall by Intel.

An icon and juggernaut among Intel CPUs
","

  This Intel CPU when it came out reset the perormance bar in 2011. Sandybridge annhilated every previous technology in CPU processing power. How does it hold up today? On stock clock speeds it is average among todays standards. At OC speed set to 4.6 (on air cooling) it can keep up with technology years ahead of it such as the i7 6700k. Make no mistake.. if you own this CPU still and have it overclocked it is not worth it to buy a new CPU. Keep loving your sandybridge and upgrade your other components.
