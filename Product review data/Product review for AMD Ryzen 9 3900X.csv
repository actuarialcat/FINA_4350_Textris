The forbidden machine
","

  This thing arrived in the mail like any ole package. For me it was just another boring day, I decided to open the box and take a peak inside.... immediately the sun shined down its ray of light and people were harmoniously singing in the background. I immediately shouted to be quiet, I didnt want them ruining this moment. I reached in the box with my sweaty clammy hands and pulled out the ryzen 9 box. I stared at it...... and it stared at me. I couldnt wait any longer, I rushed in the lab where I began ripping the box from the PC. Standing outside my door all you could hear was the clanking of metal and the sound of sparks as I installed this beautiful piece of hardware in my PC. I knew what I had was magic.... it was one of a kind. I wanted to show it off so I headed to an Intel convention where people shrieked and ran in terror. They knew what I had brought was over thirteen levels higher than their most powerful tool.... the i9. After all of this, all I have been through I could finally say I had the better processor. Anyways, I would reccomend!

  Phenomenal CPU, absolutely crushes Intel's 9900k (which is roughly the same price) at most tasks.  Intel does have a slightly higher base clock speed so it has a slight edge on single core benchmarks - though this 3900x has plenty of room for overclocking and exceeds the Intel at single core tasks for the same clock speed.The extra cores and threads on this CPU set it above the rest for real-world tests and multicore benchmarks.  Excellent CPU for streaming, gaming, video editing/rendering, and just about anything else.The only reason not to buy this is if you are going to wait for the 3950x in September, which has 2 more cores and 4 more threads for $250 more.I highly recommend this CPU, and also suggest pairing it with one of the new x570 motherboards - I have the ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero myself and love it.Update:  Cable management is important of course.  CPU cooler that ships with this CPU is solid, haven't had any issues so far.

Biggest generational  jump in performance in my CPU purchasing history (30 years)
","

  I’ve owned Intel from 80386 (386) to 6700k Skylake, AMD Athlon 64, Ryzen 1700 and now I just upgraded to 3900x.  What an amazing CPU, with the incredible jump in IPC performance, even Adobe Lightroom is faster, Lightroom(!), do you know how hard it is to move that glacier.I’ve heard some gripes about there not being much headroom for overclocking.  I’ve overclocked every CPU in the past only because they left so much performance on the table.  This CPU appears to do a great job of getting every bit of performance out of it that overclocking for a minute gains is not worth it to me.  Its performance is monster straight out of the box, I think the early BIOS from the MB manufacturers are running the voltage a bit high on default settings.  I tried setting it at 1.3v but it made a big drop on boost performance.  I settled on leaving it on auto with an offset of -.1125 and I do not see a performance loss (Cinebench).

Insane performance even with reduced power cap set
","

  I managed to get it from Amazon by watch-dogging the page, but it took some effort because it barely stays up for a few minutes before people snap whatever stock there is up.  Hopefully the supply pipe will iron itself out so others aren't left just staring at pictures!The 3900X... well, its just insane.  As you can see I'm not using it on a desktop, so no gaming reviews here :-).  I actually have it in a rack doing bulk application builds, and in that regard the performance is really bordering on the insane side.  It wipes the floor with whatever I throw at it.  I have it in an ASRock B450M-PRO4 motherboard which worked great after (of course) I updated the BIOS.In this particular case I tested the CPU to around 150W on the socket (200W at the wall) and it performed excellently.  For my particular use-case, though, since I stuffed it into a 2U rack mount with a low-profile 65W air cooler, I decided that things were a little too toasty so I used the BIOS setup to limit the socket to 100W (150W at the wall).  The CPU is still a beast even limited in that fashion.  The 3900X at 100W socket (150W wall) is twice as fast as my 2700X is at 190W (wall), and ever faster if I let it stretch its legs.  It blows away everything I have except my TR2990WX.  I am very, very impressed.I will throw in a few provisios here for early adopters.  First, if you intend to stuff a Zen 2 CPU into an older motherboard remember that you have to update the BIOS first.  Second, the BIOSes are really early and some motherboard vendors haven't gotten updates out with the latest AMD AGESA, so if you are an early adopter on an older motherboard be prepared to face some difficulty.  I didn't have any problem with the B450M-PRO4 that I stuffed this 3900X into but I am having trouble POSTing a 3600X on a B350 Gaming-itx/ac.  It's clearly just an early BIOS issue since once I do get it to POST successfully (takes a number of tries), the system is rock solid.Third, I do NOT recommend that anyone try to overclock on these early BIOSes.  Wait for the BIOSes to mature a bit more because trying to do it on these early BIOSes runs a real risk of burning your chip up.Other than that, enjoy!  It's an incredible CPU.-Matt

Set Amazon to notify me when available.  Got the message hit the 1-click-puchase button faster than I ever have.  The item was purchased 7/8/19 and shipped Tuesday 7/10.  I received the CPU safe and well packaged on Friday 7/12, a day earlier than Amazon quoted at time of shipment.After updating the BIOS, and running a few final benchmarks on my Asrock x370 Taichi motherboard, I shut down the system and removed my 1800x (this CPU will go into my daily driver system and relieve my r5 1600 CPU slated to be installed in Mom's PC).  Warning!  Make sure to move the AIO fan wire out of the way of the CPU die and the cooler surface.  I had a boot loop and overheating/shutdown session.  Was able to get into the BIOS and see the CPU temp at 101c Wow! LOL no wonder it was shutting off.  Anyway after seeing my stupid mistake, and re-seating the AIO cooler, the next boot-up took forever and 10 minutes to boot into Windows.  Once Windows recognized the CPU and it was running, I started running some benchmarks.Now, I'm not a gamer, so again I am comparing my work load of video editing and production as well as rendering.  With one commercial project alone, I my render time has dropped from around 20 minutes to 12 minutes... that's 40% improvement.  I can render some commercial projects up to 4 times per work session.  I've been very happy with the performance so far, but I'm absolutely blown away by this processor's ability.  Rendering a 1 hour 1080p video usually takes an 1h 10m or so.  I re-rendered last week's video and that time dropped down to around 42 minutes.  My productivity is going to go through the roof.Spending $500 on one single item that is smaller than the palm of your hand can be mind-blowing for some people.  It may also cause some heartache and possibly buyers remorse for others.  Here's the deal, when you consider purchasing this CPU, you must do some research.  Know exactly what you will be doing with your system to insure the performance gain is there.  If you are a gamer, this CPU will play every game very very well.  While it never claims to be the best in gaming, it is definitely meant for heavy work loads. What an outstanding and simple upgrade for a system that will provide another 4 years of great productivity.As a side note, I have been eyeing up an AMD Threadripper build for the past 9 months.  My work requires high core and thread counts which enable the jobs to render much faster.  I had already saved my money to invest into the 2950x and was still saving for the motherboard.  Considering the fact that I earn a living with my PC, a professional workstation is in order. While it's exciting to order a new ""toy"", I hope you plan for something like this.  It makes your purchase even sweeter when you ""just know"" you got a great product for a reasonable price, and it will do what you need it to do.  Also, looks like I need to update the name of my system now LOL.  It's not an 1800x any longer.Cheers!

Great porformance for less money than Intel

  I have not had the processor for very long, but its been great so far. My old processor the Ryzen 1700 was a good, but the 3900x essentially doubles the processing power it had. As far as single threaded apps you may not notice a huge difference. It's not until you use it on a CPU hungry program that you really notice a huge difference.I have mined a little bit of crypto just to test things out compared to the Ryzen 1700, it has doubled the hash rates it was getting. Other than that and running a few bench marks it hasn't been used a ton, but so far it been as good as the reviews online have been saying about it.

  Installed this CPU on Thursday, Computer ran fine until Sunday evening. After playing Tomb Raider for 20 mins the monitors shut off and the computer never booted again. After troubleshooting and swapping the CPU for a Ryzen 7 the system booted again. Now because Amazon do not have any of these CPU's left I'm having to fight with AMD warranty and these guys are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. 3 days of back and forth emails with AMD and they are still yet to actually approve the RMA. Amazons response to this was to buy another processor from the Amazon market place for $600+ and wait till next month to get it , what a joke !

Issue is with Amazon, not the CPU.
","

  Let me first disclaim that my 1-star negative review is not directed towards the Ryzen 3900x CPU, as I have not even got to the point of even trying out this CPU yet! My issues are directed towards Amazon and how they are handling their products.I have been working with computers nearly my entire life, I am in my 30s now and begun as far back as I can remember at least 4 years old, I am no stranger to installing hardware and no stranger to fiddling with hardware either, I have been an intel loyalist for the better half of ten years due to issues I always ran across in the mid-2000s with AMD.Any product I got AMD related I had issues and issues and issues with, which is why I made the swap to intel originally years back, to avoid issues, so I was not on good terms with AMD when swapping from intel back to AMD with the Ryzen 3900x, I figured though I would give it a chance, on first glance the CPU looked good, although I did not take a detailed look before installing, as the box was shrink wrapped(poorly mind you). The CPU installed fairly simply, the computer booted up as normal, posted and went straight to bios, this is where my problems started, I noticed the CPU temps in the BIOs was a little high, which I googled to find an avg, my thermals were much higher than the avg thermals for this CPU idling in the bios, considering all fans and everything else was running properly. I shut down the computer, checked everything, decided to start it back up and check bios and settings, everything was as it should be, so I decided to install windows, in my process of installing windows I received a BSOD that was hardware (CPU) related, I shut down the computer, and decided to remove the CPU and inspect/reapply thermal paste, this is where I began to notice issues with the processor.Upon the removal of the processor, and cleaning the thermal paste, I noticed thermal paste was trapped between the chips lid and the chips board, upon further inspection I noticed the epoxy used to attach the lid to the board was very shotty and off(pictures included) the epoxy is not even with the lid/chipboard and the chips lid is not flush with the chips board as it is with any other proc. Now I am under the assumption that the proc I received was a refurbished being sold as ""New"". While taking pictures is when I noticed the edges of the proc look as they have wear and tear and looked damaged, after making note of this my friend and I have done research and found that other people were receiving(not just AMD but also Intel products) refurbished products that were being sold as new, or incorrect products or no products at all, this is highly unacceptable. I am under the belief that I received a product sold to me ""new"" when in reality it was a delided/refurbished product. I am writing this review to warn others of what seems to be amazons shady practices and to be careful, inspect your products ASAP and be prepared to return the product.I initially am requesting a full refund, I do not want to return this product and to be shipped another from amazon, I will risk the current pandemic to go to micro center, with my story mind you, to buy one that is 100% not false advertised. If Amazon wants to tug me around and play hide and seek support, I will be forced to chargeback, although luckily amazon is very good as refunds so I  expect not to have any issues with returning this product and getting my money back.

It did not work with XMP enabled, as predicted by the motherboard specs. But it worked fine at 2933 and 1.35V with all 4 slots filled, so you can use any DDR4 3000 MHz with it in all 4 slots. DDR4 3200 CL14 worked well with XMP enabled with 2 slots occupied. But for my project I absolutely needed 128 GB of RAM, so I bought the fastest available 4x32GB RAM for just $620 from Amazon (it is available at Corsair Web site at $610), and it works flawlessly with XMP enabled, at 1.2 V (and I don't want to overclock).With 3200 CL14 RAM my system scored 12650 under Geekbench 5 on Ubuntu 18.04 (and about 11850 with 2666 CL16 RAM).So now I have a ridiculously powerful computer that cost me only about $1500.

  Great CPU.  Upgraded from a i5 4590.  Obviously there is a huge difference there. Initial testing and use of the CPU showed promising performance.However, there are issues:The CPU worked great for about 3 weeks, before I started having issues waking from S-3 and POSTing.The POST issue was traced to the MCC. What I found is that it would fail POST @ anything higher than 2400MHz, regardless of RAM modules installed.  I was running 3733 stable for weeks with no issue. Rebooted one day and it failed POST. Tried all 4 sticks individually to POST anything about 2400Mhz.As other reviewers have reported, the temperatures do run quite hot at times. I am not overclocking. Using the stock cooler, temps would go as high as 70c while gaming for extended periods. Prime95 showed 80c @ 1hr.  Idle can be anywhere from 30-40c. I did not invest in aftermarket coolers or AIO due to reviews showing negligible differences in temps.Between the wonky boost clock settings and the high temps, I'm not sure if this made the MCC fail on the CPU.Received the replacement today and the device now operates as intended both with S-3 and RAM.I generally favor AMD over Intel. Loved the 8350 as it was stable at 4.9Ghz for 5 years before failing.My advice, wait until there is another revision to this CPU.  I'm concerned that this CPU may give me issues in the future. I know someone who bought the 3800x and had very similar issues, there are also other reviews reporting likewise occurrences.UPDATE 4/3:Received replacement CPU.  Worked for about a week and then refused to POST again.  The issue occurred again where the RAM would fail POST.I tried:A different motherboard (Gigabyte AORUS)Different RAM modules rated for 2400The one time I got it to boot memtest showed no errors on the 3733.Different RAM kit @ 2133Different PSUReset CMOS on both boardsBIOS was fully up to date on both.This CPU is trash. 2 bad CPUs in a row? I’ve been buying AMD for years.As previously stated, I know someone who had a similar experience with the 3800X. Did two RMAs before refunding.Returning this and getting an i9.

Awesome Processor!  Note for Early Adopters on Temps/Voltages
","

  The new Ryzen 3000 series chips are amazing.  I was looking to replace my aging Haswell (4th Gen) Intel Core i7 4790k with something more modern - and when I read about the new Ryzen 3000 series, I waited an extra 6 months to re-build my PC...and boy am I glad I did!  I cut encoding times for a 1080p 2 hour movie from 2 hours (near real-time) to < 30 minutes!!  And through the power of the PCI-e 4.0 that this enables (when paired with an X570 motherboard), my storage access is now running at 5GB/sec write and read (with a PCI-e 4.0 enables NVMe SSD).  Everything is blazing fast even when I have a ton of stuff running.  If you’re looking for the ultimate chip for content creation, coding, and a very good option for gaming also (even if it gives up a few FPS to the highest end intel chips), look no further!!  And it even comes with a passable cooler (if you don’t mind a bit of noise and don’t plan to overclock) with nice RGB LEDs built in.Quick note for early adopters with first generation X570 boards - several boards (mine included) want to give this chip more power than is really needed.  On stock BIOS settings (with automatic voltages), it was providing upwards of 1.5v under load, which would cause the chip to get towards or above 80C, even with a high-end AIO water-cooling system.I put in a manual voltage offset of -0.20 so it doesn’t go above about 1.3V - at that voltage, it performs wonderfully and even under sustained 100% load it never goes above 69C.  I gave up a few points in high end benchmarking but in real world loads (even encoding), it’s comparable performance and should improve longevity.

  The advertised game bundle is apparently only for Windows users as they require a use of a verification tool that only works on that OS. Neither Firefox or Chrome with hardware acceleration or running in WINE in a Linux OS worked. I attempted contacting them more than once explaining my use case that I was going to use the chip in a Proxmox environment with a Windows VM and was willing to verify my hardware from any kind of Linux command or providing pictures or physical evidence but was basically told to suck a lemon you need to run the software from a Windows OS with the chip installed.So buyer beware AMDs Linux friendly reputation is BUNK.

  First, I have been with rog line my entire time with intel.  Since AMD made a big headline recently about the 3900x.  I built a new system with this mobo.  Very disappointed.  There's a voltage and temperature issue with this processor and immature mobo, which ramp up the fans up and down constantly due to high  idle temp is 5x to 6x.  Just open a firefox browser, temp went up to 65, then fans ramp up really loud.  Very very annoying.  I searched the web and found out that many people are and having the same issue.  Suggested lower the cpu voltage from bios, which I did.  Also used AMD power balance.  Anyway, returning these.  Can't deal with this right now.  I hope this will be a fix soon.

  I upgraded from a 2nd gen i5 to this. It's a huge difference. I would go as far as to say this processor is overkill. CPU intensive games used to run my i5 to 90% cpu, now with the 3900x they run at 5%. Streaming at 4k while playing games? 20% cpu. I did a prime 95 stress test on it with the stock cooler just to make sure it'd be ok, turns out nothing I throw at this thing otherwise will even get it warm. 10/10 would recommend for anyone that wants to have an unnecessarily powerful cpu.

I paired this CPU with a Gigabyte Aorus Xtreme X570 Motherboard.Just a tip - use Ryzen Master to monitor your stats, don't use HWInfo or HWMonitor as these will cause your CPU to boost performance and request additional voltage.

  I originally had an x370 with a 1700 and it was great for the past 2 years. I upgraded to a 3900x with msi x570 meg ace. After booting up with my existing linux nvme, it has been rock solid stable and very performant. I did need  to update systemd to get the system to boot normally. Although this was quite simple by using an older arch linux iso.I don't game, however compiling software packages is significantly faster than it was on my ryzen 1700 system.

Fast - just keep updating the BIOS
","

  I really do love this processor and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  However, I also want to remind everyone that our industry (technology) is still buggy as h3ll and we punish our early adopters regularly.Less so about the processor in and of itself, but with the new AMD x570 chipset it is designed to highlight.  If you want to avoid some of the pain, then the x470 is more mature, but there remain a few processor-specific items that were patched to fix some issues.The occasional problems w/ power-save were eventually resolved and now the system (6 months later) is stable and the BIOS issues appear resolved.It is worth noting that we really have reached a point in CPU design that virtually anything you want to do can be done with a 7 year old high-end CPU.  They are rarely the bottleneck, while storage and graphics remain the primary restrictions.  Therefore, buying this CPU vs. one of its lower-end siblings can be a tough decision.I'm not unhappy with my purchase, but I think i would never have noticed if I would have been using a 3700x instead.  Spending money on SSDs or  M.2 NVMe drive to replace spinning disks is still a much better price/performance argument.For now, I will just bask in the glow of having an absolutely top-tier performing machine at a non-top-tier price.  Even if I did over-invest in my CPU speed.

All core 3,8Ghz, false advertizing; Cooler total garbage!

  I could have sworn online that they say 'boost 4,7Ghz' and that it meant 'on all cores', but I guess I was wrong.Others are complaining that it doesn't reach 4,2Ghz on all cores.Stock it goes to 3,8Ghz on all cores. That's way lower than I had anticipated.Also, from experience there's a 65W overhead on Intel CPU + motherboard/PSU combos, so 65+ 65W = 130W with CPU active on all cores.The Ryzen on on all cores is rated at 105W, but total system power measures ~260W with all cores active.That's over 150W on overhead, using the same GPU, PSU, monitor, SSD, etc...)!In other words, the AMD system uses 45Watts MORE than their rated TDP, than the Intel systemThat's not very good publicity for AMD!I can't wait to upgrade this CPU to something more efficient!This thing is garbage, compared to Intel 12nm cpus!Edit:Upon further investigation, it turns out that the stock cooler that comes with this CPU, is the reason of the poor performance, and is total garbage! The CPU isn't all to blame.The stock cooler plate, has large areas that don't touch the CPU lid (in between the heat pipes)!Under load it was thermal throttling and reducing clock speed to a mere 700MHZ on all cores!!!Serious flaw!I did find a 65W ECO setting in the BIOS, that enabled me to run all cores at 3,1Ghz on the stock cooler, about 1Ghz below it's rated speed!However, once I installed a $160 water cooling solution, the system ran at a steady 3,78-3,85Ghz at the full 105Watts (probably closer to 160W), and 3,5Ghz at 65Watts.The ECO mode is very good, once the CPU is cooled sufficiently, and still offers the same boost speeds as stock 105W, when only a few cores are active.Had I known that I needed to buy a separate water-cooling system anyway, I would probably have gone for the 2950x instead, as it raises the price by an additional $160!I would definitely recommend to replace the cooler!

  Review 6/13/2020:  I finally tried the 3900X again because for the price and the cores, it can't be beaten.  Sure the 9900K may get you a few more FPS in games, but the 3900X will just ruin the 9900X in anything with multi-core and multi-threaded applications like video encoding.  Second time around I used an Asus TUF X570 Plus board and have had ZERO issues.  Thing posted immediately with no messing around.  I was able to turn on DOCP in the AI tweaker (XMP) and my memory boosted to max clock automatically with zero issues.  I have had zero issues with posting, resuming from sleep, etc.  I am ruling my first rough go as MSI's fault for having crappy bios and support.  Would never get MSI board ever again.Original review:  I really wanted to love this processor because it was super fast at video processing and encoding.  However the lack of stability and constant boot/post issues was a deal breaker for me and I finally had to get rid of it after months of messing around with it.  I had tried multiple mother boards, recommended memory sets, different gpus, psus, everything, and it still had random post issues.

  Pros: Great processor that flexibility adapts to different types of work: excellent single core and leading multi-core performance for a very competitive price. Probably among the best out there today, all things considered.Cons: the “4.6 ghz Max Boost” is misleading in the absolute best of circumstances & more accurately described as a lie. Expect ~4.2x on all core under heaviest load, with 4.3-4.4 possible fairly steady on several cores, and split-second excursions to 4.5 on a single core during single-thread heavy tasks.

I couldn't even get a cooler for it at the time and had to make it work using electrical tape and twist ties! That said, I loved my 1600X and I'm upgrading but I'll keep the CPU for a secondary rig to trade my wife up to and finally retire my Phenom II rig from so long ago.Thankfully, with a few bios updates, the 3900X and all other 3rd gen Ryzens are supported on the X370-Pro, so I have a great upgrade path to improve my rig with a 3rd gen CPU. I did this days ago, and I must say, the 3900X is a beast! The higher clock speed is noticeable, and I benefit greatly from the doubled core count. The CPU is a little pricey, I know, but the way I figured it, I know I want this level of performance eventually, so why wait and then spend even more money a few months from now? You optionally can go the 3600X route for a 6-core alternative with a very similar performance increase per-core, and you'd save about half your money, so it's a great value. However, if you multitask a lot like me, you'll benefit greatly by extra cores. The 3800X is an 8-core solution I can also recommend, but the 3900X is definitely worth the extra funds if you can spare them. It all depends on what you're planning to get out of it.Update on June 15th, 2020: Nearly 2 months after installation, no problems with the CPU, some stuttering audio (especially with Halo Reach) but that was an issue before this CPU and I have yet to find the cause or a workaround. The CPU upgrade reduced the stutter a tiny but noticeable amount.

It's a beast, and still can be had for retail price, believe it or not

  Overkill for what I do, but coming from a 2700x it's a noticeable improvement.Was able to snag this from Amazon 3 days ago for $499 before it sold out.  For those still trying to get thier hands on this thing without paying tons over retail, check Bestbuy, they seemed to get a few the middle of the week, almost pulled the trigger on another one for $499 for a friend from Bestbuy last week too.  Or maybe just wait for the 3950x?

  Coming from a Core™ i7-6700K system I built in late 2017, which has been super fast and reliable, I realized I needed more performance for editing and exporting 4K footage of my church's sermons, which at the least are 25 minutes long, and at the most, an hour. Having read about AMD's impressive comeback with the Ryzen processors, I decided to go with the Ryzen™ 9 3900X. This is my first AMD build, so I was very excited for it.The CPU arrived yesterday, earlier than expected, so I stripped my case of the Intel setup and installed the new components. I pressed the power button and the system POSTed quickly and loaded Windows 10 normally as if it wasn't a new PC.After checking things out and playing Project CARS and Dirt Rally 2.0 for a bit, everything worked smoothly, so I re-installed Windows 10 on a 1TB CORSAIR Force MP600 to start fresh. I used the product key from a new Windows 7 Pro CD I previously purchased, and Microsoft activated it when I got the system online.I tested the system on UserBenchmark and had to disable PBO, since the chip I got totally dislikes any kind of overclocking and performs worse, yielding lower scores. AMD's Robert Hallock wasn't lying when he said, “The other goal of our engineering effort is to absolutely maximise the performance of the product out of the box”.These chips come from the factory giving their all. As soon as I disabled PBO, the system scored 128% Gaming, 185% Desktop and 169% Workstation. That's 93rd overall PC percentile as of today with everything running stock.I decided against getting the highest model of motherboard and went with the lowest, just to test the waters. Having enjoyed a good experience with my other system's Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming 7, I opted for the lowly Gigabyte GA-X570-UD for this one. It lacks any bells and whistles, but has been working flawlessly since yesterday night.It boots fast and hasn't had any glitches or crashes. If you're interested in the other components of the system, I opted for fast G.SKILL Ripjaws V memory (F4-3600C16D-16GVK), and reused the other setup's EVGA RTX 2080 Hybrid (08G-P4-2184-KR) and EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G2 power supply.I HIGHLY recommend the 3900X for heavy workloads. While rendering 4K video with DaVinci Resolve 16, I ran UserBenchmark as a joke and scored 91% Gaming, 101% Desktop, and 112% Workstation, and the system never felt any different. That was with 80% background CPU load and 6.7GB free of 16GB memory.What a beast, guys! WHAT A BEAST!!! This CPU is very powerful in stock form. I'm super happy with it and am considering stepping up to the 3950X later this year when the prices go down a bit, and building a music production system with this 3900X, as I've been fiddling with computer audio for 18 years.Thanks for reading and GOD BLESS YOU!

  This thing is a beast. 12/24 is enough to stream + game without any hit on either one of those performances.However...The temps on this thing is nuts. The stock cooler kept temps at 40~ C at idle and dipped into the low 80's at 100% load. The only reason why I swapped it out, with a Dark Pro 4, is because the stock fan gets super loud. It will spool up and then wind down.Also, when you get this CPU reinstall/install Ryzen Master. It will tell you temps and it allows you to modify the CPU's settings via Manual mode. It will also tell you what Volts that your 3900x is running at. Mine came running at 1.325 out of the box. If you watch reviews, the ideal Volts is actually 1.2 or 1.25, without suffering a performance loss. This CPU actually comes with waaaay too many Volts out the box which is the culprit for its unusually high temps.When I got my Dark Pro 4, I was still idling at 60~ C. I then cut my volts to 1.2249 and my idle temps are now 38 C to 40 C. I still get my desired speeds and I'm now 20 C cooler. Under 99% load, I peak at 63 C. Under normal gaming(144/120 FPS @ 1080 + high/ultra settings) + streaming, I stay under 60 C. This means that the stock fan can definitely handle this CPU as long as you make sure to put the volts at 1.2, or 1.25, or somewhere in between that.Notes:- My build is a 2080 Super + 3900x + 850 watt PSU + Gigabyte b450 M AORUS + Corsair 16 GB RAM @ 3k MHZ + 2 SSD's- If you can handle the loudness of the stock fan(I would reduce Volts first and then see how loud the stock fan gets before upgrading) then I would keep it because it's capable of cooling this 3900x and you get RGB's- I definitely recommend downloading Ryzen Master and cutting your Volts to 1.2/1.25 or a number in between that- You don't need AIO/water cooled but just a beefy regular air cooler, I recommend Dark Pro 4(Noctua U12S is basically the same thing). Unless you want to overclock/OC, there's no need for water cooled(I personally think stock speeds is plenty)- Make sure to verify that your Motherboard is compatible with the 3000 series of Ryzen. My MOBO was on F5, which is about 10 updates behind, and had to reinstall my previous CPU to update my BIOS

  Software developer here. Running 4.30 all-core 24/7 overclock at 1.250V. I wouldn't believe this myself if it weren't my own review, so posted CPU-Z screenshot. Easily gets 7,656 on Cinebench20 with max temp of 59 C (yes really) with custom watercooling loop using 45mm XSPC RX360.  I have no idea what AMD did or how this works (PBO is magic), but I couldn't be happier.Everything I do (compiling C++ code, virtualizations, big compression jobs, playing KSP, etc) is just stupidly fast. Running Windows 7 x64 no problem (see screenshot proof; this was critical for me and my dream came true). My PC is even themed Ryzen copper/orange.  :)I wasn't ready for how amazing this product would be. I embarrassingly sound like a fanboy but this CPU is really that good. I've never had a performance jump this big. Absolutely a must-have purchase if you care at all about serious productivity.

This monster processor is great for everything

  This is the best processor I've ever owned.  I thought the Ryzen 2700x was amazing until I dropped this beast into my rig.  I had to update the BIOS on my motherboard to make this chip work in it.Gaming is good on this processor, slightly better than the 2700x.  however the most benefit comes from doing other stuff on the computer.  video editing, 3D modeling in blender, rendering, and audio editing/processing.  this processor shreds through those typically more intensive tasks like it's nothing.it gets a little warmer than the 2700x did.  i have a deepcool Castle 240EX AIO cooler in my rig.  it would usually keep the 2700x at about 65°C when gaming (20%-30% load) but the 3900x runs around 70°C when gaming (20%-25% load)another nice thing about the 3900x is that it can handle running 64gb of RAM at 3200mhz very easily, where i had trouble running the same 64gb of RAM above 2700mhz on the 2700x.  overclocking RAM and bumping up the 3900x's Fabric Clock in the BIOS to half the speed of the RAM significantly boosts the performance of this processor.

  So I decided to build a high end rig.  Bought r9 3900x, Asus prime pro x570, 32gb trident Z neo. Rog 2070 super.  Put it all together, loaded windows did my updates etc.  Performed a few bench's with stock settings and wow.  This thing was great.  Played any game I threw at it max settings 1080p throwing tons of frames basically maxing out my 144hz monitor.  Then one day about a week after building surfing the web watching YouTube on my second monitor and it glitched out hard! Bsod! Unable to boot after crash. Swapped nvme and tried to fresh install windows 10. No luck, swapped memory, graphics card, power supply, no luck.  PC specialist looked it over and said motherboard toasted.  Ordered new MSI x570 carbon.  Rebuilt the entire rig. Still Would not boot or allow fresh install of windows.  Finally last component left was CPU.  Swapped my r5 1600x from wife's PC and computer booted up and worked fine.  Searched web and found a few reports of others having exact same/very similar issue with the 3900x.  Don't know if Mobo took out CPU or other way around but returned to Amazon and replacement is on the way.  I sincerely hope the next one works as it should, because when it worked... Wow!

  The processor itself seems fine. I haven't had it long enough to tell, but the user-benchmark score is great. The issue is that I bought this expecting a promotional game-bundle as was advertised at the time of purchase, but it took weeks of working with the retailer to get the advertised deal. Be careful if advertised deals and be sure to contact the retailer before purchase of some deal was the selling point for you.

  Whatched a lot of Gamers Nexus before hand. Used AMD as my first build all the way and came to learn, they have become incredibly reliable with their hardware.Just recently upgraded from a Ryzen 5 2600X. This beast is more than twice that chip and landed on very good silicone. Occasionally I would bench test and monitor with Ryzen Master. A few cores would have me convinced were dead and the next day, everything can hit 4.4 Mhz like no problem. Spent a week trying to learn about that gibberish, but really, just XMP all the way. GN makes a lot of sense so start with them before tampering.On top of the coolant, the benching would have peak to 76, but we're talking miliseconds. Average about 68 after an hr when I'm really trying to stress it and ambient temp in house would be 30 mostly. For the avg game, it peaks about 68. Asseto Corza, Far Cry, Tomb Raider, you get the drift. 4% utilization avg.

My first AMD Processor
","

  This is my first AMD processor ever, and it's a good one. I had to switch for this build because of how much the gap has closed for gaming, and how good Ryzen has been for multi-core processing. AMD's really been putting the pressure on Intel, and this shows it. This was also the easiest processor I've overclocked using AMD's Ryzen Master software. You can do it all from within windows and after you apply your settings, you can just exit and it will retain your overclock freeing up even more resources (I think if you were to leave Ryzen Master open, it takes up like 10% processing power or something). If you're considering this processor, just make sure to get a good cooler. I'm using an NZXT Kraken x72 and, while gaming, my temps always stay right around 50C - 60C depending on how much the game utilizes the CPU. When benchmarking the highest they've gotten is 76C. So that's a solid choice for an AIO. I haven't used air cooling in years, but most people I see say that Noctua is the way to go. Overall, this is an extremely good processor and I highly recommend going with it if you're on the fence for your next build.

Fantastic for 4K video editing PC

  12 cores, 24 threads. Adobe Premiere loves it! I get near real-time max-quality rendering of 4K30 video with moderate amount of overlays, effects, and transitions in Premiere. CPU is more important than GPU in this case, and I am glad I can give it 12 cores to work on that. I have yet to test it with 4K60 video, but I imagine it will be twice as long. In either case, much MUCH faster than I'm used to in any video rendering scenario I've seen.When used with Folding@home, I can get through a CPU work unit in 25 minutes. Pretty darn good for early 2020.Included air-cooler is flashy with RGB, and very cool. I liked it so much I returned the AIO water cooler I got. Slightly overclocked to 4GHz. While doing both CPU and GPU folding@home running full power, 100% CPU usage (and 100% GPU usage contributing to the case's internal air heat), the included fan was able to keep the CPU stable at around 83°C (limit where it starts throttling is 95°C).

Getting the board ready and the drivers working is a hassle.Note* for upgrading on x470, update bios (common sense), but also update all utilities, update Lan/ wifi/ Blue tooth driver (download them from your mb maker website, then force update them through device manager.) After this, go into your bios and remove all OC's you have on the cpu and ram. Next install your 3900x and everything should boot fine. If not you'll receive a BSOD titled Bugcode_ndis_driver. That means your Lan/wifi/bluetooth drivers didnt update correctly and you'll have to back track all steps, and most importantly redownload and force install the Lan/Wifi/Bluetooth drivers driver downloads.Over all this cpu is a amazing, and I recommend getting an X570 and save the hassle of updating the x470 boards.

  Purchased on a steal for about $380 + tax when Amazon was running a deal for $50 off. This CPU is just amazing. There's really no other way to put it. Make sure you pair it with a nice X570 (or atleast X470) motherboard. Definitely need after market cooling for it, I suggest a Noctua, but watercooling AIO would also work well. This thing runs a cinebench R20 of 7100 stock out of the box! That's just amazing! Working with overclocking RAM and improving performance, I've pulled my score up to ~7250. So depending on your purposes for the CPU and if you're going to be overclocking things, you can definitely pull more performance out of it, but it's really not necessary. Just make sure you set up this beast of a CPU with a nice motherboard, RAM, PSU, and GPU.

Works perfect with a B450 motherboard and 3600MHz C16 memory

  As a typical PC gaming enthusiast, I am slowly upgrading my system as new components become available (and affordable for me).  If you are reading this, you are probably thinking of components that will work without any problems, or maybe you are thinking of upgrading your system and not sure if things will work flawlessly.  So below is my before and after setup.BEFORE:- Ryzen 7 2700X- 32GB (2X 16GB) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200MHz C 16-18-18-36- MSI B450I Gaming Plus AC- MSI Geforce RTX 2080 Ventus OC- No overclock, cpu and memory running at rated speeds with XMP enabledAFTER:- Ryzen 9 3900X- 32GB (2X 16GB) G.Skill Trident Z Neo Series 3600MHz C 16-19-19-39- MSI B450I Gaming Plus AC- MSI Geforce RTX 2080 Ventus OC- No overclock, cpu and memory running at rated speeds with XMP enabledAs you can see above, I upgraded CPU and memory.  But in my testing, I upgraded the CPU first and ran it for a couple of days before upgrading the memory.  The Ryzen 9 works fine with a 3200MHz Corsair memory at the rated timings with XMP enabled.  I did a stress test a couple of times, and didn't experience any crashes.  After a couple of days of stable run, I decided to upgrade the memory.  Since I was running a B450 motherboard, I decided to try to manually set the timings at the rated speeds, but this process produced a lot of crashes.  Finally I figured to let it run in auto settings but with XMP enabled, and that fixed the issue.  My Ryzen 9 is running with a 3600MHz memory with C16 on a B450 motherboard.  I attached a picture of the Cinebench R20 score if you're interested.So far, I am very impressed with this processor.  Installation and configuration was almost auto in the BIOS, and it just works fine.  I am planning on getting a B550 or X570 motherboard later on to get a little more headroom for overcloking.  AMD for the win.  You can't go wrong with this one.

A Powerhouse Perfect for a Home Server

  Despite the 3950X being superior and also being a good value for what you get, this ultimately was the better option for me since it was cheaper.  And I was lucky enough to find it for $499 when it was in stock.I have this installed in a Supermicro 4U rack mounted case with the ASRock X570 Pro4 motherboard.  I'm also just using the stock cooler for the CPU right now.  I thought it might be a little choked for air since the top of the cooler is pretty close to the top panel of the case.  However, there's also San Ace server fans in there keeping the air flow going.  The CPU usually ranges from 40C-50C when idle.  I have the fans ramp up more at 60C, and this seems to keep it under control when under load.I use this CPU to run a Plex server and a Linux VM performing various tasks.  The Linux VM has 8 cores assigned to it, and I have Plex transcoding set to the max quality.  Transcoding even a 45-minute episode in 1080p at those higher settings is done within 30 seconds.  All while performing the other tasks.  It's really incredible how powerful this CPU is.  It also helps I came from using an old Intel Q6600 quad core for years as the server CPU.  That CPU was a trooper (leftover from a 2007 gaming rig), but it was definitely time to retire it.It's probably somewhat overkill for what I need, but I'm planning on using this for the foreseeable future as the server CPU.  I think it is quite up to the task!  If $750 is a bit much to ask for the 3950X, or finding it in stock at all is difficult, I can't recommend the 3900X enough as a great alternative.  You won't be disappointed!

  This is a great processor! I had the ryzen 5 1600 when it launched initially. I was very impressed with that processor and it served me well and it was still working up to the time i changed to the ryzen 9.I used the stock cooler for about 3 weeks and had idle temperatures early mornings when it was cool from 36-40 degrees Celsius. When i initially installed the processor it was idling in the 50's and random spikes to the 60's. I see many people complaining of this high temp issue. Please ensure Core Performance Boost is OFF in your BIOS. For some reason manufacturers leave have this on by default and XMP Profile off by default. Pretty dumb in my opinion.If i leave Core Performance Boost on and run a cinebench test the temperatures go into the 80'sStock at 3.8ghz it goes to 65-70.I ended up putting in a Noctua NH-D15 cooler and while idle temps stayed around the same when those big fans ramp up the temperature is more controlled. This was just for testing. I keep CPB off all the time. Mind you my case is very old and has no fans in front or the top. I just have one side open.Some takeaways:1) Your processor temperature can be high if Core Performance Boost is ON - Turn this off!2) Have proper airflow and you should be fine with your stock cooler3) Make sure your bios is updated as there have been issues with voltages on the 3000 series processors4) Run after market coolers AIO or Noctua etc.5) CPU temperature is also affected by your ambient temperatures.6) If you do get the 3900 or the 3950x and you dont always need the latest or greatest you will be fine for many years to come.

3900x Do it all cpu for $500

  I wanted to start out by saying I have been anticipating this cpu for a while and patiently waiting and AMD has made me a believer.Switched from a 5820k after being all about Intel to a 2700x thinking AMD would deliver in the near future. Well they have.I'm getting same temps as my 2700x with better performance at 1080p with higher minimums and average frames with my 1080ti.I haven't tried to overclock because honestly you're better off letting the processor do it's thing but I will try to see what I max out at on all cores eventually.I'm using the x470 taichi with 3.50 bios and AMD just released beta chipset drivers which fixed the idle vcore issue at least for me. Max temps with pbo off is around 73c. PBO on I can hit 80c easily with noctua nh-d15 but thats usually in cinebench. This motherboards seems to handle this processor with no issues. Vrm temps max out at 48c.Max boost I hit is 4575MHz but while gaming I usually sit around 4275 with occasional boost up to 4500MHz. Games also seem to run smoother on AMD Ryzen Cpu's compared to Intel's offerings.I honestly didn't need a 12 core cpu but I wanted a processor that can last me a few years especially with the new consoles using 8 cores more games will make use of the 12 cores.Also I'm able to run my ram at 3600 cl16 with the xmp profile. Could not do that on the 2700x which maxed out at 3400 cl14.I got tired of waiting for stock so I ordered on Amazon and I did have to wait and even at one point I thought I wouldn't receive it on the estimated delivery day but night before it was shipped out and here the next day. Had to wait a week though because inventory seems to be low but it was worth the wait.You can't go wrong with this processor just make sure you have latest bios before installing the cpu.If money is tight I'm sure the 3700x and 3800x would be just fine.

Has CPU Temperature Based Fans Constantly Cycling
","

  The Tctl temperature that motherboards use as a proxy for CPU temperature on this chip is a raw value with no moving average applied.  So at idle at least every 10 seconds it will jump 10 to 15 degrees C (18-27 F) for a split second before dropping back down to the CCD 1 & 2 die temperatures.  That sets the included Wraith Prism off toward full RPM with a loud roar.  Of course, before the CPU fan even has a chance to significantly increase speed the temperature has dropped back down.  But the fan won't know that until the next temperature reading so the fan continues loudly toward full max RPM.  A few seconds later the fan drops its speed back down, only to have the cycle repeated about 10 seconds later.  Really ANNOYING.No boost in fan speed is going to have an effect within a few seconds!!!  So why not use a moving average so that fan speeds only increase for loads that are going to last at least several seconds???  Yes, you can play with your fan curves so that the speed doesn't change over huge temperature ranges, but then your fans are either operating faster (louder) than necessary all the time or your chip is running hotter than necessary because you don't speed up the fans at all when the CPU temperature rises 15 degrees (27F).

  Okay, I built a Rig about a year ago utilizing very good and premium parts. At the time, the Ryzen 2700x was the CPU to get and arguably the fastest AMD product. Also, the nVidia 2000 line of video cards was not out yet (Wouldn't you know it? A couple of months after I built it, the 2000 line came out. I hate it when that happens!).At any rate, since my Rig is still relatively newer, I bit the bullet and upgraded both my CPU and nVidia card. I settled on this chip plus the 2800ti in late September. Boy, what a huge upgrade! Seriously. It took me no time to install both parts, and I didn't run into any problems. I can't believe how much faster the 3900x is over the 2700x. I was surprised given that just a year went by. I was expecting an incremental speed boost, but what I got was much more substantive. The 24 threads this thing produces makes multitasking a cinch! Seriously. You can have many programs and services running and this thing barely flinches!As I mentioned, I paid top dollar for an Asus RTX 2080ti at the same time I got this CPU. The combination of both parts is seamless and huge in performance. I have no bottleneck. I can play any game at max settings and it is buttery smooth.I am not sure what else to say other than to get it! Personally, I wouldn't wait for the 3950x. I mean 16 cores is great and all, but there won't be a huge difference in real world speed performance. The 16 cores would come in handy for video processing and editing, but I haven't read many reviews that show the 3950x spanking the 3900x in gaming performance. I just didn't see the need to hold out for this CPU. Personally, I am very happy with the 3900x and I say get it!

Great CPU if Productivity is your Focus

  This CPU is phenomenal if you're doing more than gaming. I'm able to run Docker containers very well with this CPU and many more concurrent instances of them. It also runs games as well as any current Ryzen 3000 processor, though if you're only gaming then this processor is a bit overkill.The included box cooler is able to cool this CPU at stock settings well enough even under all core workload that synthetically stresses the CPU. A decent aftermarket aircooler however is probably a good investment (or an AIO if you're into that). I was able to reuse an existing Gammaxx 400v2 from a previous build and that performed well enough at stock settings (though only marginally better than the included box cooler). Using that CPU cooler, under full all core workload looping Cinebench R20 for over 20 mins, it hit a peak temperature of 81.8 degrees Celsius about 8 mins in before leveling out around the 80 degree mark for the duration of the test. The included box cooler should be similar to those results, albeit with slightly higher temps.In all, I really like this processor. It is very well rounded and as I increase my personal development projects using Docker containers, I can definitely make use of the additional cores. With Ryzen 5000 series coming out later this year be on the lookout for great deals on these. I was able to get this one for $409 w/ Amazon 5 month payments, which made this an easy buy for me.

Very fast and not very expensive
","

  I bought this to replace an AMD Ryzen 2700x which was a pretty fast chip. But this 3900x is on another level, I immediately noticed my system running snappier, apps installing faster, and apps opening faster. I am very happy with the upgrade and for $500 a 12 core, 24 thread CPU is a heck of a bargain. A chip like this just a few years ago would've ran over $1000 easy.I can confirm that the 3900x runs perfectly fine on a X470 chipset after doing BIOs updates. If you are already running a X470 system and are thinking of upgrading your CPU, you do not need to upgrade to the X570 board for it to work. Though one piece of advice I'd give after my experience would be to also update your drivers in Windows before installing this CPU. I had some issues with the LAN and WIFI drivers for my board in Windows after installing the CPU. Though updating all my chipset drivers to the latest versions fixed all the issues.

A monster processor

  I am not a gamer, so fps and overclocking are not concerns for me.I've built my PC to last me several years, so I've used very fast components of good quality.After doing my research, I decided to go with Ryzen over a Core i7/i9 for the following reasons:1) Lower power consumption (the i9 is a beast in terms of power)2) Faster multithreading, which I believe will only get more important with time3) Overall better performance, cheaper than the i9, and close to the i7I've used the included fan and it works well for me. I've installed this on as ASUS x5700 TUF Gamer Pro Wi-Fi. Installation was pretty easy and I have had no issues whatsoever. In terms of compatibility, everything works perfect. The only gripe I have is that I was thinking of doing a hackintosh on a spare hard drive, but it seems to be a lot harder and less stable with Ryzen because Apple does not support it. If that was my main goal, I would have gone with an Intel chip.If you liked my review, please click the helpful button below.

  This CPU has may DAW running like a champ, lowers video rendering time from 8 to 5 hours. My DAW sounds cleaner with half the memory (Only 4 slots on motherboard, had 8 with my old MB and i7 6800). Will increase memory with the new 32GB ram modules that just came out. But this CPU is so good, the thread monitors show less core activity than my old processor when the music was stopped and the audio engine just idling. Don't buy this CPU from the ripoff people who charge more than $499. Pre-order it and you may get it within the next two weeks. It may take about two months to make a new batch of these 7nm chips.

This CPU has turned me from Team Blue to Team Red
","

  I was recently building a new system to replace my decade old system that had developed stability issues with Windows 10, but was still a solid workstation.  I had been happy with the Intel CPU that was in that system, so was initially looking at Intel CPUs when I started to see the reviews for the 3900X and, how, dollar for dollar, it was a better CPU for the same price as lower spec'ed Intel CPUs.  For example, I was originally looking at an i9-9900 with only 8 cores / 16 threads which, at the time, had a higher sticker price.Having been around in the days of the early AMD processors, like the K5 and K6 processors, I remembered the thermal and performance issues of some of those early models.  I had been impressed when the Athlon came out, but for a long time, AMD had lagged Intel.  But with these 3rd Gen Ryzen CPUs, it appeared that was no longer the case and I decided to take a gamble and try them out.And boy have I been happy.  This processor has converted me over from Team Blue (Intel) to Team Red (AMD).

Great for gaming at 1440p while streaming at 720p60

  Context: I came from an i7-6700k and my main game is rainbow 6 Siege and I was hitting 95% cpu usage while playing the game at 1440p with low/medium textures. Streaming was entirely out of the question as well since my 1080TI was up at like 70% as well, unfortunately.Enter 3900X: same settings, I'm at ~25% cpu usage, and with my current settings I locked my frames to 141FPS and I get 140FPS lows with 141.5FPS highs. Buttery smooth even while streaming the game at 720p60 on Twitch.paired with the ASRock Phantom Gaming X motherboard, I just plugged all of the parts into the MOBO, turned it on, and the stream that I was watching came right up as I booted into windows.on the original bios for the motherboard, I was able to get to 4.65Ghz on several individual cores but with recent updates I'm down to 4.375-4.4Ghz. Hoping for a fix soon as I know the cpu can do more.Overall: Excellent CPU, probably overkill for what I really need, but this baby is exactly what you'd expect in a gaming/productivity chip!

  Forget the new ""XT"" chips. The gain is small over these. Until Zen 3 arrives this is the best bang for your buck for multi core tasks.Some Intel chips can run single core games slightly faster, but for any program that can actually utilize 24 threads this thing is a BEAST.Mine arrived quickly at a very good price and was packaged adequately. Amazon was the first with the 417 price. New Egg has since dropped three more dollars off the price but Amazon's convenience is worth $3 to me on an item of this value.

Cost for performance not quite there, even with production projects.
","

  If you’re only doing gaming, go with the Ryzen 3600 or 3700x at most. This is meant for production purposes. Also depends on the silicon lottery. My 3700x compiled a 20 minute 1080p project just about as quickly as the 3900x. For shorter music productions, it was actually faster. These results were gathered after 5 runs with the same project on both processors. More cores doesn’t necessarily mean giant leaps in performance over cost. Real world benchmarks via tech companies online had similar results also. Research before you buy. Could save you a lot of money.

   Bought mine back in the scalping days for a backstabbing price of around $750. No regrets whatsoever. I keep it cool with the Sythe Ninja 5 air cooler sits at around 50° at idle and can get up to mid to high 80°s under load. (Prime 95 records an average of 71° during the test with a max temp of 88°) I have mine clocked stably at 3.8GHz on ryzen master. Had some success with 4.1GHz but it would occasionally crash during intense scenes in games so I had to dial it back. I got a CPU score of 5,770 in Time Spy Extreme with an average simulation time per 60.ms frame.I am a multitasker with discord, Spotify, PUSH Video Wallpaper, and about 20-50 tabs constantly opened which results in about 10-30% usage. I will also often have programs like Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Word, an extra 100 tabs, and a game opened at the same time (on top of the previously listed programs) and only rarely hit 80% usage, usually hovering at around 60% with that particular workload. This thing is a beast and I'm glad I snagged it. The only time I see it get maxed out was during benchmarks and during a Premiere Pro export. As I have no real experience with Premiere Pro I won't go into any details.

False advertisement on peak clock speed

  Giving it a 4/5 only becuz this chip wont achieve 4.6 on some of the units.Dont get me wrong, 3900x is super powerful and a great cpu among the price range. I love it really much and glad that I switched from Intel to AMD platform since I do video editing work for most of the time. However, once I started fooling around the OC part, I realize geting to 4.6 is a bit different.the number 4.6 only can goes on 1 single core and for mine and a lot of other owners on varies forum, only a handful of them can get to that number. Reaching 4.3ghz on all cores are not too bad for most of us. but still, there are a lot of people peak at 4.3 and any further will cause unstablity/system crash. The out of box core voltage was set really high. mine was over 1.4 default in bios.Conlusion-OC potential kinda shallow. if you want monster gainz, you better go with Intel cpu. but this chip is already quite good.the stock cpu cooler can handle it if you dont plan on OC or any other heavy load work.REALLY FASTI am using Corsair H150 360mm AIO, kinda overkill but I really need that quiet working environment.

Amazing CPU but hard to get because of shortages
","

  If you're here I guess you saw enough reviews/benchmarks of this CPU. All I can add is my personal experience with it.I paired it up with my Asus Prime X470-Pro after flashing it with a new BIOS (5204). I didn't have to re-install OS, drivers was able to keep up automaticaly. It's still possible to get this to run with Windows 7, by the way, but it might be tricky - mainly with chipset USB ports not working properly due to a lack of drivers, but it's fixable.Current BIOS sets voltage a bit high, and that's the reason why this CPU runs hot even with Noctua NH-D15 cooler.Compared to R7 2700 it's much faster in any task, especially in encoding with a multi-thread support. Gaming performance is also better, but you probably know this already.The only downside I see with, apparently, whole 3000 series is increased memory latency, but you can still try to improve it with RAM overclocking.As for my shipping experience with UPS Russia... well, let's just say it wasn't a pleasant one. I had to pay 25$ for shipping (which is fine) and then 15$ more just for UPS fees, had to wait one more week because they are so slow and they actually gave my package to a local post service for me to pick it up personally. Which means they can't provide an ""Expedited"" shipping, so if I had an option - I would never choose UPS services ever again. Box itself was *slightly* damaged, but I'm just glad I got this CPU in one piece :)

Powerhouse

  Highly recommended. The sense of immense power is palpable. Even with multiple typical applications running, my CPU utilization rarely goes over 5%. And with highly parallel, episodic tasks such as 3D rendering, completion times are reduced by factor 20 or thereabouts. Compared to 3900X, my old Intel i7 4790 (which even in 2019 was still considered a decent CPU) now feels like an pitifully outdated '80s pocket calculator. The bundled cooler is fine to get you started (around 45 deg idle, up to 85 deg full load), but I'd recommended buying a better third-party air or water cooler so as to achieve lower CPU temperatures and lower fan noise levels.

  Every 4 years or so I build a new high-end desktop (HEDT) system. This year, with AMD's new processor lineup and motherboards (PCIe 4.0) I decided to go with AMD's Ryzen 9. I gave up waiting for the 3950x and decided to get the 3900x instead. I do a lot of Lightroom and Photoshop work, and with this processor and a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD, it is SO much faster than my last system it is mind-boggling. I don't think I'm giving up much buying a processor one step down from the 3950x as apps currently tend to not take significantly better advantage of multithreading after 12 or so physical cores. I have had absolutely NO issues with this system - everything works, runs fast, and not a single OS crash to date.  AMD says the Ryzen 9 4000 series will be out this year and still AM4-compatible, so there is an upgrade path without a socket change, unlike Intel who constantly changes the socket. I build systems for other people and I'm now recommending AMD across the board - seems like a no-brainer today, really.

  Coming from a AMD X6 1090T six core system I built 9 years ago all I can say is WOW this is ridiculously fast.

Since I don't game, I don't know if I ever will need all 12 cores. My son does and he has an Intel  I7 8600 system he built 2 years ago and is totally blown away with how fast my system is.  We're also amazed with how quiet and how cool it runs. It's also nice to see the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X at the top of Tom's Hardware CPU Hierarchy ranking. I'm using the stock cooler that came with it and when I test it using Ryzen Master or CPU-Z bench it maxes out at 4.3Ghz and never exceeds 83 degrees C on 12 Cores, using the simple Asus Prime X570 Pro motherboard overclocking utility.

From 2700X to 3900X

  Pro: The IPC improvements make this noticeably snappier than the 2700X which I didn't expect.  The clocks and boost speeds run speedier,  and this is stable with my memory at 3200MHz (the 2700X wasn't.  It's not rated for it.) When you do something that engages all 12 cores this thing is a beast.  For being to able to drop it into the same socket on the same motherboard and have it draw about the same power as the less powerful chip... AMD has pulled something off good here.Con:  There really aren't any.  It's expensive and in limited supply.  The included Wraith Prism cooler does the job but it's a little noisy.  Other coolers might get you to quieter and more boosts.  Look at the bottom of the cooler, too, it's not flat nor is there enough thermal goop to fill the ridges.  Curious.  You'll also want to get the latest motherboard BIOS installed before plugging this in.Note: Installation was simple except for some swearing when getting the old stock cooler off the board.

  AMD nailed it this time around.  The 2nd gen Ryzen chips were pretty solid for the money, but the 3rd gen leap frogs both the Zen 1 architecture and Intel.The chip is crazy fast and it is such a treat to see 12 cores / 24 threads show up in task manager. This thing plays games like a champ, transcodes super fast, and will unrar a 16gb .rar in under 10 seconds. So for playing games, it is more than sufficient... transcoding videos is a breeze... going from remux mkv to h265 is much quicker than on my 8th gen i7.I love that AMD is using AM4 still which gives you some backwards compatibility with motherboard selection but I still went with an X570 to take advantage of PCIE 4.0.

  This processor is a dream. The board was running a little more voltage than I liked, so I dialed it in a 1.3v 4.2ghz. It seems that past 4.2 it starts to want a ton more juice to bring up the clock, but YMMV. Running an air cooler (Scythe Mugen Rev B), it idles around 42c and hits 65c top when gaming. It flirted with 70 during a cinebench run, but that won't be an issue for day-to-day operation. I'm surprised how cool this chip runs despite 12 cores. For gaming, its a bit behind the 9900k, but if you do anything else it will run circles around that chip. I'd say this is a very very good option for high end gaming if price isn't an issue, but don't go for the 3950x, you won't even see 5 frames for your extra money.

  I upgraded from an aging i7-2600K system, and WOW, what a difference! AMD is back!I didn't get a replacement graphics card until a few weeks after I bought the core system, so I used my existing GTX 970 which got a roughly 15% boost in performance! Although I initially had second thoughts, I eventually replaced the 970 with a GTX 1080 Ti, and wow this rig is screaming.The chip runs fine with the included Wraith Prism, however it does get quite noisy when under a high workload. I went ahead and replaced with a DarkRock Pro 4, which not only greatly reduced the noise, but also dropped the idle temps by almost 10 degrees Celsius. There was also a ~4% performance improvement under heavy load due to being able to maintain higher clock speeds longer before thermal throttling kicked in. (Tested with Passmark)  If you do get an aftermarket heatsink, make sure and check the height of the heatsink with the maximum height supported by your case.I've been an Intel fanboy ever since the Core2Duo days up until the release of Ryzen. The last time I was this excited about an AMD processor was back when the old Slot-A AMD Athlon Thunderbird 600A chip was released back in 1999. This chip is a productivity monster and no slouch when it comes to gaming. This chip is definitely worth the money! Go team Red!

Also be sure to update to the latest AMD chipset driver, which improve temperature and voltage at idle. I have mine dropped to as low as 38C in a hot summer ambient temperature.As for performance, the cpu clock speed stays at 3.9GHz under 100% load and 4.3GHz when boosted. I have never seen the advertised 4.6GHz boost clock, maybe it will come with more driver update?

  MSI MEG x570 AceRyzen 9 x3900Radeon 5700xt32 GB 3200MHz Corsair Vengence RGBSamsung Evo M.2 DriveThis thing was running hot when I first set everything up. Looking at my HWMonitor program in windows, I saw my cpu voltages were spiking around 1.3 - 1.4 at default, non-game boost settings. I went into my BIOS and set my CPU voltage to 1.21 and my CPU is now at 3.78 GHz. I know this is underclocking, but my temps are low, my voltages stable, and it runs beautifully. Probably lost 2 FPS in games because of the under clock, but I bet my cpu lasts longer than others. I suggest doing this if your CPU voltages are all over the place and you are concerned about longevity or heat. You could always do liquid cooling and put game boost on and probably not have to worry, but it's worth the under clock if you want your system to last 10+ years like me. I've only had for 2 weeks. Will post here if I start having issues.

First time in years I bought an AMD Cpu.
","

  Purchased Ryzen 9 3900X,  a $90 Asus B450M motherboard and a Seagate SSD FireCuda and topped up with existing PSU, memory and Video Card. Watched YouTube video where I got stuck to avoid damage to the CPU. This for office use.  The assembly to using it to do work projects was quick and easy and there were no issues.The performance rivals that of my i9-9900K and my other high end e7's and Xeon e-21's / e22's . Recommended.But ….The memory score by  Passmark rating was only 2800. My Intel's get 3200 to 3400 and for my work I need this. Very one should aim for a memory score of at least 3000. I see from Passmark Scores that only a few X570 MB's  such as Meg X570 Ace get Memory scores in the 3100 to 3500 range and they are $300 mbs. As soon as possible I will replace the $90 board with one of these to raise my memory score and more comfort of use to one of these.My installation hint is to use some cheap existing memory on hand and when all else is finished then attempt more expensive memory.  I found that less expensive high-grade memory often gave better results that ultimate top end which is not the case with Intel. Only buy memory you can return .  The $90 Asus MB using the B450M chip is a bargain and while undocumented you will enjoy its overclocking tools if you are into that. At that price it is a throw away board ( or put a cheaper AMD chip on it ) to  get you started!Roe5685.

A powerhouse at this price point

  I don't have much to add over what everybody else has already said, but I've at least gotta toss in my 2 cents worth.I use this mainly for audio editing, video editing, and gaming.  It's a jack-of-all-trades kind of CPU that can do any of these tasks while barely breaking a sweat.  I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, and this thing absolutely smashes it for all of the tasks that I ask it to do.  Video transcoding and rendering are 110% faster, I get substantially better FPS in every game I've played, and of course it can do audio editing in a home recording studio with one hand tied behind its back, even with a heavy load of virtual instruments and VST effects.My main con is that it really puts out some serious heat.  I tried the included cooler, but it didn't even come close to properly cooling this CPU in my rackmount 4-space server chassis.  I ended up putting a Corsair H150i in my system and it's still barely keeping it down to acceptable heat levels.  It's not overheating any more, but it still tops out around 90C when all of the cores are at 100% utilization, and it idles in the mid to high 30's.  Maybe a chassis with better airflow would knock another 10 degrees off of those temps.

  This is one heck of a cpu. I have had installed for 3 days now and the difference is crazy. I went from my 5 year old Athlon 64 to this cpu and what a difference. I am a heavy pc user (software designer, 3D modeler (for fun)) plus my pc is the home media server. My cpu was always running above 50% all the time (so the fan was always making lots of noise). Since installing this cpu I have not seen it go above 10% even when I am pushing a bit. So I went from a lot of noise in my office to silence. I also have noticed a huge difference in load times on VR. I cannot give this cpu more praise. Also I paired it with a MSI MEG ACE x570 the build went together without a hitch.

  It was great until I tried to run the ram at rated speed 3600mhz , coupled with the infinity fabric 1800mhz(even let auto take a whack at it) like you are supposed to. It can only run stock now and I am returning for one that doesn't have bunk silicon on the infinity fabric. This isn't my first PC but my first amd processor and it was fun to have much available after updating everything but it literally pooped out on me after doing the only first easy non overclocking thing it needed to. My mobo is giving me a red light for CPU error and it will only run base speed infinity fabric uncoupled. At this point I could run a 3600x for the same gains in games and with some gentle OC get imilar performance to this thing without it's infinity fabric running right.

Best all around performance CPU on the market that is also somewhat affordable

  This CPU is absolutely the best all around consumer minded performance part on the market today as this CPU can do it all (including gaming, especially at 1440p res & up where the vid card will matter far more than the CPU but it's no slouch at 1080p res either) & do it very well but is an absolute slayer at everything else that the normal everyday consumer will do w\ their computers. The only thing that can hurt this part is it's price point....which is still very good for what you're getting but is still a little too pricey for the vast majority. I haven't had this much fun messing w\ a new upgrade part (CPU & new X570 mobo….all the rest is reused) in a LONG time! I would rate it a full 5 stars for value as well if recommending this to myself but that would be overlooking it's small price point concerns. Paired this thing up w\ a MSI AM4 X570 Gaming Plus mobo due to it's very good price point vs features loadout for a X570 mobo….hardware is rock solid...…..

A monster, by all accounts.

  I would think a processor that has 12 cores and 24 threads would be clocked pretty low and the individual cores themselves be pretty stunted.Not so.Even out of the box, untouched, no overclocking, I am getting 2x  the frame rate in every game I play that was CPU bound in a previous overclocked i7 3770k.One single thread of the 3900x renders Cinebench 71% of the speed of ALL 8 THREADS of an overclocked 3770k. The multicore score is simply 10x higher! It's weird to see 7-zip unzip an 11GB file in a few seconds. My WoW on absolute maximum settings -on the same GPU- went from 40 FPS to 90's. GTA V did roughly the same.And multitasking. I can run Prime 95 on all cores and still stream a 4k video. I converted 35 High definition shows with Handbrake WHILE PLAYING VR. This chip doesn't seem to be a champ overclocker, but using Ryzen Master, I got it to be 4.2GHZ while using a few core, such as in gaming, and to be 3.9GHZ when using all cores, and it seems to be stable.A great chip, even at this high price. Not too many people need this kind of multitasking capability, but if you render 3d models, edit video, or hugely multitask, this is a great deal.

Amazing processor
","

  AMD truly did something special by their 3000 series, especially the 3600, 3600X and 3900X.  It's quite literally so much performance for the dollar and instills so much value when using it that it's still surreal to me.  It's been a long time coming having hovered back to AMD offerings. The oldest AMD CPU's I personally used were the X2 4400+ and Phenom 1090t. Since then it's been Sandy Bridge i7 2600k and then Kaby Lake with a 7700k from there while having built PC's for friends and family using primarily the Ryzen 5 2000 and 3000 SKU's. The last CPU's admittedly that made me personally feel in my own builds that provided so much value were the formerly mentioned Intel SKU's...till I made that jump back to the 3900X. Anyone looking at a true ""all-in-one"" CPU...whether it be for your workstation or gaming are in for a treat.  This processor really does shine and although Intel is looking to put out a new product stack ""soon"", it's hard to imagine a value in hindsight being better in this price range than this particular processor.  No buyers remorse here, anyone on the fence about picking up this processor...just do it, you won't regret it.

Even though it is pretty. THE FAN IS SO LOUD!!!

  Looks freakin gorgeous. But man is it a wind turbine. I previously had the stock cooler from my Ry2700 and it was so much quieter and maintained an idle around 30c, a little over 60c while doing hard gaming relying on it (VR/2k/4k paired with a 1080ti). THIS SUCKER IDLES just under 60c. I worried I did the thermal paste wrong. Online said these temps were normal for this cpu.So since it runs so hot, and the fan is so much louder. It's wasted money, and even more money to improve the issue. There should be a heatsinkless option. I mean I can hear it running from the bedroom while it idles on the desktop. It's as loud as the fan on my resin printer 5 feet away, 2 past the pc case. Now it DOES HAVE a high and low switch. I put it on high, because why cap it's fan speed? If I want to limit it's speed, I can do that through the software. But considering it idles at or under 60c... Why would I ever want to turn down the fan speed?A new cooling option is going to be the next thing this PC gets, I'll sell this junk heatsink/hair dryer to some kid who likes flashy lights for $25-$50 prolly. Other than that... It rocks. Dude the Intel equivalent is something like 5% better, for hundreds of dollars more. Go team Ryzen! Although I was hoping for a tad bit more of a performance increase after upgrading from 7 to a 9 in a newer generation. Still love it though. I love raising the roof on this computer lol. 1080Ti hybrid cooled, and thanks to this junk heatsink, a soon to be liquid cooled CPU... if not a Noctua.

Ryzen is always the best option for gaming and workstation PCs

  So I have stuck with AMD since they released their Ryzen series CPUs. Back in the day (pre 2000 and into early 2000s) I used the Athlon processors exclusively. Eventually switched to Intel processors, and since about 2016 have stuck with AMD Ryzen exclusively. Every time I upgrade I am happy I decided to stick with them.I overclocked this Ryzen 9 3900x which I overclocked to 4.2ghz (able to go to 4.5 but haven't tested that out yet).Just as with my last Ryzen 7 2700 that was overclocked for the 1.5 years I used it it has been incredibly stable. I do not use the wraith cooler, I have a dual chamber water cooler as these CPUs run a bit hotter than the Ryzen 7 (8 core) CPUs - of course I used a water cooler with that as well due to overclocking.You could get away with the cooler and overclocking possibly but it is best just to use the water cooler just in case.The processing power is incredibly. I have it coupled with a 2080ti and 32 gigs of 3200mhz ram. I do video editing, graphics, and sound editing for work. Heavy CPU and graphics card usage in those processes and this computer runs perfectly. I would stack this against any intel chip in the same range... this one beats it in speed and price.In Ryzen Master software currently it is fluctuating between 36 degrees C, and 38.6 degrees. With my Ryzen 7 2700 which was overclocked to 4 ghz and with my other water cooler (single chamber) it was usually between 24-30 C. so we added 4 more cores, and more power per core. I have not noticed a significant increase while running games/software but the limit is 95 degrees C so it is not really something you need to worry about.I highly recommend this CPU. This is expensive when looking at CPUs like the Ryzen 7 2700x and similar, but 430 dollars or whatever it was is well worth it. My old PC (which has been rebuilt and still has a GTX 1070) is still a modern PC that is capable of a lot and this current one will be for several years really. Short of upgrading the video card to the 3090 within the next year (maybe)  I do not foresee any real need to upgrade the CPU for at least 3-4 years.As far as money goes - sometimes we need to be reminded of perspective. My fiance was getting a laptop the other day and wanted to spend 500-650 max. She is a traveling medical worker. So a laptop will be very important to her and used a lot as she goes from city to city. So I explained that we drop upwards of 1000 dollars or more on our phones every 1 to 2 years without much thought at all. yet when we are buying electronics that will need to have a lot of power and hold up and be used as much or more we get very cheap. I spent 2000 dollars on a laptop back in 2012 and have upgraded it here and there (ram and hard drive) and it still runs extremely well. I use it for a lot of things. Had I spent 500 dollars it would have been useless by now.So if you have the means, do not cheap out and buy a 300 dollar option for your CPU - you will end up spending that much or more very soon. Always buy beyond what you need when building a PC if it is doable for you. I have had systems that ran flawlessly for many years, and ones that played the latest games at high settings with decent FPS, and ran adobe software wonderfully.I will update this review when I test an OC of 4.5 ghz and give you the details on cinebench for both the 4.2 and 4.5 OC.

Defective CPU (hardware faults on multiple systems)

  I received a chip that causes hardware fault BSoDs when installed in multiple independent x570 PC systems (different motherboards, different RAM, different graphics cards from both ATI and Nvidia, different NVMe storage, power, peripherals, etc.).  Typical symptom is a Win10 ""PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA"" BSoD, occurring under lightly-loaded use.  I should point out that I do not overclock these systems...they are built for reliability.  Interestingly, the CPU I received in this order works seemingly quite reliably under highly loaded usage (uptime is weeks at least at 90+% CPU usage on nuclear transport calculations, versus hours at best when unloaded).  As I can drop this chip into multiple systems with virgin Win10 Pro OS and get the same result, the issue is conclusively linked to the CPU I received in this order.  Not really an acceptable defect in a brand-new, top-of-the-line processor.  I will be spending an additional $400 to replace it.

  After buying this I realize I would have been fine with a Ryzen 7 3700X or 3800X. Great CPU but not worth the extra money in my case. My advice is that if you don't have the extra cash to burn do a bit more reading on this. The single-thread performance of this CPU is slightly inferior to the 3700X and the extra cores are only worth it if you have a real need for it.For some context, I am a software engineer currently getting my MS in CS and taking data science courses. I use my PC for studying and gaming. The reason I bout the 3900X instead of the 3700X or 3800X is because I thought the price difference was worth it, especially compared to other similar Intel CPUs. The CPU is usually running at 1-2%, sometimes it goes up to a ludicrous 9%--we are talking with Outlook, Chrome (several open tabs), VPN client, CMD, File Explorer, MS Word, and that's just a few of the GUI apps that were opened, not to mention the overall hundreds of processes and nearly 4K threads. Of course, those are not the most demanding apps, so that doesn't say much of heavier loads, but this should give you an idea of how powerful this thing is. If you need a great gaming PC just stick to Ryzen 5 or 7. If you need to run heavy applications that take advantage of multiple cores or you want to seriously future-proof your machine for the next 3-4 years and beyond, then get this.

  This CPU is an absolute beast, particularly at this price point. I used this chip for my new gaming rig, paired with an ASUS X570 Prime Pro motherboard and a RTX 2080 Ti GPU. A cooler is included but I went with a be quiet! cooler instead of the stock cooler in the hopes of getting more efficient cooling. I haven't bothered overclocking as the performance is perfectly adequate as-is. Temperatures in my air-cooled setup rarely get above 50C even under non-synthetic loads. Note that while a cooler is included, thermal paste is pre-applied to the cooling plate on the cooler, so you will need to buy your own thermal paste (I assume that anyone looking at using this CPU for their build would know this, but a heads up for those who might be expecting to get some ""free"" paste since a cooler is included).An awesome value compared to its Intel competitors!

  I upgraded from a 1700x which was 3 times faster than the previous fx8350 cpu, this cpu compared to the 1700x is like having 4 cpu's on the same board.  this thing is so crazy fast. paired with the msi meg ace board and gskill trident z neo 3600 ram.  it overclocks beautifully. there is really no temp difference from base 3.8 clock to 4.4ghz clock, very lil. it idles at 34c using thermal grizzly cpu paste and a thermal take floe 360.  overclocked using the msi board button on switch setting 11 is 4.4ghz and the cpu idles at 38c and under full load I haven't seen it go over 50c. im very happy with this cpu. I get a single thread score of 545 in cpuz benchmark and 8659 under multi thread score. my 1700x score 485 single and 4230 in multi threaded score. this thing is a beast.  anyone who doubts this cpu because its not an intel is only fooling themselves. amd may be a lil slower in gaming out of the box but once they overclock they become faster than the competition intel. iver owned both intel and amd and the end result seems to always be the same.  amd cpus are just better.

Fast, but overheats with default settings & has poor driver support

  When I first installed this, it immediately started overheating. It is on a new 570 MB that supposedly supports Ryzen Gen3. After much angst, I found this is a common problem if you don't have the correct setup, i.e. drivers and power management settings. ""Out of the box"" is not an option for this, unlike my other Ryzen 5 Gen2 which I ""set and forget"". This should be better documented AND AMD needs to properly support Windows Server versions for their drivers and Ryzen software. With proper setup, I can run it under load with temperatures around 70c. Sometimes peaks around 80c, which worries me enough to watch it, but nowhere near the 90-95 I was originally seeing. Bought a 3rd party cooler to be sure I had properly cooling.

  Upgraded from an Intel i5. Performance is fast, but don't fool yourself and think everything is lightening fast due to 12 cores. Unless you're benchmarking or running cpu intense processes, it isn't something that you will notice all that much. I updated my boot drive to NVMe and again, it isn't something I notice a lot. There is always going to be a bottleneck somewhere in the system. The only thing I can add of any value is a warning! After you install the cpu and heatsink, the thermal paste pad provided on the Wraith cooler will create a strong bond between the cpu and heatsink. If you decide to remove the heatsink for any reason, remove with caution. You could very well pull the cpu out of the socket and as a result... possibly bend pins. How do I know, I did it! But, I recovered and all is well. The cooler is a bit noisy. Idle temp is 45-55c and maxes out around 80c with Wraith cooler.

Running on a X370 motherboard

  Upgraded from a 1700x and installed this on the Gigabyte AORUS X370 Gaming 5 motherboard. The VRM and CPU temperatures certainly increased compared to the 1700x. During rendering the CPU hit temperatures as high as 92 C and the VRM was into the low 80s. I thought my NOCTUA NH-D15 heatsink would handle it a bit better, but by adjusting the Package Power Limit in the BIOS  I was able to get the maximum temperatures down to below 85 C and mid 70s for the CPU and VRM temperatures, respectively, with only a 1% loss in rendering time.Great CPU but it's certainly pushing the Physical limits on what is possible with the Desktop.

Dang fast

  I like most everything about this cpu. For gaming im only running 1080ti and I am seeing no bottlenecks on a gpu of that caliber. I can play very intensive games like battlefield 5 or red dead redemption 2 and stream them at 900p at h264 medium presets and never miss a beat. Its an absolute BEAST. For some reason I was worried about cooling this thing and almost when with an aio but i am extremely happy that I went with a Assassin 3 from deepcool. Even streaming streaming at 900p with medium cpu encoding in a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 i never saw a core above 61c. This is a testament to AMDs 7nm process. One thing I did not like about this platform as in zen 2 in general is that their cpus seem to come stock from manufacturers feeding 1.45v to the cpu. Ive seen this on the 3600 and now the 3900x. I assume this is something that has more to do with motherboard vendors than AMD but it is something to be aware of. I turned the voltage down from 1.45 to 1.25vcore and left it at stock clock speed and it runs 100 percent stable. I would say that for anyone gaming a 3600 is good enough prolly but if you want a beast that is overkill then this is the CPU for you. If you wanna stream intensive games and own a nvidia 20 series gpu I would still say a 3600 is still good enough because of nvidias encoding on their turing gpus. If you want to use a AMD gpu you cant rely on their gpu encoding and a cpu of this magnitude will serve you well and allow you to stream in high quality x264 for sure. So not the best value but a beast that I wouldnt trade anytime soon.

  I was always an Intel guy, but now that AMD is finally being competitive, I decided to switch. I'm very happy with my 3900X! While I was building my new computer I took my GTX 1070 from my old computer and threw it in my new build while I waited for my 2080 Super to arrive. My frames went through the roof!! I never realized how much the CPU meant in games (FYI I came from a 3770K, which was no slouch for the time). What the CPU really helps with is higher minimum frames. For instance in PUBG in my old system I was getting 50-100 frames with constant large fluctuations, on low-medium settings. My new system with the same old 1070 went to 80-120 frames on medium-high settings.

  Upgraded from a i7 7700k and this CPU is a monster. I usually go for Intel but I decided to give AMD a try for my new build and boy I do not regret my purchase. 12 cores 24 threads processor is enough power for streaming, gaming, or editing.

Absolute monster cpu

  I was running a R7 2700 overclocked to 4ghz in a workstation for scientific data analysis (next generation sequencing). I thought it was a pretty good setup. I had been thinking about the new Ryzen 3000 cpu's but figured the upgrade probably wasn't worth it. Couldn't stop wondering if it'd speed up my work so I finally just did it. And am I glad I did!The amazing thing is it stays above 4ghz even fully loaded. I expected it'd really slow down when hammering the cpu but it stays around 4.1ghz with all 24 threads crunching away.Compared to my 16 thread 2700, the 24 thread 3900x has cut the time to complete one particular workload in half. Seriously impressive, from 36 minutes down to 16 minutes.The 3900x only runs about 7C warmer than my old 2700. Using a Scythe Mugen 5 Rev B. Granted this is a workstation so the fans are not set to silent. But it tops out around 70C with all cores loaded.Do be aware if you're upgrading an existing b350/B450 or x370/x470 board from an older Ryzen cpu, upgrade your bios to the ""lowest"" or ""first"" bios which will support the Ryzen 3000 cpu first. Then install the Ryzen 3000 cpu. Once you confirm that it works, then go ahead and update to the newest bios available. Don't try to update to the newest bios with the old cpu though. That can cause problems. I had issues and had to mess around with upgrading and downgrading the bios until finally got everything working. Save yourself the headache and do as I mentioned above. Or follow your motherboard vendor instructions closely.Overall, really pleased with the upgrade.

State of the art AAA titles, even with a midrange video card I saw over 60 FPS while streaming videos to my TV from my rig. The computer seemed to barely have any problems handling the load while doing several other tasks.I want to note that this is running on a H150i liquid cooler, and I didn't see any heat spikes.Depending on your needs and future needs. I would without question say BUY IT! Yes, the up front costs of a R9 3900X CPU are high, but if you do any kind of multitasking on your PC, you need one today. It handles the load of multitasking exceptionally well. I don't know when if ever I've seen it crash under the load I place it under.

  I'll get to the point. Check your motherboard compatibility for the AM4 Matisse 3000 processors (I know most, if not all here already do) before dropping a sizeable amount on this beast of a processor.My current setup is:AsRock X370 TaichiAMD Ryzen 9 3900XXFX Radeon RX 580 8 GBSamsung 970 PRO SSD 1TB - M.2 NVMeEVGA 750W GPhanteks Enthoo LuxeBallistix 16GBPrimarily, I've been using this for gaming and molecular modelling, but everything I throw at it goes through with zero hiccups.I'm using the stock thermal that AMD supplied, and it's holding up to standard workloads of rendering and post-processing, with about ~59°C at 98% utilisation (no overclock). I plan on getting the Grizzly thermal right after this so that under hot days and larger rendering/processing workloads, this powerhouse won't overheat and fry on me.Download the RGB utility for the processor, and you won't be disappointed. I'm currently using the ""Zen"" mode which makes for a very relaxing experience.I upgraded from a Ryzen 5 1600, and wow was it a jump in performance. VMs, games (video rendering, etc.), Excel, and photo editing will all benefit from the extra processing power needed if you happen to do a lot of work in those areas. While it may be overkill to a point, right now, it's a content creator's best friend. Do consider what your own PC needs and what you will need it for, and if you have the budget as well as a current CPU bottleneck on your machine, I'd highly suggest making this a top contender on your list of things to get.The UNfortunate thing about this CPU is its increased power draw (105.0 W), so do keep that in mind, but overall there isn't much that AMD has disappointed with when it comes to this CPU.The only issue I had was that because I'd put my GPU in the lower slot on the motherboard, when I first powered the machine on after CPU installation, it kept cycling through POST and would not be able to connect to the display at all. This was an error on my part, but if anyone else seems to have the same issue, the solution is to simply plug the GPU into the upper slot closest to the CPU.If you're simply looking for something to game with and stream with, save yourself a bit and stay with the Ryzen 7 or most recent Ryzen 5 CPUs, but if you're needing this for applications such as AutoCAD, weather modelling, biophysical modelling, Photoshop, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, heavy video editing, then this CPU is very much worth the upgrade from an older processor. Be sure to get some new thermal compound as well, since the stock stuff will only last you for so long before needing to be replaced.

So right out of the gate my RTX 2700 Super Founders Edition had insane eye candy and much better speed.  Anything you through at it will open at break neck speeds.  Your mouse will be your enemy.  It will move entirely way too fast due to its processing power.  This thing mops the floor with all the Intel Chips ive ever owned.  Even my I9 chips dont game or compute as this chip does.  Its a must have if you want to play video games and do insane amounts of processing.  It operates on all buses on your system board quite efficiently.  Ive been debating messing with my memory timing as I have AMD Ryzen Memory Ready RAM which automagically times with the system clock of the CPU and AMD Ready Ram will run at 3600 MHz.  You must set your XMP/DOCP option in the BIOS.  But Ryzen makes efficient use of PCIE 4.0 and its fast.  You wont be disappointed other than it will push some heat but running any gaming on a 70 MEGS of video cache dedicated to video rendering makes this a seriously badd chip for anything you want to do.  Its smoking intel and I have been an Intel Fan for so many years until this thing fell into my hands.

Fantastic Product
","

  I absolutely love this CPU (3900X), having come from an old I7-2600K that served me well OC'd way over it's spec. I've got plenty to say about it. It's great at gaming and productivity. Intel can push individual cores higher, but their low core counts and larger process makes them very hot and bottle-necked at multithreaded applications. Be sure to read the warning below about the socket and swapping heatsinks.ThermalsWhen I first got this, I noticed it ran very warm! I read all kinds of complaints on forums of people that couldn't run this cool, or that couldn't OC it. I've been fortunate on both fronts. I went into the UEFI and brought the CPU VCore down to 1.298V while also overclocking to 4.3GHz (all cores). I've never had stability issues with these settings, although I may have simply won the ""silicon lottery."" The stock cooler is very aesthetic and works pretty well for a stock cooler, but I swapped out the CPU cooler for a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition, which brought the top temps down by ~10C under load, which I think is pretty respectable.WARNING!!! If you apply a heatsink to this CPU, and then remove it, there's a very high chance that the CPU will pop right out of the socket, glued to the heatsink and in the process bend pins. Bent pins on this processor are *VERY HARD* to fix (at least tedious to bend back without breaking off). The socket retention system on the AM4 socket compared to Intel's is complete garbage!!! I had bent about 3 pins pulling my heatsink off after just a little wiggling of the heatsink on the surface of the CPU by pulling off the heatsink while the CPU was still stuck to it. Yes, the retention arm was still down, and yes, I ensured it was installed correctly before putting on the heatsink. This is just a quirk of this socket. If removing the heatsink, very carefully wiggle it around side to side to try and get air in-between the CPU and heatsink so it doesn't rip out the CPU from the socket. If you're impatient,  you probably could just pull the heatsink straight up with the full intention of taking the processor with it, and then lay the heatsink with the processor straight up for removal, but I really wouldn't recommend it (unless that was a last resort).Over ClockingI wouldn't say I'm an expert over-clocker, but I've overclocked my systems for sometime, so I can at least give some starting advice. First, two things kill your CPU faster than anything else: heat, and over-voltage. There are a dizzying array of settings that can be played with in today's UEFIs. The ones to pay attention to are: VCore, CPU ratio, DRAM FCLK, and DRAM voltage. This is a CPU review, so let's stick to VCore and CPU ratio. My advice is to try lowering the voltage on this chip first! This is to reduce the heat put out by this blazing hot blowtorch. I dropped my to VCore 1.298V. Once you've verified that you can boot at whatever voltage you've dropped it down to, now try and overclock by changing the CPU ratio from the stock 3.8GHz to something a bit higher, like 4.3GHz. That's what I've been running with great stability. If you're going for pure performance, then you're going to want to stick with the normal VCore voltages and then push your CPU ratio, but you'd better have a great cooling solution that can handle the extra heat this will produce. Good luck!

  AMD did a good job this time. 3900x is a beast. The only thing is that the temperature runs pretty high when it fully loaded. You need a tower case with upper vents.

Overclocks while undervolting?  This is the s*$^*^%!!!

  My first AMD build went really well, except that I grabbed the processor from the side and almost destroyed it -- I didn't know that modern AMD's have the pins on them (ZIF).  Besides the high number of threads and speed for the price (compared to a certain other company), these are, as legends state, very conservatively engineered.  I had heat issues in my build, but I was able to just undervolt this CPU at the same time I overclocked it to 4.0 GHZ -- no more unpleasantly high temperatures under max load.  Just flat out rocks.

  I decided to upgrade to a R9 3900X from a R7 2700X and what an upgrade it was. I can't believe I was able to buy the 3900X for $389, what a steal for a Boss CPU. If you are looking to get a 3900X if it goes below $400 again, jump on it you won't be upset. Now all I'm waiting on is Big Navi (GPU) as I'm running a VII and waiting to see if Big Navi is as huge an upgrade as 2700X to 3900X is.

Great CPU

  This little chip is amazing. This CPU is a total overkill for almost any workload. You can have every piece of software running all at once, a browser open and 100+ tabs with a video playing and still play a VR game with very little performance loss. So if you are just a gamer then this CPU is a bit excessive.  It can run games incredibly well while still plumbing out heavy multi-threaded workloads.I'm thankful it came with an RBG fan but at the same time, it is loud. I actually ended up replacing it with the Noctua NH-D15.I am happy with this purchase.

Fast chip, lots of cores, but no on board graphics.

  This chip is super slick, super fast.  If you're going to run games, you need to buy a graphics card and integrate it with your build.  This chip will not play games on its own.  I ran into an issue with RTX NVIDIA game cards not working.  GTX game card did work.  There's a drivers or compatibility issue with either this chip or the mother board where it won't see the graphics card.  The build checker I used, said this would all work.  I believe it's NVIDIAs issue because everything else works fine without them.  So, do some research on the graphics card part of your build.

  I can’t speak on deep dive technical strengths and weaknesses since I haven’t kept up with the tech since 2004. I can tell you that the performance is leaps and bounds from what I started with. This chip replaced an AMD A10-5800K. It would take roughly 2-3 hours to transcode 1 hour and 45 minute videos in 1080p using handbrake. This Ryzen 3900x does it in 10-20 minutes! 4K takes awhile longer.... like 3 hours. CPU temps maxes out to 76°C while being worked hard. Idle temp is around 47°C using AIO water cooling.Other thoughts... wish I had waited a month. Could have paid $419 instead of $500.

  First of all, this is not meant only for gaming. If you do other works with your personal rig, please consider it.I was able to hit 7250-ish in Cinebench 20 with no tuning with a 3200MHz RAM kit. However, the biggest concern comes from the compiler support.If you plan to use MATLAB a lot, you will experience choke from time to time, even with MATLAB R2019.

  I upgraded to the 3900x from a i5-4690k and wasn't sure what to expect going to a CPU that is generations ahead in performance and has 12 physical cores compared to my poor i5s 4 physical cores. This CPU is like lightning in a bottle. I can have multiple programs pulled up at once and run a game at the same time eith no slowdown at all. Stock is 3.8 GHz but pairing it with an H115i AIO allows it to boost to 4.3 GHz and never go over 63C in intense gaming sessions. Think I hit the lottery on this one, honestly. I dont use it for any editing or encoding so I cant speak for that, but if you want a high end gaming CPU that is cheaper than the i9-9900k and has 4 more cores and 8 more threads then the 3900x might just be for you.

  A great price for performance! Intel should be losing sleep over the Ryzen family of CPUs and associated X570 motherboards.The built-in overclocking capabilities of the 3900X work fine, but the CPU runs much warmer (about 8 DegC) when idle.Higher idle temperatures mean that the system (CPU or motherboard) will fail sooner. I prefer a system that lasts for a very long time, so I just set my system performance to ""Balanced"" in Win10 and motherboard tools.To me, getting an occasional 15% or so boost in performance isn't worth the price of immanent system hardware failure.24 processing cores is plenty!

Amazing CPU paired with questionable cooler

  I am currently pairing this with a RTX 2080 and B450 Tomahawk Max, previously had a placeholder i5-8400 and Z370 FTW which also worked well. I really, really, really want to give this a 5 star review but I have a very glaring issue with the included cooler I will touch on later. Idle temperatures are in the low to mid 40s, raising to mid 50s when streaming video, mid 60s when playing newer games at 1080p maxed settings. No frame hitches, great performance. I've yet to test it with rendering but I have no reason to doubt it's capabilities at this point.Onto the issue I have, the Wraith Prism being bundled in is a great deal and you shouldn't have to worry about temperature issues when using it, very comparable in noise and performance with $100 air cooler alternatives. You will hear this, it is not quiet, by no means is it loud either though. I currently have my PC resting on it's side with the cooler attached without the mounting hinges being completely secure. It doesn't conventionally screw down, instead latching onto a mounting plate, when the latches are attached and locked, the cooler stops. No LEDs, fan stops spinning. The Bios will read it is spinning unless you unplug it and replug it back in, then it reads 0rpm, I have tested this in every fan power slot on my motherboard, no other fans in my system have this problem. When I just have it pressed down, attached with thermal paste, it runs completely fine. I am awaiting a reply from AMD to see if they have any idea what is causing this issue or how to fix it, unsure if it's just a faulty cooler at this point. Will update review when I have more information.Overall I definitely recommend this for it's price. I've only seen a couple other users with the same issue I have so I would still imagine for most people the stock cooler is decent enough, not warranting another about $100 for a 3rd party solution unless you are pushing this to it's limits.

In the second picture the only thing I did was to pause the Folding at Home and it dropped close to 30 degrees Celsius. I have order a much larger cooler to hopefully take care of the heat problem, and you should too if you have plans on working this CPU.

  Same performance as i9-9900k on gaming without overclock (max delta of 10 FPS at all times on 6 major HDR titles). Destroys the i9 in ML/AI processing power. Stock fan cooler is more than enough - even with core clocked to 4600mhz you're only hitting like 72 degrees under 4k extreme stress tests. Remember you're getting wider lanes with this chip so don't skimp on a good M2 NVME (Sabrent 1TB Rocket) or RAM (G.Skill RGB 3200Mhz-3600Mhz). I like the MSI ATX570 ACE with this because it will give you a few good years of support and supports 5000Mhz bandwidth which most cards won't reach for years.

Serious power for the money

  When comparing the cost of this processor to the same offering from Intel, it has serious value. I am coming from a 2700X in a x470 motherboard, and thanks to AMD's promise on backwards compatibility, all that was needed was a BIOS update. I was able to crank my RAM up from 3200 MHZ to 3600 MHZ, which was giving me some blue screens occasionally with my 2700X.The 2700X is still an excellent processor, but using it with a 2080 Ti + 1440p ultrawide monitor at 100 HZ was probably pushing it a bit in certain titles. I have already noticed improved frame rates in several titles, likely due to the ~15% single threaded performance increase, among other things.A few things about this chip:It runs hot. Like, really hot. They fit 4 more cores onto the same sized die as the 2700X/3700X, so it is to be expected. It does come with the prism cooler, but you will probably want to look at something more powerful. I am using the Corsair h150i 360mm AIO cooler, which has kept it relatively cool.According to AMD reps, the voltage can and will fluctuate up to and including 1.5 V. Traditional CPU monitoring tools won't work if you are looking to check up on voltage, because of how the processor is polled, so you need to use CPU-Z or the included Ryzen Master software.If you are upgrading from an existing Ryzen processor like me, with an older chipset (x370 or x470), update your chipset drivers! Not only will you gain performance (in my case, via Cinebench scores), but they also come with special power plans carefully crafted to make sure your processor isn't getting overvolted unnecessarily.

  AMD Ryzen 3900X runs very hot with the stock cooler as most reports suggest.  TDP on the 3900X is 105W and 95C which is a high temperature threshold which users have reported CPU can reach under normal operations; at 95C the CPU will either down-clock to cool down or may fail if you have automatic safety features disables.I have a high air flow case with multiple fans and radiators to cool my components so my CPU temp has not reached above 82C and usually stays below 70C under normal operations.  Frequency fluctuates depending on load because I have kept most of my clock and performance settings stock; it is not abnormal for CPU to be running at 4.2-4.5 GHz consistently with temperatures hovering around 65-68C at fairly low fan speeds which keeps them quiet.  Idle temperature changes on a dime but stays around 40-55C at low fan speeds.My PC works great although I had to spend a bit of time getting everything configured to work properly.  Works fast and the 12 cores/24 threads help with multi-tasking and processes that utilize multiple cores to process data.Benchmark tests may help you select the appropriate CPU for your particular case; 10th generation Intel Core i9 processors can run at faster frequencies which contributes to their lead in certain benchmark results such as video games; the AMD Ryzen 3900X has more cores which affects benchmark results relying on multi-core processing such as video editing or music encoding.The AMD Ryzen 3900X can run hot with stock cooler which will reduce your performance; many recommend good aftermarket cooler to keep CPU running fast and cool.

That model had been out for 2 years when I bought it, I used it for 5 years, and it could still drive every game I bought in 2019 just fine.  I only upgraded to be ready for the (hopefully) VR future.I bought the 9300X for the same reason I bought the FX 8350 ... the future.After 3 months I'm not regretting my purchase one bit.  I bought a RTX 2060 Super at the same time (somewhat future proof) and 32GB of 3600 memory.  With my rig I can play games full screen at 1440p HDR with 60 FPS+, with the CPU in power saver mode (which drops the frequency to 2.16 GHz.) while streaming a video on a separate screen, at the same time.In fact as I write this review, BL3 is playing in full screen windowed mode in the background at HDR 1440p using DX12 with quality set to Bada$$.  I also have a Prime video running on screen 2 (just for the test), and am listening to the Sirius XM app.  BL3 is running at 103 FPS.  The CPU is in power saver mode and is averaging 14% utilization.  Ryzen Master shows the temperature at 33C.That's what I call future proof.While the CPU has not hit the advertised 4.6 GHz boost frequency that I have seen, when I do run the CPU in performance mode and run stats on-screen I see 4.5GHz regularly.Unless some completely new CPU technology takes over and makes mine obsolete for gaming, I think I'll still be using this one in 2024 and possibly longer.

Long live King Ryzen

  I remember the day when I bought my first AMD processor. That was about 20 years ago.Back then, AMD was head to toe with Intel's offerings and that was a fun time when 256MB graphics cards were leading edge.Since then, Intel established itself as the King and left AMD in the dust when it comes to serious gaming and high-end workstation performance but we are in 2019 now and there is a new King that is ruling. Hail to the Ryzen!I spent the past week assembling my new AMD-based x570 system and the 3900x is placed on the Asus motherboard like a crown jewel.Man, this CPU is fast. It's faster than any Intel or AMD that I have ever tested. It's stable, it's efficient and did I say that it's fast?I coupled it with a new Geforce 2070 Super graphics card and haven been playing Modern Warfare since it was released this week and playing on the highest settings, while running multiple encoding tests and large file transfers in the background. No problem for this setup.What about our former King Intel? Should you consider an Intel CPU at this point vs. a Ryzen? Nope, it makes no sense. King Intel has been knocked off it's thrown and a new King is ruling.A word of advise on cooling. With the latest motherboard bios updates and stock settings, the included cooler will be fine. However, if you expect to run this cpu at full load with multiple cores running at full capacity (think movie editing, 3D rendering or other processor intensive tasks), then I suggest you buy a better cooling system because this CPU likes to run hot when maxed out. I did days of research on this and ultimately went for reliable and proven air cooling vs. a water cooler (aio). Specifically, I got the Noctua NH-D15. Get the new model that is all black. It comes with proper AM4 brackets and costs less than $100. It's ""completely"" quiet at normal use and barely noticeable when running the CPU at max utilization. I ran multiple stress tests for ""hours"". Before, the CPU would quickly reach 80 to 90 degress. Now, with the Noctua, I never go above 55 degrees. It idles at 25 to 28 degrees. This cooler will keep things quiet and lead to a long-lasting processor.

  Don't regret this one bit.  Originally I was planning on a 9900K build, but I felt as though 4 more cores and 8 more threads was better ""future-proofing"" than a few percent better single-core performance.  Overall a stellar upgrade from my old i5-2500k with a 4.2GHz overclock.  I have not overclocked my 3900x at all, but I did bring my infinity fabric up to 1900MHz with no problems which gave fantastic memory throughput.  Very excited about PCI-e 4.0 support on the x570 platform (haven't gotten a drive yet for budget reasons).  I tend to keep my components as daily drivers for up to a decade (last one made it 8 years), and I'm optimistic I've got a quality core component here.

  I do a full system build about every 8 years, the 3rd-Gen Ryzen CPUs were the first processors to get me excited since the 2500K Sandy Bridge and Athlon 64 in the past. Anyways this processor does not disappoint, I am just in awe of how powerful and how much computing power it has, I never imagined being able to do everything I can possibly think of on my three 27"" monitors, with no slowdown, quicker than I could ever imagine, and being able to game with the best of Intel's offerings. I'm Glad I waited and paid a little more for the 3900x I truly get excited everytime I sit down and use it, haven't felt that way in a decade with PCs.The only gripe I have for the 3900x and apparently it affects all the 3rd Gen Ryzens is how picky and finicky they are with memory, it is not for the impatient and undedicated to attempt to get memory timings, the FSB (infinity fabric as it's called) all perfectly synced with perfect voltages, etc. Seriously any change causes reboots and crashes, until everything is dialed in absolutely perfect, there is no forgiveness, but the sense of accomplishment and pride of going from default DDR4-2133 speed to DDR4-3733 was very rewarding and fun, if your into playing with BIOS. I added a couple Benchmarks, it's pretty much in the 99th percentile in everything. If you want a lot of cores, no compromises for productivity and being able to play any game at max settings, you simply can't go wrong and will not regret the 3900x... maybe only for the 16-core 3950x.

Absolute beast of a CPU
","

  I have always been an Intel user all of my life, but after my 5820k started getting a bit slow for my needs, I started looking for an upgrade. I have always thought of AMD as something that is considered to be a budget low performance build, but this has changed with the Ryzen Zen 2 architecture. I was split between either the Intel i7 9900K or this chip. Just looking at the raw performance specs for the Ryzen already shifted my attention away from Intel for the first time. The multi-core performance on this chip destroys Intel's by a long shot. Sure, the single core performance is better on the Intel which means it is slightly better for gaming, but who only games on their PC? For someone like me who also works with video rendering/gaming streaming, there was only one clear winner. I have been able to throw anything at the 3900x, and it does not even struggle at all. My video render times at 4K have dropped by more than 3x. When I stream at slow preset for x264, my CPU is only using at max 20% load.My advice for people who are split between Intel and AMD: If you do anything other than just pure gaming, AMD is the better pick. If you really only play games and not stream, choose the Intel (but I think most people aren't in these situations). I have been extremely happy, and I think this CPU will be able to last me a while until I need to upgrade again.

Great performance at a great value

  Very impressed with this CPU. Yes its expensive, but the performance you get for the price is very good. Running this with a GTX 1660 Super in the mean time until the 3080's are back in stock, and even currently it can run every game i've thrown at it with 60+FPS at high+ settings. I really went with AMD because they tend to be better than Intel at workstation applications in their consumer line of chips, and i've noticed this is a bit faster at applications like Blender and Premiere compared to my 2019 iMac with an Intel 9900k.

Good all around chip for it’s price.

  Great chip, my binning wasn’t the best so boost will only go up to 4.55 gHz single core, but can get to 4.2-4.3 all core when under multi load for at least ~10ish minutes, but usually stays around 4.1gHz. I’m coming from a i5 6600k. Gaming performance is as good as I can ask for, but that’s usually more GPU limited. I do more R programming and Excel for number crunching more. Excel at least to my feeling is a bit worse at utilizing the chip than what it did with intel, but I’ll have to work a bit more to get the feel, have been procrastinating on some major projects.AMD knocked it out of the park with this one, good all around daily driver, then again I’d probably not feel it myself anyways.

  I went from an i5 and i7 to this. The first thing I noticed was this CPU runs much hotter and the fans were much louder. That is until I went in and tweaked voltage and set up some custom profiles via Ryzen Master. Now the only time I ever hear the fan is when you expect to hear it. I threw a 4K HDR 60fps game at it with no issues. Works great so far on WIN 10 with all kinds of apps (photoshop, after effects, premiere, blender, maya) and some of the latest games. This CPU combined with the latest SSD and an RTX GPU is a realy beast of a setup. Best upgrade to my CPU since my original i7 purchase years ago. I'm also using the stock fan and my CPU temps hover at 40 degrees while casually using the computer. The highest I've seen it go is 78. Ended up using arctic silver paste instead of the included paste, though.

Even if this is too pricey for you, I would recommend looking at other options in the Ryzen family (e.g. 3800X, 3700X, etc.) You will get a better value than buying an Intel processor.Oh and if you are wondering whether this can handle <insert game here>, it can.

  If you need a relative monster of a CAD workstation on a budget mate this to a decent  but affordable motherboard with a Radeon Pro WX 3100. You can find some dirt cheap now. Other than using the 4 gig of vram for texture storage many CAD programs don't use the GPU for more than translations, rotations, and such then the GPU use basically drops to practically nothing. Comes with a 3 year warranty. We built a budget rig for one client and Solidworks render times were about half a similarly priced Intel based rig.

To be clear, I am a freelance software/game developer/database consultant, so I needed the cores and was really overloading my old system. But I have literally saved days of down-time when I was unproductive because my computer was tied up working on a compile, render, or database operation. For me, time is money, so this is well on its way to being paid for.Oh, and it games like a beast also, since I do play other people's games when I have some downtime.

  Overall amazing cpu for the money, program compiles so fast with this. One thing that drove me nuts though is the idle temperature and the fact that every little program pinging the cpu for some quick process drives the chip into boost mode; causing the idle temperature to spike up and down like a roller coaster.Tried on and off for a week to turn the damn thing off. Had to go into bios and turn off precision boost AND turn off auto clock multiplier (You have to manually set it, don't recommend this if you don't know what you're doing). Leaving any of these one options on will result in boost mode and constantly spiking temperatures.I'm using the stock fan, with boost on it ranges 39-60 when idling. With boost off it generally stays around 38-40, spiking to 50 every now and then.

Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't run that hot so you don't need to worry about overheating unless you are doing extreme overclocking. This thing would give any Intel processor a challenge.The only reason I am giving this 4 stars however is due to the heat sink. Its a good looking heatsink but my issue is with how it gets mounted on the CPU bracket. The way to install the heatsink feels rather clunky. The holders that mount onto the CPU bracket feel very flimsy and are difficult to remove and place on. Honestly, it feels like you could damage the CPU if you are not careful with installing it and removing it. I would recommend getting a different heatsink if you are going with this CPU.

  First computer build so I thought I'd splurge a bit and get the Ryzen 9 and oh boy have I not regretted it.  This baby hums like nothing I've had before.  I've only had intel chips in all of my other devices in the past, but have been a long time fan of AMD and finally got to experience it.  I threw it on a x570 board and she booted up fine no problem.  Tweaking the overclock using Ryzen master has been so easy to use and figure out.  Go team AMD!!1

Awesome Processor

  Makes quick work of any and every task you throw at it.  Per CCX overclocking is required to push it to it's full potential which is tedious but well worth it.  Shreds my decade+ financial models and games well to boot.  Last AMD processor I used was an Opteron 170 circa 2007.  Bravo AMD, about time you caught up to the big bad Intel.  Looking forward to dropping in Ryzen 4000 next fall.  Absolutely love the commitment to long lived socket types unlike Intel's disgusting annual refresh.

Very great value for mixed-usage user

  While intel is still the king in terms of gaming (though by only a narrow margin), amd has closed that gap tremendously. Compared to the 9900k, this CPU is almost as good for gaming. Considering the huge difference of clock speed, this shows that AMD finally has a better ipc(instructions per clock). To notice any difference in gaming, you have to pair with a very high-end graphics card as it is very hard to bottleneck this cpu (think 2080ti). However you start to do some productivity things that take advantage of more cores, like rendering or encoding, and AMD absolutely wipes the floor!I was able to get a good overclock to 4.3ghz. I recommend that even non-overclock users change the bios voltage as for some reason the motherboard manufacturers have very high out of box voltages. Use the stock voltages for the cpu and you’ll get much better temps

Truly a Beast

  I bought this to build a workstation PC for a friend.  He is a video editor and was having a lot of trouble rendering on his Mac laptop.  This thing absolutely shredded his render times and has made him more productive by probably an order of magnitude.  He isn't a hardcore gamer, but he has his favorites for his free time.  I paired this with a 2070 Super and again, he is very happy with the performance on any game he throws at it.  Cooling wise, I just used the included cooler and some Noctua fans for the case ventilation.  Overall, money well spent.

  I like this processor very much. It's powerful and cheap. What I love most about this processor is the noise level. When not gaming, the fan on the processor is ""quite"". When gaming, it's a bit loud, but it's perfectly within an acceptable range. The heating is the same as the fan. It's around 40 when, not gaming, but it gets up to 85 when gaming. I would repurchase this without second thoughts.My only unfortunate thing was the price. I live in Tokyo, and the price here is ridiculous. Those living in the States are fortunate when it comes to prices. Building a PC here is super expensive.

  Price per core wise your better off getting the 3900x over the 3950x, it’s mostly a use case scenario to be completely honest. If your looking for a high core count cpu for “cheap” $500 for 12 cores vs. a $300 increase for 4 more cores, I choose the 3900x. Stays nice a cool, the wraith coolers are actually pretty decent if your wanting to save a little money and wait to a get a better cooler it’ll do the job for basic tasks and light gaming without damaging it in the slightest. So far in gaming applications haven’t seen it go over 20% usage, and pulls its weight very well when I’m rendering things in blender. All around recommend it if your looking for a nice upgrade.

Overall satisfied with this AMD processor after many years on Intel.Removing one star due the temperature and power consumption during idle and light workloads. After tweaks in BIOS and custom power plan this consumes 20-30 watts in idle (compared to i5 at 5 watts). Not ideal for HTPC setup in a small case with restricted airflow.Out of the box with stock cooler and x570 motherboard it is very loud due to idle temperature jumping quickly between 45-60 degrees and default fan curve maxing the loud stock fan at 60 degrees.

  I bought it for creating and illustrating 3DCGs. Graphics related tools are not able to use GPU assistance for UI operations and some filter operations. CPU performance is important in these situations, and the 3900X allows me to work without stress. You can feel the high performance of the CPU.I also use it for my other physics simulation hobby, and it completes numerical integrations and many-body problems very quickly.I've installed and used Ubuntu 20.04 as my OS, and so far No Ryzen related problems.

  Let's just get it out of the way and say that this is an absolute monster and will handle anything you throw at it. That being said get a nice cooler because the performance on Zen chips is directly tied to the thermals. The cooler it runs the better it runs(obviously).

","

  Product runs great after bios updates on motherboard. Was running high temps and voltages out of box, with part of the reason being the stock cooler wasn't sitting flush on the processor. If it wasn't for that I would give 5 star instead of 4. I would recommend an after market cooler for this processor anyways though.

Horrible Experience
","

  I bought the CPU from a local retailer but decided to leave this review on here since it will get more views:I bought the Ryzen 3900x early August with a brand new x570 Aorus Master Motherboard. I installed everything and did a fresh Windows 10 install. Fast forward a couple hours after installing, I start to get BSOD errors. I think maybe it's the XMP profile, so I go into the BIOS and put EVERYTHING to Auto. The crashes are still happening. During all these crashes, the computer's fans are ramping up and down continuously and it sounds like there is an airplane in the house.I play around with all the settings to get the computer to be stable AND quiet. I finally get the computer to be quiet but now randomly the fans stop spinning. The computer is still crashing. I decide to reinstall windows 10 but the issues continue. This time many of the crashes do not lead to BSOD but instead the computer screen goes black and the computer randomly restarts. Now I am very confident it is an issue with the motherboard. I return the motherboard and buy a x570 Crosshair Hero VIII Wifi.Installed the new motherboard and a new Windows 10 installation. Soon after the system is up and running, I am getting the random restarts. The computer just freezes and restarts. Now I am thinking that maybe it is the RAM. I have tried every possible RAM setting imaginable  and it just doesn't work. So I buy new ram (Trident Z Neo) which is approved to run on x570, and sure enough, the issues continue with the new RAM.Now I am thinking maybe it is the PSU. So I buy a new PSU, and guess what?! The issue continues.Throughout the whole process (5 weeks), I am emailing AMD customer service who are of no help whatsoever. They do not have any solutions. They headless chickens following protocol. Also throughout the process, I was sure to install the latest drivers, bios versions, and chipset.Needlessly to say, the CPU is the issue all along. Horrible product. $500 spent on a product that doesn't work and to make it even worse, customer service is nonexistent.Sure, they made a great CPU on paper. But if driver support, customer service, and stability is horrible, it doesn't matter. I will be sure to never buy an AMD product ever again.

Incredible CPU
","

  This CPU is a total overkill for almost any workload. I can have basically every piece of productivity software that I have running at once, with a browser open and 100+ tabs with a video playing and still play a AAA game with very little performance loss. So if you are just a gamer then this CPU is a bit excessive. A Ryzen 7 X3800 would probably be a better choice, but if you game and run heavy multithreaded workloads like 3d modeling / CAD, video editing, or rendering then this CPU is awesome. It can run games incredibly well while still crushing heavy multithreaded workloads.With this CPU I can work on models with way more active points in Zbrush. My old CPU (Intel i5-4690K OCd to 4.4 Ghz) would start stuttering around 2-4 million active points, while this CPU can handle around 20 million. It is very nice to be able to work on a model at that detail level without having to use Zbrush’s Geometry HD feature.Another big advantage of having this many cores is that even while a heavy multithreaded workload is running there is usually still enough CPU left for normal computer functionality. When I was stress testing this CPU I ran Prime95 then I forgot to stop it. I went on browsing online and watching a video without noticing that anything was wrong until I started to run another benchmark. I really noticed this when I rebuilt the lightmapping in Unity the other day and I could still use my computer normally, with my old CPU my PC would be barely function during this process. Admittedly most applications that are really multithreaded allow you to set how many threads you want them to use, but with this may cores you will probably never even have to think about it.As many other people are reporting mine does not seem to turbo up to 4.6 GHz, the most that I have seen on my monitoring software Is around 4.54 GHz, but this CPU is so powerful that I do not really care. Plus I get a solid 4.15-4.2 Ghz clock on all core loads, which is really good considering the rated base clock is 3.8 Ghz. I get cinebench R20 scores that average around 7350, my old CPU just got 1580. Idle temps are around 40C and full load temps are about 70C in a good air cooled case. I am using an ASUS TUF 570 motherboard (which I highly recommend) and 32 GB of 3600 MHz ram.

Fantastic Processor!

  As of 7/13/2019, you just can't get a faster processor for a combined productivity/gaming computer. AMD just set a new bar when it comes not only to performance, but price/performance ratio as well.Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that still need to be worked out, but AMD has acknowledged them and is working on squashing them as quickly as possible. AMD also underestimated the demand at launch, so product availability is an issue. Luckily, none of the bugs are complete show stoppers.One note to the vendors that are selling them for extremely high prices: Consumers remember vendors that take advantage of a situation like this, and not in a good way.

Insane performance at an even more insane price
","

  I'm guessing that if you're reading these reviews, you're at least somewhat knowledgeable about CPUs and how they work. It should come as zero surprise to you that this CPU is as incredible as the specs suggest. Multitasking has never been smoother, and the 3900x absolutely eats well threaded workloads like I have personally never seen before.True, it is behind intel by low single digit percentages in game performance, but are you really going to notice the difference between 130fps and 126 fps? Absolutely not. What you will notice is how that performance stays relevant as games and software progressively grow to use more cores and threads, because this guy has 4c/8t more than the only relevant competition (9900k).So, lets review. Not only do you get a processor which nearly matches intel in gaming performance, but also- destroys the competition in multitasking, streaming, and content creation/workstation tasks- is futureproof for you and your new PC based interests AND the next generation of games, which are becoming more multithreaded- has better thermal and power efficiency (105w is the BOOST tdp vs the 9900k's 95w BASE tdp)So, what now? Just buy it. There's no contest. Assuming you can get your hands on one, there's quite literally no way you can go wrong.

Upgraded from a 1700 to a 3900X. MASSIVE performance.
","

  Easily 30% increase in single core speed, and more than double in multi thread. Yes, a 24 threaded CPU is 2X a 16 thread CPU. In games that favored Intel that I played, Killing floor 2 and Insurgency saw a massive uplift. I no longer get dips below 100fps I used to get with Zen 1. I can finally stream with SLOW preset and get 0% FPS drop. I can only do FAST on the 1700.

Don't pay more than $499 for this part. Don't give the scalpers your money!

  This part should only cost $499.  People and third parties buy as many as they can and sell them for more money than they are worth(this should be illegal, but whatever...).This is a great part and it should handle any workloads or games you throw at it with ease!It comes with it's own cooler that will keep your stock cpu temps under control.  If you plan to overclock, you may need a better cooler.

Not Stable on 3600mhz DRAM

  I've spent days trying to get the CPU to work with 3600mhz DRAM - Won't do it.  Randomly hangs on restart.  Everything else is good.  Tried 3 types of DRAM, 3 Motherboards, two PSUs and swapped with a 3600x on a different system.  3600x works great, 3900x still hanging.  Going to call G.Skill to see if they have a suggestion then RMA the CPU.  Very disappointing.

  When from a AMD 6X Phenom II to an AMD  Ryzen 1800X to this Ryzen 3900X. First off I will have to admit that I wanted to buy it from my friends a Amazon.com but I was not fast enough even though I tried from midnight July 7 for 4 hours. Just too may people trying at the same time. My build is as follows: Aorus X570 Xtreme (no regrets), two year old 32GB Corsair DDR-3733 CL17 set at 3600 CL16 16-18-18-37-54 (could only get 3466 at CL18 with Ryzen1800X), Samsung 960 Pro M.2 1TB PCI-Express 3.0 (will upgrade to PCI-Express 4.0 in the future), 2X WD 1TB HDs in RAID 0, Asus ROG GTX 1080 Ti, 3.5 year old Corsair H80i GT water cooler, 6 ugly Noctua premium fans (you can't see) in a Corsair Carbide 200R case. This system is ultra quick in all productive work beyond expectations. It is very quiet and runs cool even under load due to the VRMs in the Gigabyte X570 Extreme and my ugly but fast and quiet Noctua fans with the Gigabyte SIV fan control software. I do not play games, however I do entertain myself flying Eagle Dynamics DCS World simulation jets which is based on Direct-X 11. With all DCS World settings set to maximum and flying over the most extreme terrains my worst case FPS dropped to 45-48 with the 1800X. Now with the 3900X and that same scenario my worst FPS is 62-65 and most of the time is above 85-90 FPS. Bottom line is that single thread IPC is so close to the competition you just don't care and multi-threaded performance is beyond insane all while running cool and using less power. Also, the system is now every stable compared to the 1800X which became twitchy when the settings were pushed to the limit. I will note that I could have put this Ryzen 3900X into my old Aorus X370 Gaming-7 MB but that would have been it. I now have an upgrade path for the future. I highly recommend this CPU. There is no downside.

Unbeatable value. Great gaming performance? Definitely. Insane Multitasking performance? Not even a question. I upgraded from a 3570k oc @ 4.4ghz. The performance difference was day and night.  I cant max out its performance currently since everything I've thrown at it, it cuts through it like a hot knife slicing into butter. I had built an AMD PC back in 2003, and I didnt think I'd be back to the AMD platform since going Intel.With Intel putting out tiny increments in power each generation, things were getting stale. AMD breaks out with what we thought wasnt possible at an affordable price. I held off buying the first two gens of Ryzen since the gaming performance wasn't truly there 100%. That changed with this 3rd gen with the IPC improvements. So I knew this was going to be the generation I jumped to AMD, an upgrade that was a huge upgrade IMO. So I figured, since I was making a big upgrade I should make it a BIG upgrade... so I went with the 3900x.You wont be disappointed with this processor. You'll be set for a long time with this. And with 8 core consoles releasing for next gen, games will soon take full advantage of 8 core cpus. 3900x gives you 12 cores, so you wont have to worry about making requirements in future video games.If you're on the fence. It doesnt get better than this at this price point.

  This chip is unreal OK? INTEL IS DONE FOR! No one can deliver performance per dollar like AMD, and when performance per dollar ceases to compromise on overall performance there is NOTHING that should be stopping you from buying this thing. Forget gaming, which AMD is neck in neck (For REAL this time!), but just about any task you can throw at this thing it will chew up spit out and ask for seconds. Video Editing, Virtual Computing, EVEN LIGHT SERVER WORK THIS CAN DO! For those of you that criticize maybe the 1FPS that intel has over AMD, consider this. These days graphics cards are the single influence in most AAA titles, and for all the rest, well, lets just say i ditched intel and never looked back. Running this with my AsRock X470 Taichi (OVERKILL for a chip like this) and 16gb of G Skills Flare X (cas14) OCed to 3400 with my GTX 1080 all i can say is WOW

This CPU is a beast!!! The fastest PC I have ever owned :)
","

  I am new to PC Building and did a lot of research before venturing into building one and I am so glad I did; I am extremely happy with the outcome and proud to own one as this is the fastest PC that I have ever experienced let alone building one. This PC was intended mainly for work (due to COVID-19 WFH) and for some light gaming.This CPU is a beast in performance and can perform really well when paired with the right PC components. AMD Ryzen processors are picky about RAM and when you pair it up with the right one optimized (such as below) for Ryzen CPUs with suitable clock speed and network latency, it does really well and the result is a work horse. The included Wraith Prism Cooler is very attractive (RGB colors are super cool and vibrant) and does a good job of keeping the CPU cool but the fan noise could be a bit louder for some people but it did not bother me at all.I have not done any benchmarks yet but my PC is able to handle anything I throw at it without a lag; be it opening several office (excel, word, PPT) documents, opening 50 different browser tabs, running applications etc. all of them run super fast and with absolutely no lag or delay and they feel to open instantaneously. I was able to install office software in just under a minute tops. The games loaded and played pretty well; and I have tried Fortnite, God's Trigger, Remnant, Troy a Total war saga all with no issues.  I am coming from a 20+ years of Intel chip experience ( and IT background) and I can confidently say that this is definitely a great leap over performance.My full config for reference:Fractal Design Meshify Mini C Tempered Glass (white)Motherboard: MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk (Wifi)CPU: AMD Ryzen 3900XRAM: G.Skill Trident Z Neo Series 32GB PC4-28800 DDR4 3600MHz CL16-19-19-39 Model F4-3600C16D-32GTZNC {This RAM is specifically optimized for Ryzen processors on X570 chipset motherboards and need XMP profile turned on in BIOS to take full advantage of the performance }HDD: Samsung (MZ-V7S1T0B/AM) 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB - M.2 NVMePSU: Gamemax 850W Gold+GPU: ASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2060 Super Advanced Overclocked EVO 8G GDDR6 Gaming Graphics Card (ROG-STRIX-RTX2060S-A8G-EVO-GAMING)Overall, highly recommend to anyone who is serious about PC performance and have a budget for the processor ;)

A great CPU for gaming
","

  I jumped ship from AMD to Intel back when the E6600 i-7 was launched (about 13 years ago if I remember correctly) and I've never looked back. I was planning to upgrade to the i-9 9900K and even had everything picked out and in my Amazon wish list ready to purchase but I like to do my research before buying new tech and I decided , after much thought, to give AMD another go. I love gaming plus I video edit occasionally and use Photoshop and Lightroom a lot so I thought the AMD 3900x would be a good choice and I wasn't wrong. The chip runs games with ease and mine is paired with a RTX 2080 super. The biggest plus for me so far is being able to stream games in high quality using only the CPU while leaving the video card to solely deal with the game graphics. I'm using OBS to stream and I have 16 thread of the CPU dedicated to streaming and it doesn't miss a beat so for anyone wondering about games only using one or two cores and the rest going to waste, I can vouch for this CPU being able to multi task while gaming. Most streamers use a second computer to stream, well this CPU is my main and second computer. If you are reading this and can't make your mind up on a good CPU for gaming and/or editing and multi tasking then I'll help you out, just buy it and pair it with a good motherboard and be very happy.

The perfect workstation processor that can game while it's at it!
","

  SummaryIf you are just looking for the perfect gaming processor, this thing is over-kill. However, if you have some heavy workload's like A/V rendering, AI, virtualization, or serving a database and want to be able to game on it as well, then this is the processor for you. At $500 vs $1000-$1500 for some comparable processors, the 3900x has ushered forth a radically new cost-to-performance paradigm in the world of workstation processors.Complete build for context:CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900XGPU: AMD XFX Radeon RX 5700 XTRAM: GSkill Trident Z RGB 16GB DDR4 3600SSD: 1TB Rocket Nvme PCIe 4.0 M.2PSU: Corsair VS650MB: Gigabyte X570 I AORUS PRO WIFIPerformance:*Workstation Use*The 3900x handled every workload I have thrown at it with ease. From multitasking, to intense rendering, Ihaven't run into a single problem. Paired with the PCIe 4.0 SSD every action is practically instantaneous. Its pretty nice to be able to use my computer while rendering and still have it finish faster than any other processor I've ever had.*Gaming Use*The 3900x has no issues chewing through the toughest processing loads of even the meatiest games. The vast majority of games don't come close to what could be considered a challenging workload. Late game Stellaris and Crusader Kings 2 (Both of these games get very processor intensive in the late game) are actually playable now, and I've been able to resume construction of my massive space station in Kerbal Space Program. The Witcher 3 is running at 100 fps at Ultra in densely populated areas and has only gone down to as low as 90 fps during fights.Cooling:It actually feels weird calling the Wraith Prism a ""stock cooler"", with its copper pad, direct-contact copper heat pipes, and RGB lighting, it looks and performs like a $60-70 after-market cooler. In my setup it enables the 3900x to consistently run at a clock-speed between 4.0-4.2GHz with a max temp of 81C under 100% load. At the base clock of 3.8 GHz, it never makes it past 75C. Honestly, if you aren't  going to be overclocking or running 100% usage workloads all day every day, there is no reason to replace the cooler with an after market one. The stock cooler is more than adequate for gaming at 4.2Ghz. The highest temp I've seen while gaming was 70C. However, I intend to replace it with water cooling before starting my next big project.Power Consumption:The 3900x consumes a surprisingly small amount of power compared to other 12 core processors. At just 220 Watts under load at 4.2 Ghz, the 3900x leaves plenty of power for the rest of the system.

  Just smiling a little bit as I’ve been cleaning out my old computer parts closet. Started building computers back in the early 90s. Always on the internet waiting for the next big thing. Thousands of dollars later I have boxes of cpus and memory and mo-bos that at the time I’d be waiting for ups. 12 months later doing it again. Now I don’t think I could give all this stuff away. I’m retired now and wish I had some of those thousands back. Lol oh well it was fun while it lasted. You folks wait till and comes out with the 128 core super duper red hot volcano. And these world crushing cpus will be hard to throw out cuz you know what you paid for them. I’m not criticizing , just being a little window to the future. Computers are fun but new tech is possibly the worst investment on this planet. Unless you can build it and sell it for a profit in a couple months. Anyway have fun. Wow. Just remembering when the athlon 6500 came out. Back then it wasn’t multi core it was multi processor lol

  Pros:- Blistering benchmarks.- Solid temperatures with premium (third-party) air cooler.- Performance / cost is exceptional.Cons:- I have only seen the 4.6 GHz boost one time on Core #0. (See below)- Default voltage requests from this processor are large.- Precision Boost 2 vs Precision Boost Overdrive.Depth Dive: It has been nearly 20 years since I ventured into the AMD market. The Ryzen 9 is an incredible processor, especially for the cost. I think this is evidenced by the consumer demand, but let me talk a bit about my performance experience. I paired this processor with arguably the best air cooler on the market, and the CPU sits at 37-40C idle with the die temperatures being reported at 32-34C in HWInfo. Under full load stress testing, my processor maxed at 60C, which is essentially the same as my previous build. Thus, despite external concerns regarding the TDP of the 3900X, I find no anomalous issue in this department.My experimentation with voltages, however, left me far more confused and concerned. Out of the box, the default vcore of my new build was set to 1.48V. This is, in my opinion, obnoxiously high and sits well above what I understand to be safe for silicon. Sure enough, if I look at VIDs, I find that the CPU is still requesting voltages that high. I set a voltage offset of -0.1V in my motherboard bios. At this value, I actually found a benchmark maximum, and my average vcore during an uptime cycle now sits at a far more comforting 1.227V.4.6 GHz appears to be a promised land with the Ryzen 9. I only hit that value once, during one benchmark test, on Core #0. My typical frequency maxes during an uptime cycle are [4.53, 4.50, 4.50, 4.48, 4.53, 4.48, 4.35, 4.33, 4.35, 4, 33, 4.35, 4.35] GHz across the 12 cores. With my voltage offset shown above, my typical base level clock sits at 3.6GHz instead of 3.8 in HWINfo, though taskmgr reports 3.8 GHz and this is my choice anyway. Under a full load benchmark test, I tend to see 4.1-4.2 GHz across all cores. Some might view all of this as a con, but for context, my CPU is still putting up incredibly strong benchmark numbers, with Cinebench r20 consistently reporting 7342 and CPU Mark hitting an astounding 34142 (again on an air cooler). I have also avoided using Precision Boost Overdrive, as global research has shown it to not be significantly more effective than just leaving things up to Precision Boost 2. AMD should have probably come up with more distinct naming conventions as PB2 is merely a stock boosting processor feature, whereas PBO falls into the realm of ""defined as overclocking"" and is not considered ""in-spec"".It would really be nice to see a comment from AMD clarifying the voltage issues I described above. I've found a lot of discussion on that particular topic, but all of the listed 'facts' appear to simply be conjecture and opinion. Any AMD tech around here? Maybe drop me a comment? Save the day? ;)Overall, I have found my Ryzen 9 experience to be incredibly enjoyable thus far. For an enthusiast with knowledge of how to build and setup a computer, every concern I just listed could be easily addressed. Frankly, at the time of writing this review, there is just no other processor on the market that can do what the 3900X is doing -- especially at this price point. It is certainly worth a serious look by those in need of a CPU -- including from those who have been flying a different colored flag for quite sometime.

  This CPU is overkill.. I wanted overkill.. Otherwise, I would highly recommend the 2700.As an early adopter for the AM4 platform, I have been satisfied from the start, and this is the best of the best for the tasks I use while computing. Bought day one from Microcenter at MSRP. Installed in place of 1700X. I knew the AM4 platform would change very fast, so I bought the highest end 1st gen Ryzen motherboard, the Crosshair VI Extreme with all the bells and whistles.Pros:Streaming and gaming is phonomenal (can stream and game at the same time with no issue)Stable 4.2GHz (with H115i)Price is very good for what you getPlug and play (dropped right in with no issues)Comes with Wraith max cooler (sufficient if not overclocking)Photo editing no longer lags around during processing in photoshopMore cores than I actually need, which helps with multitaskingCons:Depending on who you are, the release window of the 3950X was surprisingly short after the release of the 3900X and I grit my teeth a little bit with that move from AMD, had I know it was going to be so soon I would have gone for the 3950X just to further future proof.

Stop thinking, get it.

  This processor is in my opinion as good as it gets before you hit diminishing returns. If you can justify a 9900k for gaming, this is a no Brainer alternative. It's offers gaming performance of less than 10% difference, and offers near 50% higher performance in multi threaded tasks. It's truly amazing. Alot of review sights state not to get it for gaming, but I disagree. The argument is you are getting less than 10% better than a 3600/3700x, which is true, but if you're comparing it to the intel 9900k price point, it's completely worth it. No compromise chip, at a non wallet melting price.Included stock cooler is nice for stock operations.

Lightning quick; the wraith needs some factory refining, however.
","

  Its lightning quick and handles anything you throw at it like a champ; if you plan on using the included wraith cooler with it however, take note that the heat-sink contact plate was horrendously uneven and trenched where the heat pipes ran through. It required a good deal of sanding, with some very fine wet-dry paper on some glass to get it down smooth enough for a good, tight fit. After doing so it dropped temps down on avg. about 15 degrees.If you don't plan on liquid cooling it, or adding a different aftermarket air-cooler to it, you may or may not end up having to use a little elbow grease to get it to comfortable temps. This is the only reason I dropped a star.

After the software updates over the past year, it's just gotten better and better.

  When I originally put my PC together and tried to find out what kind of overclocks I could do I was disappointed with not being able to get 4.6ghz with PBO in the bios. later found that advertised speed was not for a full all core clock speed. Decided to leave it be and enjoy the stock speeds for a few months as overclocking in the beginning was in need of some bios updates and when they finally came in a few months down the road. NOW running a 4.2ghz ALL Core overclock. I thought this thing was fast then after the overclock it turned out to impress even more, and all this while still remaining at less than 42 Degrees Celsius. The hottest it has ever been is 62C under stress tests (This is using a kraken x72 watercooler)Ryzen Master is a software used for tuning the cpu, memory, power etc. and there have been many complaints about it in the past but now I feel pretty confident using it and I have never had a problem with it whatsoever. Using this to make adjustments on the fly or to fine tune an OC made it so simple and fast.Buy this CPU.

  So, 2 reasons to set 4 stars - first of all, stock cooler is a total waste. It would be better to have price lower and no cooler at all with the stock package. Any amount of load without OC would push it to 84-89 deg C range with stock air cooler - not acceptable at all.Second - it is not clear what kind of marketing stunt was to say it can get to 4.6ghz boost. Not a single core not once on my sample got above of 4273mhz speed. Not once. It is an amazing chip for VMWare and video processing tasks, but,  it is not a 4.6ghz one. I run it with 'stock' AutoOC and PBO active.PS. a response to Thach - you are wrong. there is a pure manual OC, and there is an AutoOC on the x570 chipset, in combination with the precision boost. now i got CORSAIR HYDRO H100i PRO cooler finally on, AutoOC is set to 200mhz+, voltage changed to 'OC' from 'stable' - it gives more or less stable 4.18-4.22ghz overall in davinci resolve when cpu is at 60-70% load. still, not even REMOTELY close to 4.6ghz boost. best single core speed seen so far now is 4.39ghz.  cinebench 20 gives a 7150 score, in average, and during that stress it sets cpu speed to 4.07ghz.

Amazon doesn't want to limit or restrict this type of stuff so some third-party retailers have the audacity to sell a $499 CPU for $600 to $1,000 and this CPU isn't even the 3950X which is hilarious to list it at the price point. Other than that small rant of both Amazon and AMD.Here's the numbers from LinusTechTips:- 3900X has 100% performance for Overall and Productivity, while Gaming is at 95%.- 3700X has 87% performance for Overall, 70% for Productivity and Gaming at 94%.- i9-9900K has 87% performance for Overall, 70% for Productivity and Gaming at 100%.- i9-9700K has 80% performance for Overall, 59% for Productivity and Gaming at 97%.In most if not all games, the i9-9900K will get more FPS and in some games the 3900X will be on par with the i9-9900K by only a few FPS difference. In the end it's a judgemental purchase, it's what you really want in a CPU and how long you've been with that specific company for. So far, I'm glad I made the switch because Intel won't be releasing any smaller nanometer CPU's until sometime in 2021 or even 2022 based on a cooperate news article. Intel was like; ""You know what I'm thinking Simmons? Let's just put a pin in that discussion.""If AMD can keep it up and release a CPU next year or even in 2021 to close that 5% gaming gap, I think Intel will be crawling in a hole, lowering prices of all their CPU's and most likely actually innovating or someone at Intel will be getting fired. So, in the end, I thank AMD for pushing the Games Industry... We can only move forward now with the best competition ever created... Red Vs. Blue.

Might be dead CPU or MB
","

  October 2 Update. The motherboard issue confirmed. I took the MB to a local computer parts store and tested it with 100% working processor. The motherboard is broken it has a short circuit somewhere. Sent the MB to RMA.MB or CPU Died in a week. Not posting anymore. Will buy another MB and update hereIt is hot. I use the stock cooler with maximum rpm of 2500+ and the processor sits at 50 degrees Celsius when idle. Hits 83 degrees with a stress test. I have additional coolers installed. When on a Max load it seems my PC is going to fly.The motherboard fan is crazy loud all the time especially because of the video card covering it completely.You don't have any of the mentioned problems with Intel ( they don't have a match right now, but offer stability over core count). Overall, I am happy with the specs on paper and disappointed with stability and technical side.

An Overkill and Remarkable Processor!
","

  Where do I even start. I've never thought I would own such a powerful CPU. I stream on Twitch pretty religiously with tons of other background processes going on. Nothing stutters. Opening applications during rendering, still smooth.I stream with CPU encoding, while my base resolution is 1440p. Down scaling to Twitch at 900p. Still no stutters and frame drops. I don't know what else to throw at it to see it struggling. This is well worth the 500 bucks if you're worried about spending that much. My upgrading days for CPU is over thanks to this bad boy!My other specs might be helping it out too so maybe that's why it's running lightning fast.32GB ram, RTX 2070 Super.If you have a similar rig, trust me, it's worth it. Even if you don't though, this will boost the performance in ways you can only see it to believe it!

Very fast, very good, semi-okay bundled cooler.
","

  If I was rating this based on the included cooler alone, it'd maybe get 3 stars. It's fine, but it's kind of loud and doesn't have the best thermal capacity in the world.The CPU though, this thing is fantastic. Mine is handling a decent overclock quite well, and honestly doesn't even need it. 24 threads for this price is unbelievably good, and if you have *any* use case for that many threads, there's no reason to buy anything else. This is the best compromise out there between single- and multi-threaded performance, and it delivers in basically every way.

AMD is Back on Top with this CPU

  Congratulations AMD! You have done it again, a smoking fast affordable processor.AMD had fallen behind Intel in the CPU race for the last 10 years. They leap frogged way out in front in processing power affordability with the Ryzen series. We are AMD fans again, at least for now.Consumer loyalty is as Fickle as the Finger of Fate.

This thing is a beast
","

  Got it when the price dropped to 418$ to build a new rig to replace my old Phenom II X6 1090T. This thing is a beast and coupled with the proper cooling and other hardware, produces impressive results even without OCing which is more than enough for me. I didn't use the stock cooler because I am very concerned about the fan noise. I am using Corsair H80i V2 AIO to cool it and the temp hovers around 30C when idle. In my humble opinion, this is far better in terms of performance/cores/threads per $. I would highly recommend the Ryzen 9 3900X, and also strongly suggest pairing it with a X570 motherboard (I have the ASUS Prime X570-P with 64GB G.Skill DDR4 3200 MHz RAM).

  1st upgrade for me in 10 years (coming from Intel 990X Extreme).  I was skeptical that it would be that much difference since I had been upgrading my GPU's on a regular basis.  Cut to the chase:  Man is there a huge difference in these 2 Windows machines, and the AMD 3900X is king!!!!  Do yourself a favor if you are in the market for a new DIY PC.

  I originally went for a intel i9-9900k, then I saw intel’s 10th gen release. This made me took a bit more research on which cpu I would buy and I found AMD Ryzen 9 3900X. This cpu is already a value winner compared with i9-9900k, and I am surprised that even compared with i9-10900k, it is still worth buying! The benchmark scores in many fields are competitive. If you are a heavy gamer and single core And of enthusiast, go for intel. But for regular gamer and creative work and engineers with cpu complexed work, I think this cpu is definitely worth to consider.Plus, the stock cpu fan does its work and comes with RGB. Worth every penny.

  This is a great processor.  My old HTPC died so I used this processor as part of a new build.  My old CPU was an i7-4770k (4th gen Intel), so it been quiet a while.  Therefore in my opinion this Ryzen processor FLYS!!!!  Love it.  Everything is faster, snappier better.  Now I know I'm comparing a 7 year old CPU to an 8 month old CPU but that is the upgrade path I had.  I notice a huge difference.  If you are making a lesser upgrade than YMMV.

   This CPU is amazing. It was a huge upgrade from my 2700x. Gives out flawless, amazing quality for streaming and no dropped frames when gaming (and streaming!) 3900x is perfect if you need to use a one PC setup for editing/gaming/streaming. My 2700x wasn’t able to flawlessly stream. My frames would drop down to 90-70 when I was playing on 144hz. Regardless, the 3900x gives out much better stream quality since you can just use slow/medium/fast and it’ll still run nicely. I use Photoshop and DaVinci (video editing) and it works wonders and is super fast and fluid. This CPU is a MUST buy! I included a clip from a previous stream for quality check. Hopefully amazon doesn’t ruin the quality.
