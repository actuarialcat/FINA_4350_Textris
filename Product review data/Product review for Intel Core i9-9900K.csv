Gaming Hero
","

  Let me start by saying I'm the dad and would not have purchased this.  However, my son wanted to build his own gaming PC for Christmas and since I was foolish enough to say make sure you get the best components you can because I don't want to upgrade your machine in a month, he bought top of the line products.  And let me tell you this,... this thing cranks!  My son is the envy of his gaming buddies and they all drool over it's performance.  If you are building a gaming PC and want top end performance, then buy this.  If you are a dad and want to become ""D. O. T. Y,(Dad of the Year)"" buy this. This is absolutely 14 year old approved.P.S.  I got socks for Christmas  :)

Best performance for games
","

  Great processor, just a side note the Asus Maximus XI series motherboards come with 4 phase VRM and can barely clock this at 5ghz stable.  Do not pair this processor with an Asus motherboard - this is coming from someone who almost exclusively buys Asus motherboards for PC builds since 2007

High temperature and throttling
","

  It is a beast when combined with Asus z390 Maximus hero and 32gb gskill 3200 cl14 but..forget about overclocking though it runs very hot already Intel has push it as far as they could compete with the market right now with AMD, it runs very fast but it also down clocks it itself a lot because of the temperature and the power limit,I have Noctua NH-D15S with two installed fans and temperature rises up to high 70sC and spikes to mid 80sC while gaming that's just unacceptable high temperature comparing to an i7 5820k overclock to 4.2 was mid 50s c with a smaller CPU Cooler.the clocks doesn't stay steady unless you fiddle with the BIOS and it takes a lot more than 95 watts and I have spiked up to 180 Watts just on the CPU.This CPU obviously needed a die shrink but intel was in a rush to release this processor to compete in the market..Other thoughts: it is a must have really good CPU Cooler and even then it will run very hot...

Slow shipping, faster than CPU it replaced
","

  Took a month to arrive so minus one star. Tempted to chop off another star because I expected to get 10nm by now. But they did well enough with this yet-another-14nm CPU. Let's all take a moment of silence as Moore's law is officially laid to rest. RIP.-Performs 40% to about 100% faster on all of my workloads than the 4-year old 6-core 22nm i7-5820K it replaced.-I9 consumes only a fraction of the power and less heat at low utilization compared to that old x99 chip.-Peaks at about 176 watts after 12 minutes of running P95 torture test. Temps briefly peak in low 80's for that dated and unrealistic test. (Motherboard maker monitoring software shows mid 70's, Intel software shows low 80's...)-Except for initial setup and testing, I don't manually overclock the 9900k since that would only give me about 3% more performance than I get running optimized with no power restrictions enabled (e.g. out of  Intel TDP spec, but the common default for these early Z390 boards). Just disable the throttles and enable auto for the voltage and stuff.-5.0 GHz for common few core load for long periods, and 4.7 GHz on all cores forever under heavy load (e.g P95) is what I'm seeing with the above config. I'm just using basic H115i PRO AIO cooling and have yet to see any workload force throttling to the official 3.6 GHz speeds.-Times have really changed since my hard core overclocking days 20 years ago. With throttles disabled, the CPU does exactly what I would want to achieve. It's organic overclocking virtually out of the box. Turbo boosts to workload optimized fantastic speeds when needed, reduces down to less than 25 watts TPD when not under stress even while still hitting 5.0 Ghz. I don't have to do any switching or adjustments between workloads. No distractions. Perfect!-Unlike the much more expensive xx99 chipsets, Z390 enables Intel onboard GPU with Quick Sync for better performance and lower CPU utilization/power consumption, which is something I have long missed for some of my workloads, one of which runs 24x7.-Seems to be a great price if you compare to x299 platform prices. Thanks to AMD's innovation, Intel is cannibalizing its own HEDT segment.It's marketed as a gaming CPU, but IMHO it's a great choice for workstation needs. There's a lot of frustration in the 12-year-old-at-heart gaming community with this chip. It's expensive for that market segment especially with prices inflateddue to the 14nm shortage, it lacks much innovation over last year's offering which upsets the frequent must-have-the-latest upgraders, and there's really not that much headroom for overclocking without industrial cooling equipment.If you have an older (3 years+) CPU and looking to rebuild your system and want to invest in a high performing chip at a comparably reasonable price (compared to x299/HEDT platform and adding in extra cost due to the 14nm supply shortage), I9-9900K is a fine choice that gives you the latest and greatest. It's a safe bet since Intel's 10nm performance chips are likely now a 2020 thing.If you want more value, get AMD's latest. We all owe AMD's innovation some gratitude for forcing Intel to offer this 8-core chip in this segment. Long live AMD.

Awesome gaming CPU, bring a great cooler.
","

  Works fantastic, easily clocks to 5ghz on all cores, however be prepared for some serious heat, especially under load and/or bench-marking. Make sure you have a decent sized AIO water cooler or a super awesome amazing air cooler before attempting to overclock or push this chip.Performance wise my focus is purely gaming, and it eats games for breakfast. Playing at 100fps on brand new titles like Assassin's Creed Odyssey like it's nothing, plenty of headroom to spare. Barring any massive game changing development in the next few years (DDR5 ram er, maybe?) this should future proof you about as well as any chip could, probably 3 to 5 years depending on what next gen consoles launch with (Meaning if PS5 launches with 16 cores (very doubtful) that may become the standard for games and your 8 core 16 thread pc starts looking old hat (even more doubtful). ANYway, barring something totally left field like that, I can't see anything gaming wise this thing won't be able to devour for years to come.I'm satisfied with my purchase, and the price (bought at $530) IS high but doesn't bother me too much because they have a price point for most everyone, with 9700k, 9600k, 8700k, all more than capable of fantastic gaming performance at lower price points.Let's be clear, I'm of the opinion you don't buy this for gaming because you need it, you buy it because it's the best (mainstream) cpu out there, and because you feel future-proofed (maybe, possibly, you never know). I like knowing I've got tons of power to spare for that next big game coming next year. If you feel the same, then go for it, you'll likely love it. If you have budget constraints and need to choose between this or a great gpu, definitely prioritize the gpu and buy a 9700k, 9600k, or even the 8700k or 8600k depending on how much you have left.And also the packaging is pretty so you can display it and show it off to your friends.  0.o

A Pleasant Surprise I Consider Myself One of the Lucky Ones
","

  So after a very long wait (I preordered on October 20, 2018) I finally have my brand-new shiny I9 9900K in my hands. I started to get a little upset when I started reading all over the Internet the people who preordered after me were getting their product before I was. Had a chat with an Amazon rep online last Friday the 16th and he said to give him five days and they would ""make the product available for me"" I took his word for it though I must admit I thought that he was just saying whatever he could to satisfy me. Then the day after Thanksgiving I'm made aware that my processor will be delivered on Tuesday, November 27, but let me bring you to tonight Sunday, November 25, I login to Amazon to order some random household items only to discover a message saying my processor will be delivered on Saturday, November 24. My heart starts pounding because naturally, I was awake all day yesterday and not once did I hear a delivery truck, knock at the door or a ring of my doorbell. My heart starts racing because we have had a rash of package thieves recently in our neighborhood, so I make my way up the stairs at 1130 at night to check and see if there was a package on my front doorstep, at first I don't see one but it turns out the Amazon delivery guy put the package behind one of the double doors. After I saw the package I breathed a small sigh of relief, at least I can say to myself thank goodness nobody took it. My next concern was actually opening the box and hoping that my Intel packaging was not broken like I have seen in some other Amazon reviews, they used a pretty big box and although they packaged it with air you could still hear something rattling around inside quite freely and that did worry me. I delicately brought the box into my bedroom and proceeded to open it with the precision of a surgeon making his first incision. I was perplexed when the first thing I saw was black, turns out the processor box itself was in a very nice soft black pouch (I guess they spare no expense when you start buying these higher end enthusiast grade CPUs). Much to my delight I'm one of the lucky ones and my packaging was not damaged in any way shape or form. This also makes me extremely happy because for $570 (after-tax) I now have one of the coolest futuristic looking product packages Intel has ever produced and my inner nerd wants to proudly display this on a pedestal because I think it's one of the coolest things I have ever seen, (I know I'm simple and easily amused LOL).I'll be upgrading from a Core I7 8700K using a Noctua NH D15 cooler and a recently purchased Z390 Taichi Ultimate paired with 32 GB of Trident Z RGB 3200 MHz DDR4 Samsung 960 Pro NVMe GTX 1070 8GB graphics card, among other assorted parts. I use my system for two main primary purposes gaming and video encoding with handbrake and Adobe Premiere. With an overclocked I7 8700K clocked at 5 GHz on all cores I average about 135 FPS when encoding a standard 720 x 480 resolution video. It will be very interesting to see what I'm able to achieve with the I9 9900K. I know it will not be that big of a jump coming from the 8700K but my current system is only about two months old, With the exception of my motherboard which I recently upgraded from a Z370 to a Z390 about two weeks ago, my previous system for the last four years was a 4790K so as much as I will be comparing my results between the 8700K and the 9900K what matters most to me is the difference in performance between the 4790K and the 9900K.For those that may be interested I will update this review when I have those numbers

Fast and hotter than heck
","

  No doubt this is fast, but the cpu heat is ridiculous. I built this gaming rig for my son.Asus ROG STRIX Gaming E Z390Asus ROG STRIX 2070 OC GPUI9-9900kG.Skill 2x8gb Ripjaws V PC4-25600 CL14XPG SX8200 480GB 3D NAND NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 Solid State DriveCorsair Air 540 case, with 5 static pressure low noise Corsair fans.Noctua NH-D15 cpu coolerThe noctua cooler is pretty much the best air cooler on the market, with temperatures matching and often beating AIO water coolers up to 280mm. The I9 clocked at 5ghz on all coores will overwhelm it though, which likely means you would need a 360mm AIO or more likely a custom loop to cool this beast. In truth, the factory setting of the Asus motherboard were such that the standard overclock provided by Intel (5ghz on 2 cores, 4.7ghz on all) was creating temperatures in the mid 90Cs, well above where I'd prefer.I hate water coolers, and think they are overhyped in general. Definitely not worth their risk. So, I set out to maximize the system performance manually and better control the heat. In the end I was able to dial the voltage down from the Asus default, and set the core speeds to incrementally decrease as more cores load up, but still be OC. I then setup adaptive vcore voltage to further reduce temps and hopefully increase the cpu lifespan. In the end I have 1 or 2 cores at 5.2ghz, 3 or 4 cores at 5.1ghz, 5 cores at 5.0ghz,6 cores at 4.9ghz, 7 at 4.8ghz and 8 cores at 4.7ghz. I use an AVX offset of -4.  At these settings using air cooling, it tests at about 80C at each core level. AVX tests at 86C max. This leaves some headroom in case room temp is above normal. The system idles in high 20Cs to low 30Cs. Normal gaming runs in mid 50Cs to mid 60Cs.I used hwinfo, cinebench 15, occt, and prime95 while dialing in my settings.In most games he sees it hitting 5.1ghz very often, only when a game uses a lot more cores does it drop.So, it's fast, but it will take some manual work to keep your temps in line. And remember to keep your PC dust free inside, as a lint blanket will likely put this thing into an early grave.

  Reviews speak for themselves. 8 cores and 16 threads are wonderful to have for gaming and multi-thread applications.I have mine over clock to 5ghz all core with 1.33v manual setting using Intel burn test on the ""maximum"" testing setting the cooler I chose is the noctua d15 and using a Asus Maximus xi  hero motherboard.I want to say this so I can hopefully help someone out especially if you will use an Asus motherboard and you intend to overclock....this is to save you from blue screens and crashing that many people trying to overclock this CPU are experiencing.Go into bios and turn OFF Asus mult-core enhancement.Also in bios turn OFF XMP then look on the side of your ram sticks and notice the ram speed/timing's/voltage it is specd to run at and manually input this into the bios so you get the speed you paid for.If you don't do this you will continually get random blue screens and crashing...I ended returning one good CPU, motherboard,ram and Rtx 2080ti thinking that one of these components was no good only to have the same problem again after getting all new products all over again for my build...doing what I described keeps the Asus bios from altering voltages,timing's etc on the fly when it wants which cause these crashes..This equipment is too good to have to deal with these issues.Really great fast chip. Hope you enjoy and hope I helped you avoid some problems.

  Replaced my i7-8700k with this i9-9900k on my Asus Maximus X Hero Z370 motherboard. It works!

Are you risky enough to go for medium price MB and beast 9900k?
","

  At first I ordered the 9700k and Asus Z390 Prime-A motherboard.You may ask Why ASUS board why not Gigabyte etc? I used to use Asus all my life (beginning from core 2 duo processors or even Pentium 4).So, the system was ready to go and it was fast, quiet desktop with Fractal Design R4 case and Noctua D15 cooler( with two fans).No more fans than stock ones in my FD case (one for intake and other for outtake at the back).I OCed the system to 48Ghz at 1.26 Adaptive voltage or so (I don't remember exact number of voltage but 100% it was lower than 1.3v).And I created my computer and I looked at it and it was nice :)But then I started to view benchmarks, assessments in syntetic tests and noticed that 9700k is faster than 8700k in most cases. It faster than 7820x in most scenarios but....But 9900k is much more faster in rendering, photo editing and streaming tasks. In two words, in those cases where multithreading takes place and all real cores + virtual cores are used at their 100%.And ... I made a decision to purchase 9900k.It's a costly investment but I thought I would sell my current X99 5820k computer + sell 9700k processor.It's as good as done.My 9900k was in my hands and....And only then I discovered from various reviews about bad VRMs out there for medium line ASUS Z390 boards.I was frustrated.How come?Why ASUS did so?Should I buy new motherboard now?My Z390 Prime-A is a medium line MB (in one line with Strix and maybe a little worse than Z390 Maximus Hero).I started to research and came to conclusion (having tons of sources in the net, including video reviews + comments to them, articles, reviews from community etc etc) that my ASUS Z390 Prime-A will be suffice for 9900k with moderate OC. To which extent - this is the question.Will I surrender or try?Am I a risky person?No I am not.But... how hard I wanted to try... I could not control myself and I did it.So... ASUS z390 Prime-A + 9900k + 32Gb 4x8 Corsair Vengence + Noctua D15 + PSU Corsair 650X + two more 140mm fans for my case (one for upper outtake and one additional for front intake)Thermal paste I applied to the processor is Arctic MX2Also, I must specifically note for people who will use the config. I used discreet graphics card (XFX RX 580), I did not use internal graphics. Maybe usage of internal graphics may cost you more in temperatures and wattage.When I first started my computer I entered BIOS andI STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO IT: TURN MCE OFF IN BIOS.This is the most important thing you can do.Why?Main reason to do so is the MCE puts very high default voltage to the processor.Then increase power limits:Long Duration Package Limit is 190WPackage power time window is 2secShort duration power limit is 220W.Current CPU capability is 170%CPU SVID support EnabledVRM Spread Spectrum DisabledSVID Behaviour Typical ScenarioIA AC and IA DC  load lines to 0.01CPU Load Line Level 5 (not sure this parameter works at all due to set previous ones to 0.01)VT-D enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)VMX enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)Now, I played a lot with core multipliers and voltages and came to these results:Core mutlipliers for 2 first cores: 50Core mutlipliers for another 6 cores: 49Cache multiplier 43AVX offset: 3 (I strongly recommend to put this offset)Voltage: Adaptive (I know, many reviewers and commenters do not like adaptive voltage. I like it.)Adaptive Additional Turbo voltage 1.25Adaptive Offset : +0.015For memory I set XMP I profile (3200Ghz 16-18-18-36 2T)For your system these voltages may not be appropriate, all depends on your die's quality.Also I played a lot with offset for the Adaptive voltage (see below why).Now the system is ready to go.My ambient temperature in room is 22 CTests I used:1/ Prime95 Small FFT non-AVX version.30 minutes with 4900 on all cores.CPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 75 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 177W (max)2/ Prime 95 Small FFT AVX version30 minutes with 4600 on all coresCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 76 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 179W (max, though I notices some peaks to 181W rarely)Where I played the most was the Prime95 with AVX enabled.The issue was that some cores stopped intermittenly (one or two cores) during full load (in 5 minutes or even in 15 minutes).The community recommend to increase VCore a bit in that case.In the continuous process of playing with all this I came the above voltages.I suppose I could put 50 to all cores and 3 AVX offset and get 80 C temperatures but I did not do it as I don't like so high temps.Of course, with regular apps and even other stress testing apps like Cinebench, Realbench, Aida or Asus Exteme Tuning Utility you do not get those temps at all.I double you can actually load the processor that hard (16 threads with 100% load) with any regular app. Let alone for so continuous time...Also I tuned my fan curves so they spin at 90% when CPU temp goes upper than 65 C.So at high load even so super silent case like Fractal Design R4 is loud like a rocket.This all makes me conclude that all those talks about loose VRMs on these boards are no more than just talks.Of course I don't know for how long the processor + MB will last in my scenarios but it works nice so far (3 weeks) with regular loads: compilation, photo editing, virtual machines etc.From this point I can compare my old computer (Asus X99-E + 5820k overclocked to 4200Ghz) to this new one.Forgot to mention, by the way, I use NVME Samsung 960 EVO 500Gb drive in my system.On older one I used Samsung 860 EVO 500Gb.Everything runs faster, and works blaze faster on newer PC.The system with 5820k even OCed at 4200 was somewhat meditative at moments (maybe old Win7 OS with bunch of trash slowed it down or what).I will make additions to the review when I will have something to add.

It's good.

  I've got one about the same quality as my 8700k, as far as power use goes. This performs well at 5GHz for all cores, pretty snappy. I'm not happy about the price I paid here though, I should have waited a week for restock and Prime (paid 750, for ""DealsADay"", avoid), but that's my decision and consequence for impatience. In the future, I will (try to) hold out longer than the gougers will.All of the little stuff like that aside, this is a solid processor. Expect some toast temps though, even though this is indium soldered die-IHS, it's still hotter than my 8700k @ 5.3~GHz with gallium alloy. I don't think this core is worth de-lidding or modifying in any way, though. It's smoking fast at 5GHz, and the temps are reasonable for this quality of die, as far as manufacturing types. Intel specifies a tcase max of 105C on this one, I believe.

CPU is fast but run super hot.  Require some OC knowledge to keep temperature under control.
","

  Rated 3* because this CPU required me to fiddle with BIOS so I can run it at stock speed with reasonable temperature.  I'm writing this review so buyer would be aware and prepare to deal with possible high cpu temperature.  If you're lucky with Silicon Lottery, your CPU may be able to run much cooler than mine.I have purchased this CPU with ASUS TUF Z390-Pro Gaming, Corsair Dominator Platinum 3000Mhz 32GB and CORSAIR HYDRO H100i Pro.  I have been using this setup since mid December 2018 without any problem.  I have seen temperature goes as high as 80+ but usually stay at 62-65 Celsius on Load with game like Witcher 3.Recently, I played Anthem and noticed my radiator fan run loud and when I test with Battle Field 5, that same loud fan noise.  So, I open hardware monitor and saw my CPU temperature peaked at 100+.  I have tried different thermal transfer paste and same issue.  Then I noticed the MB was dumping up to 1.6v to the CPU.  That's horrible voltage for running it at stock speed.Here are couple things I have done in Bios to remedy the heat.Multi-core Enhancement => Disable (this is the cause of over voltage)CPU Loadline Calibration => 7 (this is to help system stabilize while tighten the cpu voltage)CPU Voltage => 1.275 (I started with 1.35v and reduce until I reach here.)My system is now peaked at 85 Celsius during stressed test and/or while playing BF5.  Looks like Frostbite Engine also utilize AVX which cause high CPU temperature.  I also did ordered 360 radiator; a 240 doesn't cut it.

I9-9900K is suitable for use as workstation CPU
","

  I9-9900K is suitable for use as workstation CPUIt took me a long time to receive the product. I mainly use it to do the creative work of animation special effects content, so I will focus more on this product.First of all: the 9th generation CPU can still be used on the Z370 motherboard (users need to update to the latest BIOS); but if the result you want is the pleasure of overclocking, it is recommended that you replace the high-end Z390 motherboard, or you use the very expensive Z370 motherboard (such as MSI's Z370 Godlike motherboard, which is super-high. The Z370 motherboard at the end provides better CPU power supply capability).Second: Although the 9th generation has replaced better thermal conductive materials, a set of radiators with good heat dissipation performance is still the preferred condition. When I do pre-crushing calculation or heavy load rendering, the temperature is still very high. Well, the radiator I use is the X61 of NZXT.Third: If users use ordinary Z370 motherboard, my personal suggestion is to work at the default frequency as far as possible. I have tried to test FPU in 5G state, and the motherboard will actively interrupt the process. I think the maximum power consumption has exceeded the capacity of the motherboard. Although this Z370 motherboard can let me another I7-9700K work at 5.1G frequency and pass various stability tests, but for I9-9900K 5G pressure, the motherboard is powerless.Fourth: The multi-threaded rendering score of I9-9900K test CineBench R15 at default frequency is about 2000 +, instant overclocking to 5G, and the score is only increased to 2100 +. The fever is not proportional to the increase of power consumption. In other words, the dividend of overclocking is far less surprising than expected, so I would personally suggest if It's a job requirement. By default, it has performed very well. It's not even different from the default frequency I9-7900X. Unless you're really a user who lives on overclocking, it's still a good way to use it by default.Fifth: If the purpose is simply to play games and get a higher number of game frames, it is more reasonable to invest in a high-end video card than to buy a CPU, or to use I7-8086K and I7-9700K, you will find that there is no obvious difference between them in the course of the game.Finally, I9-9900K is more suitable for building a primary workstation. It has good rendering ability and high frequency support for single-threaded computing. In this respect, I think this is a very good CPU. One of the screenshots is a test map, and the other is a screenshot of the working modeling status.Forgive my chattering and thank Amazon for his customer service efforts. Goodbye.

8 Skylake Cores + Low Latency Interconnect + 14nm++

  This is the product I was hoping Skylake X would be.Pros:8 cores in a ring bus with low inter-core and memory latency allows this CPU to excel at any task.Stream + game? It'll do it 50% faster than the next CPUs down just because there's so much resources on the chip. Checkout the GamersNexus review.Game + Plex server? Same deal. It's the magic of more cores.x265 encoding? Why not? Just be prepared to cool it!On a performance level, the CPU will boost to within 10% of max overclocks right out of the boxSoldered IHS means ~220W package power is still cool-able with AIO or high-end air cooling.These are basically the highest of bins and really ""fun"" to overclock or undervolt with AC/DC load line values, if that's your thing.Cons:It's still using Skylake architecture cores and now there's 8 of them; judicious use of power limits is recommended.Conventional cooling beyond 280W package power is nearly impossible without delidding.Intel knows that this is the best consumer CPU and they're charging like it... but I don't remember this level of salt when AMD asked $500 for a 1800X last year.

Keep your expectations in check!
","

  First, I'd like to start off by saying gaming isn't my primary focus. I use my builds for work first, gaming second (a very close second). I've gone through 3 different CPU's in the past year. Started off with a I7-3960x, then to an I7-8700k, then to a I9-7900x, and then finally landed on the I9-9900k.Seeing as how Xeon's are out of the question both in price and practicality; higher end consumer chips are a good bargain for people like me. I work primarily with Autodesk Maya and use Arnold or V-Ray as my renderer of choice. So core count and freq are important to me. Since I focus on viewport performance, single threaded performance is paramount for me as it's key for great gaming as well. The 9900k does this beautifully. Logic would have dictated that the 8700k would have worked just fine....and it did but, those 6 cores really showed it's weakness when V-Ray rendered out particle simulations such as smoke. Thats when I figured I'd get the 7900x as it's got 10 cores and it should shred through renders; and it did but, I lost out on single threaded performance in viewport and while animating. So, intel released this bad boy; it seemed to good to be true and required me to lose pcie lanes and switch back to z series chipset. For me it was a worthwhile expenditure.Cinebench scores for me were the deciding factor. My 7900x ran a 2243 @ 4.5ghz on all cores (custom loop). The 8700k ran a 1400 -1500 on a dark rock pro 4 @ 4.7ghz on all cores. My 9900k @ 5ghz on all cores on a dark rock pro 4 ran a 2086. That was impressive to me; sure the temps were a bit uncomfortable for me as anything over 65c to me is close to tjunc (I know I'm dramatic) but, when I leave a render on for hours or even days I want the assurance knowing my build isn't going to fry. So backing down the 5ghz OC on the 9900k to 4.7ghz all core, I'm at a comfy 65-70c on AIR.The performance gain while working in viewport in maya is NOTICEABLE and worth the expenses. Most who purchase this CPU aren't doing my line of work and want it for gaming; at least from my research and for gaming. This CPU crushes anything I've thrown at it. I have this cpu paired with a EVGA 2080 Ti FTW3 in a Fractal Meshify C Mini and neither of my components have hit over 70c while gaming on my X34P on any game I've played at Max!Subnautica 144 hz Avg HIGH Preset/Filmic FilterGR Wildlands 100hz AVG Very HighOW 160Hz Avg Epic/100% ScaleBO4 140 hz Avg Very HighMHW 90 hz Avg High Preset (also MHW doesn't support 21:9 if anyone knows how to get it to please let me know)In closing:Pros --Exceptional single threaded performance for workstation and gaming loads-16 Core turbo 4.7ghz on air stable AF render performance in Arnold is Amazing!Cons --16 Pcie lanes-Gets a bit hot for my comfortFinal thoughts: Unfortunately technology isn't where we'd all like it to be right now.

Review en español I9 9900k
","

  Compre este procesador por su buen rendimiento en juegos, y con la esperanza de que no tenga que cambiar de procesador hasta dentro de mínimo, unos 3 años. Anteriormente tenia un I7 6800k overclock a 4.4 ghz que me estaba dejando algo atrás en algunos juegos triple A.Puse el procesador en una MSI Z390 Godlike, con un EVGA AIO 280mm, con liquid metal en lugar de pasta térmica, sin deliding.Sin overclock, el procesador llega a temperaturas bastante altas, 68° con un AIO de 280 mm. Con un overclock de 5.0 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.38 v, llega a tener picos de 75°c en battlefield 5 cuando más se está utilizando, esto tomando en cuanta que es invierno con una temperatura ambiente  baja. Con un overclock de 5.2 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.41v, la temperatura de base es de 52°c promedio con picos en battlefield 5 de hasta 85°c con los abanicos a 1300 rpm, ya que a esa velocidad no hacen tanto ruido, podría subirlos más, pero el ruido es demaciado alto.Tomando en cuanta varias cosas, como que el AIO es bastante bueno, el que use liquid metal en lugar de pasta térmica, y la baja temperatura ambiente, el procesador produce bastante calor y esa es una de las consideraciones principales que se tiene que tener si piensas comprar este procesador; en cuanto a su rendimiento, el procesador es muy bueno, es muy caro (540 dlls más taxes y envío en algunos casos), solo por el precio y el problema del sobrecalentamiento no le doy 5 estrellas.Para que tarjeta madre usar, recomendaría cualquiera que cueste más de 200 dlls, siempre y cuando no sea ASUS, ya que su tarjeta de 280 dlls es solo de 4 caras, mientras que las MOBOs de gigabyte de 200 dlls tienen 12 caras, así que evitar a ASUS en este caso sería la mejor opción.

Great CPU
","

  I don't usually post a review on CPU's or MOBO's but I notice some of these comments are all over the place, so I thought I'd add my two cents. I'm very pleased with this CPU. Currently running it at 5.10 on all cores at 1.27V with a custom loop dual rez/dual 360 rad/dual pumps/Eloop Noise Blockers in a Phantek Evolv X case. I had it running a stable 5.2 at 1.29 V but lowered it. When I get a new CPU I don't like to stress it at the beginning. I allow it to break in for a week or two. I'm running it on an ASUS Formula XI board. Excellent board for OC. Not a problem with anything I've thrown at it. Real quality board. Very pleased with that purchase too. All in all, I'm very satisfied and hats off to Intel and ASUS. One thing Intel needs to work on is getting the heat down. This processor does need a custom water loop to exploit it. Haven't sleeved the cables yet.

It is the best CPU for Gaming
","

  Intel didn't lie this is the best CPU on the market for gaming. It's also good at a lot of other applications. But what do you expect from an 8 core 16 thread beast like this. Everyone knows this, you just have a bunch of people complaining because of the price and trying to tank the review score because they can't afford this chip. By their logic they should also be giving Ferrari a bad time because their cars value per dollar is horrible, and the cars are over priced.

Find a good sale and you'll find a good CPU upgrade
","

  First off let me say I was one that paid well over $500 for the Intel Ivy-Bridge E 4930K back in the day, so to fast forward and find myself paying just short of $500 again for the 9900K was no surprise.  However, this thing is expensive considering it's place in the market amongst same or similar performing products.  I had a Ryzen 3700x in hand before I chose the 9900K and I switched because there was very little to no overclocling headroom, too many hoops that had to be jumped through, and excessive thermal issues with the Ryzen die to deal with.  The 3700x performed very well out of the box and made for a snppy experience, but in the end it just wasn't for me.  In came the 9900K and the MSI Meg Z390 Godlike with 32GB of Corsair 3600mhz Vengeance RGB Pro memory.  The first boot was a game changer and it has been changing the way I play my games ever since.  It's fast.  Very fast.  And low and behold it is highly customizable which means it's easy to overclock.  At first I had it overclocked to the well saut after 5.0Ghz on all cores with a core voltage of 1.267 under full load and my temps sitting between 75-80c.  Then I started playing with the Ring Ratio and memory overclocking.  Now I'm sitting at 5.0Ghz all cores, 0 Avx offset, 4.7Ghz Ring Ratio, 4000mhz on the memory while still using it's cl18 timing and 1.36v, and higher than I'd like SA and IO Voltages at 1.280 and 1.200 respectively, all at 1.308v and the CPU hitting 85-90c under full load with synthetic benchmarks.  Gaming? Everything is a breeze and temps stay in the 50-65c range. Mind you I have this paired with an EVGA 2080 Ti Hybrid so I'm sure that has something to do with the gaming experience, but the high cpu usage games do seem to benefit greatly.  Overall the pc seems to be much snappier and responsive and I'm a very happy customer.  I do see the 14nm process of this cpu needing an end as there is just no more room for improvement in the way of thermal efficiency.  This chip does run hot.  Very hot! Thus the 4 stars. I have it hiding under a Kraken x72 360mm AIO and it, similarly to the Ryzen 3700x, still gets toasty even at idle although not near as bad as the Amd chip.  With the Windows Balanced power plan and C1e enabled with C States the processor will idle between 33-40c depending on room temperature.  However it takes close to nothing for it to spike into the 50-60 range for a couple seconds at a time. With the Ultimate Power plan where it stays at 5.0Ghz all the time it still sits around 40c at idle and will occasionally hit 55c with a sudden 5-15% load depending on what it is.  I am using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut as my Tim of choice.  I may way WAY down the road try to lap the IHS on the die to make for a more even distribution of the CPU cooler but for now this processor is a win.

The most powerful CPU money can buy right now for single-thread code execution.
","

  Don't get me wrong: there is nothing wrong with truck load of cores banging away at multiple threads at the same time, but for the typical desktop applications, if you profile your code you'll find things usually park on a single core... and that's where the i9-9900k shines.  Whats even more is that the i9-9900k outperforms the i9-9900x on single threads by a significant margin.  I expected the 9900x vs 9900k race to really set the X far above the K, but it did not... For multi-thread the X is about 20% faster, but for single-thread the K is about 10% faster.  Considering the 9900x costs >$1000 and the 9900k costs about $529... that makes the X a tough sell at its given price/performance point.If you're going to do a lot of video processing, something other than the K may be a better choice.  For games or other low-threading/monolithic-leaning code, the K is the King... at a good price point.

Amazing CPU, extremely pleased!
","

  I bought this for a new computer build, and matched it to a GeForce RTX 2080. I’m extremely please with how fast this is. I run two screens with various applications, in addition to gaming, and haven’t noticed any stutters or signs that the system slows down. While I may not measure the data as closely as some others, I feel like it makes the whole system run much better. Of course, I upgrade from a nearly 6 year old i7-4700 so that could also be part of the astonishing difference in speed I notice.I had an issue with my GPU a few weeks ago and had to RMA it. With the Intel UHD 620 that comes in the CPU I was able to still watch high quality videos and play a few games (albeit at low graphics) while I waited for it to return. Despite the fact that the graphics were almost unbearably rough, I was very glad that the CPU had this ability and didn’t just leave me stranded.It also makes running virtual machines smooth and actually hardly seems obvious that it’s in the virtual space and not naturally installed. I have a Corsair H115i 280mm AIO CPU cooler on it and that keeps it cool at 29-31°C during nearly all operations, and only maybe peaks to near 40°C after hours of gaming.Would absolutely recommend to everyone.

  Wish it would have specified that. I searched amazon for bark collar, a collar that does something when the dog barks. though, this would be nice since it has a remote too so i could use it when the dog chases the cat or whatever. Collar itself seems nice, remote works good.  sucks though that i have to follow her around and manually push the button when she barks. especially sucks since she runs outside on the side of the house and barks at the neighbors. basically, if i don't catch her doing that, the collar becomes useless.  have to buy a different one. 4 stars because it does seem like good quality, -1 because you knew what you where doing when you wrote this add and placed the keywords and all that.

5ghz overclock and heat

  Okay so I've been with this i9 9900k for quit some time now, and I can truly say I love it. I've been running this thing at 5ghz with for most of all stable over clock. I've been trying to tweek with some thing still though.I love how good you can stream off this one cpu while gaming, and it doesn't impact your game at all. At first I was having some problems on obs with frame stuttering, but I fixed it and it run better then ever. This i9 will smash anything you throw at it with flying colors if you have a good gpu was well. I using the 1080 ti still, imo it's not worth upgrading just yet.Also wanted so say, although this is good with steaming and gaming at the same time. I went back with my 2 pc setup so the i9 9900k is just running the game at the moment, till I start editing on this pc instead of my ryzen 1700x.Keep in mine I had to get a new water cooler, because my H100i couldn't keep up with thr heat that the i9 was throwing at it. So I went with one of the new corsair coolers H115i or something like That, all I know it was the newest one at the time.This i9 9900k will last me for a very long time because I've been running the i7 4790k from 2014 till 2019 so I'm sure this will give me more life then that one did.At the very end would I buy this again? Probably not. It's good but I'm sure the new ryzen are bang for buck.

Screams with a 2080 TI. If not the only CPU for it.

  Amazing CPU and to date one of if not the only CPU that provides a 2080 TI with what it needs to run full blast at 4k ultra wide.Some things to note. Im using a 320 aio corsair liquid cooler, and I would NOT skimp on anything less. Dont bother with air cooling. If youre going to get this cpu get at “minimum” a 320 aio.2, as with all overclocks never, ever, ever, use a built in motherboard profile to OC the cpu for you.If doing a manual OC intimidates you, then just search out a youtube video using keywords, i9900k.  maxmuis XI, settings, and OC and copy pasta the guys settings into your own bios and youll never crash, and run 5ghz easily.  It wont take you but 15 minutes.If you do something dumb and use the built in profile with a 2080 ti prepare to have stuttering in your games, even if the fps reports max the entire time. Its just how it goes. Do yourself a favor and just watch a learning video for 15 minutes.Other then that this cpu is worth every penny when looking to pair something with your 2080 TI.

Amazing Gaming/Productivity CPU - Needs Good Cooler
","

  The Intel i9 9900k is a BEAST.  I side graded to this CPU from the Threadripper 1950x and instantly saw a HUGE performance increase in both games and the Adobe Suite. Even though it has half the cores/threads (of the threadripper), the way Intel engineers their chips, there is very low latency which is very important for gaming.I run this CPU in an Asus Maximus Hero XI mobo, works very well together.Keep in mind, if you plan to use this CPU, you’re going to need a very good cooler.  I recommend an AIO (all-in-one), I have the Corsair H100i V2.  Works well, I can overclock to 5ghz with no throttling.  If you’re going to use a fan block, you most likely won’t be able to hit 5ghz, go with an AIO if you can afford it.In terms of performance, I get over 150 FPS in most AAA games (on high settings) while using the 9900k with a 1080ti and 32gb of DDR4 3000mhz RAM.If you can afford it, I would go with the i9 9900k if you’re looking for a solid workstation/gaming pc hybrid.  It is overkill for most games, but it never hurts to future-proof a system.

Only if you use the extra cores.

  Edit follow up:  After about 3 weeks of running this and my 8700K machines side by side on a cloned M.2 SSD PCIe I quite literally don't have any differences to compare against.  I can run anything on one that the other runs, and the performance is sooooo similar I can't tell which is which.  Same exact GTX 1080 in both, same memory.  There is maybe a 20 second difference with the 9900K while rendering a massive video edit, but what's 5 minutes vs. 5 minutes 22 seconds.  For perspective, my Ryzen 1950x Threadripper build did it in 3 minutes 11 seconds, and costs about $50 more.  If that helps, great.  Personally, it serves no new purpose and has no advantages over the 8700K.Original review: I don't care about gaming, an i5 built right is plenty for that.  I do video/audio production, so in this case I see a difference over the i7 8700k I've been using.  BUT, I have a Ryzen 1950X Threadripper that noticeably outruns both (and a 6850K and a 5930K on X99 chripsets).  There is only a $20 difference between this i9 and the Threadripper now at other sellers, and I can't rationalize this processor.  Any recent processor can game just fine (mine's an 8600, rarely used), and this is certainly no better than that in real time.  I ran Shadow Of The Tomb Raider for a couple hours on one, then the other, couldn't tell ANY difference.  If you use the extra cores and have an i7 I'd recommend it.  My Z390 board auto OC'd  this to 5.0 out of the box, temps are better than tolerable with water cooling.  But, if you really are performance oriented (i.e. video, large project rendering, etc.) go with a Threadripper and keep an eye on AMD for the future as well.  They're working with 7nm chips already while Intel isn't even bringing 10nm to market yet.  I've been building for over 30 years now and haven't seen a shift like this before, so even I don't know what to expect.  This processor, however is not much of a leap forward in any respect... kinda like Nvidia and RTX.  More hype than performance, stop-gap rather than a step up.  I'll end up selling this one.

  This processor is a BEAST!! Overclocks easily to 5.1mhz at 1.382volts. Gaming and rendering both are smooth and fast. The price on these is dropping significantly and now is the time to buy one. 10th gen is really not a step up in most cases. This is the king of gaming CPU’s. I have it paired with a Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Ultra which has the same VRM as the Master but does not have the I/O based CMOS reset or power switch for less money. The VRM set on the Gigabyte boards are second to none and that is the MOST important feature when powering a processor like this. The MB also features a second cpu power connector to make sure you get ample current to the CPU. It is a great matchup. Stays at 61-63 degrees under Cinebench R20 for 20 minutes scoring 5300. For cooling I am using Corsair H150i Pro with 6x LL120 fans set your in push pull in the front of Corsair crystal 680x case with 3 LL140’s as exhaust. Stays nice and cool.

Excellent CPU for gaming and computing
","

  I bought this fairly soon before AMD released their Ryzen 3 series, and admittedly, AMD's Ryzen 3 3900X sounds like a great processor for a similar price as the i9-9900K (the Ryzen has 4 more cores, 8 more threads, and sounds like it does well in benchmarks).  However, the Intel i9-9900K is a great processor.  With 8 cores and hyperthreading, the i9-9900K offers 16 threads, allowing many things to run simultaneously.  I have this processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super card (Asus ROG Strix) and a 4K monitor.  I've only played a couple games on it so far (Galactic Civilizations III and the Quake 2 RTX demo (for the Nvidia RTX 20-series cards), and they play smoothly at 4K (though the Quake 2 RTX demo seems more taxing and runs better at 1920x1080).I also sometimes run some distributed computing projects using BOINC, such as SETI@Home and World Community Grid.  SETI@Home tasks on this processor tend to take between about an hour and 15 minutes to 2 hours or so.  And with 16 threads available, BOINC will run 16 tasks at the same time, allowing plenty of work to be done.One downside of this CPU is that it can get fairly warm (from what I had read in other reviews).  I opted to get a liquid cooler for mine, a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Riig RGB 240mm.  Under a load (with BOINC), I've seen my CPU get to around 75C-81C.  When idle, I've seen mine at around 29-30C.I also sometimes do photo editing and video encoding, and this CPU helps get things done relatively quickly.Overall, this is a great workhorse CPU.

Faster than fast! XPS 8930 with oc
","

  This processor is not what I thought it would be. It is better than I could have imagined. First the packaging is awesome. Next it installed in my XPS 8930 very easily as I already had updated the bios for support. I enabled overclocking in bios and started it up. Instant first operation was 4700 mghz across all cores with dells basic oc. Now in the description the cpu states 5 ghz on one core. After downloading intel extreme tuning software I was able to quickly dial in a -.05 v core to drop the temp and bring all cores to 5 ghz. I saw an ad when debating this processor and they wanted 70$ more for across the board 5 ghz. Hmmm seems pretty shifty as this chip allowed immediate oc across all 8 cores. I am running this cpu with a EVGA aio cooler 120mm. Everywhere I read said it would not cool it and they were wrong. Although I don’t play many games that are too cpu dependent. The processor has yet to spike to 100% with about an hours worth of my version of gaming. Everything I open or play is instant and immaculate. Games that previously had a lot of tearing are crisp and spotless.  The cpu helped remove a bottleneck with my graphics card. I’d love to see this chip on a heftier motherboard in the future as my only issues with oc at 5 ghz are completely caused by the motherboard. Mostly high VRM temps and power throttling due to 4 pin tax. I played with it for quite some time and am able to maintain a continuous 4.89 ghz with no issues. I left 3 stars for value for the money because the cpu is very expensive.

Runs fast and cool
","

  In short, I've found that this processor improves gaming performance across the board, and temperatures stay low when paired with the right cooler.I purchased this processor mainly to increase flight simulation performance in X-Plane, and it delivered.  X-Plane is processor-intensive, and the i9-9900k's 5Ghz clock speed resulted in a 20% frame rate increase while using the same GTX 1080 graphics card from my old system.  My results have varied when playing other games, but all of them have shown at least some improvement.Early reviews for this processor stated that it ran hot and cooling it adequately was an issue. However,  I purchased a new Corsair H100i Pro at the same time, and it never exceeds 60 degrees under load using that cooler.  Idle temperatures are in the high 20s and low 30s.  In my experience, those are low temperatures for a high-performance processor.

A dodecahedron [sp] box with a black bag and a BIG plastic dodecahedron inside. The actual CPU could have been packaged in an ordinary envelope. For heaven's sake it's a chip.But worse, Intel doesn't even ship a basic heatsink and fan with it. They spent the money on the packaging!  I had to buy a cheap $25 fan to set things up.I've had a thirty year career in Si Valley so maybe I'm just a bit jaded with this techo-hype packaging. I was amused when Intel shipped their early NUCs in boxes that played a tune (I gave away a bunch of the boxes to some kids). Now NUCs come in plain cardboard boxes.

Let me reiterate on how this cpu can run my video editing software smoothly, can stream past 1920 x 1280, can pull open multiple tabs without any lag ( my current record is having 6 google chrome tabs open without a crash or lag for my intensive work I do), and the cpu basically carries the gpu in a way I wouldn't have ever thought of using it for. Gaming, which I throw in from time to time, doesn't downgrade at all or massively increase in general fps but can keep all of your incredibly open tabs and tasks open freely and a bit smoothly. Don't expect this to be a gpu replacement obviously. The i9-9900k is more than perfect for the amount of items and tasks I take on from a day to day basis. Buyer Beware of the cpu cooler!!

Best Gaming CPU IMO
","

  When juxtaposing the 9900k and the 2700x, you'll find that the 2700x is $200 cheaper than the 9900k, but that $200 brings a lot more to the table than a nice blue cube thing and an empty wallet. When properly cooled, the 9900k does not exceed the 65C threshold when gaming at 5GHz. I personally use the Corsair LC240E AIO Water Cooler rated for CPUs up to 230W. Saw another review where they said the Maximus XI series motherboards can't OC this to 5GHz, but I found that to be false. On both of my Maximus XI Hero (WI-FI) boards, I was able to achieve 5GHz stable with different 9900ks too. I'm unsure to the exact power draw, but at intense moments it'll reach 175w. The case is nice too, but if you order from online there's a decent chance it'll arrive in more than one piece.Some people argue that the 2700x is a CPU that can battle head-on with the 9900k. That's false. Completely. In CS:GO, a both GPU and CPU dependant game, saw a 200fps increase when standing still and up to 150fps increase during the action. The multi-threaded CPU portion works well too, seeing little to no impact when running Spotify, Chrome, and CS:GO at the same time. Cost to performance wise, the 2700x is to die for, but I have my monitor running at 240Hz and I need to keep my frames above 240, and AMD's IPS can't keep up with that, so I'll have to stick with the 9900k.Pros-wicked fast-high chance of getting to 5GHz-cool case-bragging rights-integrated? graphics?

A workhorse chip
","

  At the time of purchase. I got it on sale for $499. It was a definite upgrade from my already slow 6600K I5 (4c/4t) skylake chip. This chip proforms much better then my old sky lake build. So far, no issues with this processor. I am a heavy Editor/gaming/simulation person. So this chip helps with my needs with years to spare before showing signs of slowdowns.Drawback is that it’s a pretty penny to have a chip that an i7 can do. Bought it because the 9th gen processors got rid of hyperthreading on the i7’s which is a must for me for some programs I am using. So been contemplating between this and i7 8700K.  While the 8700K is great. I just wanted to squeeze another $120 so I don’t have to hassle replacing the motherboard sooner.

Get a good CPU cooler!
","

  This processor beats the 10900x hands down.  I have both...I put the 10900x out for the family VR system and decided to keep the 9900k for my office/gaming room.  There isn't a game I can't play on ultra high settings between this chipset and my AMD RX 5700 XT.  I don't overclock, as I just find no need to, so I cannot speak to that.  I will say that this chip runs hot...I had a MasterCooler CPU fan initially, but I ended up buying a liquid cooler instead as I was a bit concerned about how hot the chip was consistently running.  This was my first attempt at liquid cooling, but it is only a couple more steps than a CPU fan, and I can honestly say the chip runs cooler now.  Great value for the money given the new 10900x chip, as the price of the 9900k has gone down since the introduction of the 10900x chipset.  One word of caution...you will have to buy a new motherboard if you don't have an LGA 1151 socket.  I had an i7 using a 1366 socket, so I did get a new MB as well.

  I went from a Ryzen 2700x to this i9 9900k processor.  It is the best decision I made!  I was dropping frames while gaming, and every once in a while the PC would shut off with the AMD processor.

  Great processor, but I'd rather save the $25 than get what must be at least $25 of packaging with it.  I opened the box from Amazon and found a bag.  Inside the back I found a nice cardboard wrap-around.  Under this there was a lovely plastic case. Inside this there was another well-made box.  Inside that a foam cutout.  That contained a plastic case which finally contained the processor.  I can see the final box, foam cutout and plastic case.  But it doesn't need to be a $5 cardboard box wrapped in $20 of other packaging.  It looks very nice, but what am I going to do with a cardboard wrap-around with magnets holding it together?  Or a plastic case that has to be assembled just so and only holds a box of a specific size?  Or a pull string bag?  It's like a greetings card.  You're happy to get it, but then 5 minutes later you're asking yourself what you're supposed to do with it now.

  Don't get me wrong. This is one HELL of a fast chip. 100% the fastest chip out as of right now for gaming. However it's just disappointing to see Intel not being able to crack the 14nm curse. This chip is basically pushing the limits of that architecture (skylake refresh). And be prepared to either get a beefy air cooler (Noctua U12s, D15, be quiet Dark Rock Pro 4) or a 360mm AiO or go full custom water cooling because this chip needs all the cooling it can get. It's HOT. VERY VERY hot.I have mine delidded (yes I delidded because the Intel STIM can't do anything to cool this CPU), and run it bare with no IHS with a direct die frame, and it's still very hot.Despite all the negative things I've said. This is a very fast chip, and if you have the money... 100% go for it. Especially if budget isn't an issue, and you want the best. Just seeing all 8 cores and 16 threads at 5.0ghz is a sight of beauty. Best part about this chip is, if you're a streamer you can choose between NVENC or x264. I'm able to run x264 in OBS on Fast preset, and I don't notice any hiccups. This chip is a champ.Hopefully Intel can bring us a little more next year, as it seems like they wont be releasing any mainstream desktop CPU's in 2019, and the only thing we'll be getting is a 9900KS (factory binned and overclocked at 5.0ghz on all 8 cores).

Excellent CPU in a stupid ugly packaging.

  Bought this to run Revit and rendering.  Couldn't be happier as it was able to sustain OC 5ghz on all cores during rendering.  The high core speed also makes for very efficient production workflow in Revit compared to higher core count (thus lower speed) Intel Xeons and AMD Threadrippers.Started with really wanting to get an AMD Threadripper with 12 to 24 cores, but after researching benchmarks for Revit, the systems price vs performance just didn't scale with AMD.  The 8 core i9-9900k is as fast for rendering as a higher system cost 12-core AMD.  Performance for the i9-9900K in real life did not disappointOnly complaint is that Intel could have simplified the packaging and charge a few dollars less.  The tacky packaging is a waste since it cannot be reused to hold anything else.  Intel should consider firing the idiot marketing department for coming out with the dumbest packaging of 2019, not to mention committing ecological crime with a  container that goes straight to a land fill.

  Easily the best CPU I've ever put in a gaming rig. It can be overclocked, and I can push mine up to 5.0Ghz. Even runs Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 seamlessly on Ultra graphics. I use three 1080p monitors and often have a dozen different programs running at once, sometimes multiple AAA games simultaneously. This thing delivers.Make sure you buy a good cooler. I can't stress this enough. I use a top-mounted radiator cooler, but a closed liquid loop will work too if you're up for it. Stay away from fans unless you have a monstrous amount of airflow with the intake/exhaust fans. This CPU gets really, really hot. It will do anything you ask of it, but be prepared for the thermal energy involved with all that computing.Also, ensure you have a good power supply unit. I had to upgrade mine from 750 to 1200 to be able to run my i9-9900k and my 2070 Super GPU. Before, it didn't even supply enough power to turn on my graphics card. Now, I can OC both without any issue.

  This thing is fast! I was stuck on buying this or the new AMD CPU. I wanted pretty much the best CPU on the market for my needs. I wanted it mainly for gaming. This thing doesn’t dominate the new AMD line up, it’s barely beating it in some games if not tied with it. But I got this for a cheaper price than the the new AMD 3900x so I went with this to save the money. Bottom line if you buy this you won’t be disappointed, but if you want a really good CPU for production also and not just gaming I’d go with the new 3900x if you can find one it stock that is. Either would be a great choice and wouldn’t be disappointed.

Good CPU but you will need a good CPU cooling solution
","

  This is a great CPU. I am not a gamer, I use this for running scientific calculations -- these calculations run for a long time (hours at a time). I have tested this CPU under full load (all 16 threads being used), works well but it need a very good cooling solution.The first CPU fan (Thermaltake Contact Silent 12) caused overheating within minutes. The core temperature exceeded over 80 degrees Centigrade (C) and even showing at 100 degrees C (reported by lm_sensors in Linux). As a result,  the cores were being throttled significantly by the OS.After some research I got Noctua NH-D15 and it dropped the operating temprature in the range of 55-60 degrees C. This is using an open case and ambient room temperature is about 21-22 degrees. So not too bad.Overall, this CPU is good. Performs well so far in my usage. I paid over $500, so I would say this is a premium price. I would wait for the price to drop below $400 (or may be have a deal) to buy another one, since the cooling solution also costs $80+.

  There are only two problems with this i9 CPU.  The first is figuring out how to open the plastic container that holds the CPU.  Being cute doesn't necessarily make good sense.  The second is that there is no cooling fan that comes with the CPU.  It is sort of like ""Batteries not included"".

  Compared to the new Ryzen chips this is overpriced and embarrassing to admit I bought it.  However I duel boot macOS and Windows and Apple uses intel.Really, unless you are like me and HAVE to use intel, buy an AMD.  Currently this goes for almost 500, the price of AMDs 12 core.  Also, this chip is fast because Intel is overvolting it out of the box.  Unless you use a high end motherboard capable of 160 watts to run all cores at the stock turbo 4.7 you will see much less performance when used on a motherboard that follows Intel's official power specification that limits the CPU at 95 watts, most games will run full speed with the 95 watt limit, but other tasks will throttle significantly.

  I knew the i9 series was beastly, but I didn't know they were this good. I upgraded from a non-OC'd i7-4770K to a stable 4.9GHz OC'd i9-9900K and it is wicked fast. I have an OC'd GTX 1070 that I thought was pretty fast, but am now finding it to be my performance bottleneck (Mind you, I came from an i7-4770K, so I wasn't spoiled yet). I'm running a Noctua NH-D15 with their two included NF-A15 fans to keep the CPU cool. For about $70-80, I was able to squeeze out a significant amount of power because of Noctua's incredible product line, without the leakage risk of running water cooling. Overall very pleased and would recommend to anyone in the market with a mid-high budget.Edit: Got my hands on a 4 pin EPS connector for the additional 4 pin on my mobo's CPU power connection and was able to manage 5.0GHz stable at 1.315V. Without an 8 + 4 pin power connection, I was getting guaranteed crashes on Cinebench R20. I had no idea the extra power was going to change the game! If your board comes with 8 + 4, CONNECT IT!

  I upgraded from a i7-4790k and the difference is extremely noticeable. This by far has the fastest single core clock speed and the multicore performance is amazing.

They definitely get high and I'm running a 360mm Corsair radiator. It is an AIO so I imagine if you got a custom loop system it would work better than what I have but for now, it's workable. The only other gripe I have is the price. This is by far the most expensive CPU I've ever bought, 529.99 when I purchased mine, but in my opinion it's totally worth it if you're trying to future proof your build.

Mostly Bragging Rights

  I love the Intel i9-9900K processor!  However I think it is more about bragging rights than necessarily a speed bump over the 8700K.  I don't think software is fully capable of taking advantage of this CPU.  Intel has never let me down.  I have a EVGA Z390 Dark motherboard overclocked to 5.0 with 16GB G.SKILL Ripjaws DDR4 3200 RAM and SAMSUNG 970 EVO M.2 500GB SSD, Nvidia 1080 TI video card.

  This is basically the best CPU on the market today.I bought it for gaming and streaming.My current stream settings are ( StreamLabs )Encoder: ""Slow""Bit Rate: 5000kbRes: 1280x720FPS: 60You can push it to 1080 but you need to drop the encoder to something like ""Faster/fastest"" which often leads to a pixelated image.World of Warcraft has been about the game I've stream any sufficient time with the CPU.  I can say with these settings ( or similar ) you are NOT getting any stutters, frame drops, input lag, just nice gameplay and a smooth stream.Great buy if your looking to do a 1 PC stream.

  I built a new rig for a mixture of Gaming, Streaming, Audio Recording, and Photo editing. I have not overclocked this processor and I am not going to for now.

  The I9-990K is probably the best upgrade you can buy that is still in the ""affordable"" range. With a price point lower than 500$, your computer can pretty much run anything with ease. I stream, watch videos, play games, and have background processes running like Streamdeck and other things and my CPU rarely exceeds 20% (it isn't even overclocked yet).--ONE MAJOR SUGGESTION--Be sure to get a good cooler for your CPU (I have the Corsair Hydro Series H150i and it doesn't get hot even when Im doing all the above mentioned tasks at the same time).I highly recommend buying this product to bring your computer to the next level.

  Was very hesitant to upgrade to this from a Ryzen 2700X, but glad I did. For productivity and workstation tasks, there is no competition between the 2700X and 9900K. Where the 2700X was a great improvement from my i7-4770, the 9900K was yet another huge improvement from the 2700X. Ordered for $499 with a $7.50 off coupon, came out to about 520 with state tax.  Be sure you have a fast M2 SSD to pair with it, or your SSD may be the system's bottleneck. I'm using a Corsair H150i to keep it cool. My temperatures range from 24C to 69C.

  Was a bit concerned with the viability of the product, as the package arrived a bit banged up and I wasn't able to immediately test it because I didn't have all my components at the time of purchase. I recently got everything built and running after gathering all the parts and I am happy to say that this CPU works fantastically out of the box.3.6Ghz is way faster than anything I've ever used and it can handle very intensive Games and other programs at this clock speed while still running relatively cool. I've tried experimenting with getting a stable 5.0Ghz overclock, but it seems my motherboard isn't up to the task (may work in the future after some tweaks?). For now this suits my needs for my first gaming/streaming rig. Very good purchase.

  I was at an impasse. My old CPU was showing its age and I needed an upgrade to help with my projects (I use Blender, AutoCAD, ESRI ArcGIS PRO, and Adobe Suites) along with it being my gaming PC. I have a Z370 board and had a few options. Either get an 1151 socket CPU, which the best you can get is the 9900k or get a 10th gen chip, but also buy a new motherboard AND windows 10 again (and if I go that route I might as well look at AMD).The 9900K is essentially the same as the new i7-10700k, which is much cheaper, but once you count for what else you have to replace it adds up. Lowering the price of the 9900k to be closer in price to the 10700k solidified my decision. I can keep my motherboard and not have to get a new license of windows. Just update the BIOS and switch out the chip.So far it has stepped up to the task and can handle anything I throw at it. I love this new chip and the Z370 motherboard has been handling it just fine!

  Install and overclocking on this chip went extremely well. Easily hit 5 Ghz on all cores and temps never hit above 80c when stress testing. Idle speeds are between 27-30c and in games such as Battlefield V they never go over 52c. You just need sufficient cooling. I am running an x72 360mm radiator and Noctura fans. Yes this CPU is pricey and that is the reason for the 4 stars. Everyone knows that this is a hot chip. Lots of reviews are complaining about temps and they have it on air or insufficient coolers.

Excellent upgrade from 6700k
","

  This was an upgrade I didn't want to make, but my cat knocked water into my PC so here I am.  The processor itself is great and I'm in the process of tuning everything.  It runs HOT, as I'm sure many of you have already read.  So get yourself a great AIO or an excellent air cooling setup.  I'm running my rig with a 280mm AIO with two of those industrial 140mm noctua fans pushing air out, and two 200mm fans helping them along as well.Current core ratio is x47 and I idle around ~28-30C or so.  If you take care of it it'll take care of you.

Newer ryzen amd chip does more and comes with cpu fan for same price. Only bought cause amd ran out of ryzen chips to sell. I’ll just wait I guess for newer one.

  Thanks for the absolutely fabulous packaging.  It makes my PC run so much faster!!  Would a tube of thermal grease cost as much as that package?  Good god?  Are you f***** kidding me?

  For these of you asking if this will work on your Z370 motherboard, the answer is definitely yes. As long as it's a decent Z370 board.

I know this might seem little high for some of you, but what can i say, my chip is power hungry lol. Also temps are pretty okay too, 25-28c at idle, haven't seen temps go higher than 70c on some cores after few hours of gaming. Most of the time it stays mid 60s.

  This is an excellent CPU, 8 cores - 16 threads and incredible speed.  Yes it is expensive, but if you wait until supply returns to normal you can get it for around $500 (don’t pay those crazy $900 prices).  I know the Ryzen 2700x comes close in perf - but close is not better.  The 2700x is a fine proc and is a better value clearly, but it’s not “better” or faster than the 9900k.  If you want the best and have the money - the i9 9900k is the one to get.  Fantastic for gaming and for MT tasks.  This one does it all.  I’m not hating on AMD but they have nothing in this category of processors that is superior, only a better value.  Threadripper should not be directly compared head to head to this CPU.  That’s what Intels HEDT line is for.  My 9900k is being cooled by a Corsair H115i Platinum RGB and the temps are great.

  We must be careful when we read or watch reviews of CPUs by ""professional reviewers."" Nearly all reviews of CPUs will be based on a clean install of Windows with almost nothing else running in the background. This is good in that they are giving us an apples to apples comparison between CPUs, but BAD because it's apples and oranges between THEM and US.  Fortunately this is a 16t processor, so there is plenty of room for the windows scheduler to push background processes away from the threads that are running your game; like anti-Vi/Mal and LGHUB, and also secondary apps like discord and browsers. The 8t processors are great at gaming in a sterile environment, but almost no end-user plays that way. That is why this is actually a better value than a 9700k.That brings us to our next question: heat soaking. A professional review may test not only with a lighter process load, but with perfectly clean radiators and then benchmark before heat soaking occurs. A real user does not likely wash his radiator out every day. I only dust mine once every 8 months or so. If you are going to pay extra for a super high boosting CPU like this, make sure you get high end cooling, and keep it dust free. Even then, understand that 3 months into owning this, your typical 2nd hour of gaming will not be as good as the YouTube reviewer's brand new clean setup running a benchmark for 15 minutes.Should I buy it?If you are a gamer with no budget concern: hell yes! Get the best VRM motherboard and cooling, and have fun with the overclocking. It's a fun game in itself to see what you can get out of your CPU. And this is going to run your games silky smooth when paired with your 2080Ti; and since it has 16t, you don't have to close other apps when you play. Just keep that cooler clean!If you are on a budget, you should not buy this. Even as a gamer, the performance gain when this boosts compared even to the way cheaper 3700X (that comes with a cooler) is negligible. We're talking about over $630 compared to $330 with cooling. If you are on a budget, that could take you from a 2060S to a 2080S, or from SSD to NVMe, or from 1080p TN to 1440p IPS 165hz. Those things will make a HUGE difference, so if you are on a budget constraint, obviously you are going to get a better result spending on those things than on this CPU.If I truly had no budget, I'd give this 5 stars. On a budget I'd give it a 1. You're not wrong to pay for this if you can easily afford it: you're going to love it. But most of us just are not in that position, we we have to go elsewhere.

  8 cores, Hyperthreading with reasonable temps at stock speeds. When I first tested mine I had Asus Multi-core Enhancement enabled and it clocked all cores to 4.7ghz at 1.375v with temps reaching as high as 82c for a brief moment. The reason I bought this is because of the higher Turbo speeds, and I don’t like keeping processors overclocked for long periods of time.I had a 4930k that was running at 4.5ghz for a couple of years at 1.4v, and my old 2600k was clocked to 4.8ghz at 1.35v for 1 full year then 4.4ghz 1.23v for 3 more years and those processors still pass stress tests with no signs of degradation. Overclocking is great but the 9900k fills my need for high clock speeds and stability.It couldn’t do 5.1ghz, AVX offset -2, at 1.305v, LLC6. It would fail when the CPU hit around 190w.5.0ghz on all cores passed at 1.29v, AVX offset -2, LLC6, 4.2ghz cache, XMP enabled. 86c Highest temp.When I first tested the 9900k I set the core voltage to 1.30v at 5.0ghz but it passed everything, so I tried for 5.1ghz.It doesn’t overclock nearly as well as my 8700k which can do 5.2ghz and or my 8086k which can do 5.3ghz, both with AVX offset -2. It sounds like 5.0ghz is a average number for the chip.I stress test with Prime95 v26.6 and 29.4, LinpackXtreme, and Aida64. Realbench seems to pass with bad settings so I don’t use that anymore.Asus Maximus X Apex32gb G.Skill 2x16gb DDR4-3200 cl16Strix A8G GTX 1080 (Upgraded to an EVGA GTX 1080ti)Seasonic X-1250EVGA 280clcDell 1440p 144hz S2716DGRI know people are concerned with value and that’s great. Vote with your wallet. The thing is Not everyone is building a PC for the cost valuebecause Everyone has a different reason to build a PC. The value may not be that good but it’s not super terrible either. The 9900k is a Jack of All Trades but a Master of None.Now if Zen2 wipes the floor with the 9900k then I’ll regret buying it.After reading a few reviews, I'd like to point the out reasoning behind the AVX offsets and how it can help you. The AVX2 (AVX-512 2066 processors) instruction set/s consume an incredible about of power and generate an incredible amount of heat. But I'll cut straight to the point, Whatever your CPU can do (while remaining stable) at 5.0ghz while running these hardcore AVX instruction sets, with non-AVX instructions the CPU will be able to run at 5.2ghz. So far I've overclocked a 6800k with a board that has an AVX offset feature, a 7700k, 8600k, 8700k, 8086k, 7820x w/EVGA Dark, and finally the 9900k in the picture. If the CPU can pass non-AVX stress tests such as Prime95 26.6 at a speed like 5.1ghz, the CPU will pass Prime95 29.8 or LinpackXtreme at a speed like 4.9ghz. So as you can hopefully see, the AVX offset feature can be leveraged to your advantage.

  after many months of waiting i finally got my copy of this CPU.  i had read that this cpu had heat issues  from around the internet and low pci lanes.  i seriously considered going over to ryzen 2 instead but since money is no object for me i decided to give it a try anyways.  i got noctura NH-U14S single fan (not a big fan of water AIO coolers) and Tuniq TX-4 thermo compound  on stock setting with a full load  i was able to keep the cpu at around 65c  in a room that was 67f  i expect that number to go up in the summer but its still better than i had expected its thermos to be.  and i found out pci lanes are expanded with the motherboard.  i use my computer for video editing so this is a great cpu with premier pro and after effects!  im not a big gamer  so cant say much on how this cpu performs for gaming (with steam for example).  i prefer to use my computer for video editing,  other projects  and occasional emulation.  ive always been a safe over clocker so my old 5820k was no higher than 4.2ghz on all cores.  i probably wont need to over clock this cpu.Over all good cpu!  Price could be better though!

Best gaming CPU, not best value CPU
","

  This processor is the bee's knees if you want to game. It runs crazy fast and all games get at or near 144fps cap at 1440p with my setup.It overclocks like nobody's business. I finally settled at a 5.2 Ghz overclock with no AVX offset, I can do this at 1.345vcore with 3600 Mhz memory. I was able to hit higher frequency, and MUCH higher single core frequency, however, there were tradeoffs of more heat, voltage, or lower memory settings. I settled for 5.2 all cores at this point.Running this with a 560mm radiator in a tower 900 case with custom hard-tube build. In games I hit about 62c max temps, in synthetic benchmarks with AVX it'll hit 80c. Idles around ambient room temperatures, so as low as 19c idle.A suggestion I have, is get a board with good VRMs. My Aorus Xtreme doesn't even heat up pushing 5.2Ghz with just passive airflow from exhaust fans. Its expensive but one of the best boards on the market for this CPU.A final thought, people complaining constantly about this not being the best value compared to a 2700x need to understand how these things work. The best of anything is always disproportionately expensive compared to slightly worse alternatives. This is true for cars, technology, and essentially any consumer good. If you want good value then buy a midgrade alternative and be happy. If you want the best then buy the best and pay a hefty premium. Its not that complicated. You wouldn't go say a Lambo is a bad buy because a mustang is 70% as fast for 10% of the cost...

Crushing encoding performance
","

  This replaced my still cranking 3770k, and to say it's fast is an understatement! If you're expecting this to be significantly faster than a 3rd generation or newer core i7 in day to day tasks, you're going to be sorely disappointed. With an SSD drive or especially a fast NVME drive, this is about the same speed for games, productivity, web browsing and watching video.  **Assuming you have a powerful video card**Where the chip really shines is number crunching. I bought this for video encoding/gaming/future proofing my main desktop.  And for video work, it's an absolute animal!  In addition to video editing, I've been converting my 1tb+ video collection to H.265, something that wasn't feasible on the 3770k. On the 9900k, I'm encoding in faster than real time, sometimes even 2x real time depending on the source. CPU only, not using my Nvidia card to speed things up.To summarize, this chip isn't a good value if all you want is a gaming or general use desktop. Just save up for a 1080TI or better, and run a core i5/i7. It is an absolute beast for video encoding, and is a much better value than the 9900X or any other I9 processor for that task.

Great Hybrid for Gaming, Media & Workstation Development
","

  I am pretty impressed with this CPU which I recently bought two of, one of myself and my wife. I don't do much gaming but my wife does ( a lot) and she gives it two thumbs up of approval for gaming. She claims her performance was significantly boosted, gets more FPS and it able to keep up with her gaming buddies.For myself, I am a light gamer, but I haven't played a game on this yet, but since the games I last played were all well above 60fps on my old i7-4770k, I'm sure it'll work well with future games I might be interested in.I bought this for not just for some part-time gaming but for development, my little Workstation. I do a lot of coding and I also do a lot of 3D modeling and rendering using Blender.With coding, using a library such as React which compiles code, I noticed that whenever I save, it compiles so quickly that I almost don't even notice it compiling any more. That's very nice.With 3D modeling, I use Blender, and specifically for NPR (Non Photo-realistic Rendering) which means I also use Freestyle a lot (see attachment for example render style). For Freestyle rendering, it shaved about 8 seconds off total rendering time per frame, to about as quick as 4 seconds to build and render. That's a very significant improvement for animation with a lot of frames. Also, for cloth simulation, in version 2.8X, I am able to get about a constant 1.5fps at 50 Quality Steps for cloth collision, and that's a MAJOR jump up from version 2.7X on my old CPU which gave me about 0.75fps at merely 5 Quality Steps. I am able to use the Cloth Sims without spending hours trying to fine tune and re-run simulations just to see whether or not I messed up.I really do like this CPU. According to ASUS Suite 3, my CPU seems to hover at around 25.0C while idle, about 30.0C when using (such as writing this review on Amazon), and when using it in an app such as Blender, while rendering Freestyle or Cloth Sims, it'll spike up to about 40.0C for a moment before dropping back down to about 25.0C. I was able to OC to 5.4GHz just to see what it can do and it maintained a steady sub-70.0C (hovered between 45.0C and 68.0C). I am using a Corsair Hydro H55 AIO not with the intent on OC'ing, but for a very quiet box that keeps the i9 cool in its stock settings -- and it works very very well.Great CPU, I would recommend it if you're leaning towards it and can afford it, and if you have the particular uses as I described above.

It runs cool but no over-clocking used

  I upgraded my motherboard and went with the latest...so I could say I have an I9.  I came from an i7-3770 and it was doing a great job, but my gaming while good, could not run music player or utube without crashing my computer so multi-tasking was a problem.  It is not now.  I don't over-clock because I know there is a 15% safety margin the manufacturer uses and I don't want to push into the 5% margin.  I like it.  It runs cool with an air cooler, runs 30+ degrees and haven't seen any temps above 40 c.  I look at the cost over time and the $120 premium is just $20 a year over six years.  No complaints except it is not night and day from the I7-3770.  Software keeps pushing the limits needed for a processor.  4k resolution without GPU is cool, but can't do that for games, needs the GPU.

Effortless performance

  Just a phenomenal cpu.  This is probably the best upgrade Ive done, coming from an i7 7700k. I had 30 days to use and figure out if I wanted to stay with this or go with the latest AMD cpu.Work- I used to have trouble running programs that were either too complex or inefficiently coded that it led to stutters, hitches, delays or freezes.  One program that always caused massive trouble for me over the years was the Think or Swim trading platform.  I originally upgraded to the i7 7700k and it could not handle more than 2-3 chart at a time running the time and sales and L2.  Run some side charts and you could forget about trading, especially at the open when calculations need to be run at an extremely rapid pace.  I even added a total of 32gb ddr4 3400 ram and it still wouldnt run properly.  Arguably, the program is encoded really inefficiently requiring much more from the CPU than necessary.  Ive tried many different trading programs and this one caused the most trouble.  After stepping up to the i9 9900k I can now run this inefficiently encoded program on my main chart screen, with two different tickers having 4 different time frames each with its own L2 and time and sales, PLUS 15 side charts without a hitch! Also im running my browser with at least 5 tabs open and video/audio running.  Absolutely amazing.  I never thought I could get it to work like this.Gaming- even if the cpu doesnt run at 100 pct it affects the quality of the experience of the gameplay, especially for demanding games, or just poorly coded, inefficient ones.  RPGs fall into these categories. I.e., Kingdom Come Deliverance.  Video and streaming is flawless as well.Vs AMD- Performance isnt always about raw numbers, if there are too many peaks and valleys, it affects the quality of the experience.  I havent personally compared it directly to the newest AMD cpu, but having looked at the side by side comparisons, AMD cpu seems to put out better numbers for work-related applications, but clearly on the gaming side, intel is superior.  From my observation, the quality of the experience with Intel was greater because the frame rate was consistent with much less, if any micro stuttering, which you can see with the AMD chips.  As a result, Intel's presentation was more effortless and smooth.  With the AMD setup, you can see some graying/discoloring/hazy effects in demanding scenes.  It seems like AMD is an overcharged chip that experiences these dips because of that, causing a deterioration in the experience. AMD is perfectly fine for work I presume, but not for me when it comes to gaming. Intel performs like a more refined, polished product.  This is just based on my personal observation of their performance in these two different areas.Overclocking- its perfectly fine using it the way it is.  No need to overclock, but of course you can overclock it.  I run mine 16 hours a day without any problems. Top recommendation at the asking price these days.

Phenomenal CPU for a gaming, and double duty workstation rig!
","

  After taking a hiatus of several years from some of the more demanding AAA titles, I started to get back into playing some of them; the one that really made me come to the realization I needed to upgrade my PC was Battlefield 5 - in the heat of a battle in a 64 player multiplayer game, I was seeing 90-100 % cpu usage with stuttering/lagging in intense firefights - this is when I knew I needed to upgrade from my near 7 year old CPU & RAM setup.This was a upgrade from a 3570k @ 4.2ghz - while I was making a decision at the time on GPU replacement; just upgrading to a 9900k & 16gb of Corsair Ripjaws 5 3200mhz CL14 ram; it was a NIGHT and DAY difference using my old GTX 970 in Battlefield 5 - no more stuttering/frame drops.I first thought about getting a 9700k, but at the time with the $80 price difference, I decided to splurge on the 9900k - I figured back then, I didn't splurge on the 3770k when I built my last system, I would treat my self.It does need sufficient/enthusiast cooling - I paired mine with a Noctua ND-H15s. Was looking at using one of the higher end AIO's, but honestly didn't want to deal with a potential leak or point of failure.To have a 8 core 16thread CPU overclocked to 5ghz @ 1.25v on big air cooling is really impressive in my opinion, and I've been building my own gaming PC's for 15 years now.That being said, I don't know why this CPU is getting flak - it trades blows with a HEDT i9 7900x that's a year old for half the price; granted less PCIe lanes and memory, but if you are looking for a CPU as a double duty gaming/workstation machine: for the cost, it's in my opinion an amazing value..The world of technology is amazing, and no one is happy is how I will end this review.

  I upgraded from an i7-4790 to the i9-9900K and so far the difference has been astonishing! Computer boots up between 5-10 seconds and any game I've ran so far has very quick loading times. I ran my heavily modded Skyrim SE game before and after my upgrades and went from 20-30 second load windows to 10 seconds or less (sometimes 1-2 seconds flat if not loading into the overworld). Ran the Division 2 beta flawlessly with no lag at 90-120 fps. (EVGA 1080 FTW & 32gb RAM)Very good upgrade for me!

  Disclaimer: First pcI used this processor along with a lot of other top level parts and I just gotta say that this processor is an absolute beast. It can run pretty much any game that you want at 144-240fps no problem, and if you have an RTX 2080ti for low bottleneck, probably much higher. In other news, I am a math major in college and this processor can run some INTENSE calculations, not to mention it's top level performance simply as a desktop work piece. This processor will not disappoint! Side note: I use a water cooler and I would recommend a liquid cooler like that over an air cooler because this processor does run hot.

Fastest Current Gaming Consumer CPU

  Though the benchmarks show the CPU at slightly better speeds then the generation it replaces, the 9900K is a must for GPU intensive applications that require both streaming and gaming. Also I suspect it’s quite future proof as most applications are becoming more and more needful of GPU power for single applications. The CPU runs cool and is quite efficient. I would recommend it at its normal selling price. Do not pay more because it’s in demand.

  I’m using the i9900k in my laptop and have had zero issues with heat. Mind you I don’t play games, but I do utilize several 3D programs on top of rendering.I’m wondering those with heat issues if your GPU is blowing hot air back into the case. The watercooler block needs to be applied again with evenly spread thermal paste. Or perhaps it’s just a bad processor.

  I've been very satisfied with it. I haven't done any overclocking but its more than fast enough to meet my needs. I'm very heavy into gaming and twitch streaming with a single pc, though I use my graphics card with nvnec instead of this to stream. I tried to stream using this CPU with a single PC and you can max out all of your threads pretty fast, which makes your gameplay suffer.

This will also work in Z370 motherboards with BIOS updates which should already be available now; if not soon.Update 11/08/2018:Intel 9900K ReviewFastest Gaming Processor to date. Stiff competition but a great CPU nonetheless.PROs:-Fastest gaming processor to date.-Highest clock-speed eight core processor available.-Great single threaded and multi-threaded performance.-Pricing is not terrible taking in consideration of the range of the 9900K being above i7-series but at the start of the i9-series.-Best priced i9 overall and one of the best performing i9-series CPUs for the money. Having said that, see below for details.CONs:-If you're not using this primarily for gaming check out the alternatives.-Overall the price range has stiff competition from both AMD and Intel as it so happens.-Competition comes close for less: AMD Ryzen 2700X, Intel Core i7 9700K, i5 9600K, i7 8086K and i7 8700K are all great options.-If  you must have the fastest with regards to gaming, it is never the cheaper options. Although these days great alternatives abound. I waited a long time so I was ready to spend over $1K for an X-series CPU. Then along came the 9900K and I decided to give it a try. I am happy with the purchase but it is still not one of the cheaper options available.Other Thoughts:-Use a Noctua CPU Cooler or better AIO Cooler.-I recommend at the very least a Noctua NH-U14S CPU Cooler.-I chose the Noctua NH-D15 for my build. And the Corsair H150i Pro or better AIO is also an option.-Closed loop water cooling is not necessary but is always optional for extreme long-term overclocking.9900k on Maximus XI Code5ghz all core, 47 cache ratio, 3 AVX offset, MCE off1.29v, LLC 5, CPU current capability on 170%, all power limits on maxDDR4 at XMP default of 3200mhz CL14Completely stable, max package temp is 84C on an h115i ProIntel 9900K on Asus ROG Maximus XI Code with Corsair DDR4-3600 CL18 kit.5.0 GHz all cores at 1.29V.

Very nice and powerful processor that stays cool enough under full load.
","

  This is a high end processes.  It's a bit expensive, but it uses less power than many other processors in its performance class and it stays cool enough not to self destruct even under full load.  I do have a three-fan liquid cooler system mounted to the chip.  To protect the chip, I set also maximum temperature in the bios to throttle the chip if it gets too hot, but that constraint rarely occurs and doesn't seem to degrade the performance. It has eight cores, which helps since I sometimes use it for parallel processing in my programming and that speeds up certain process by a lot.

I've been buying Intel only for 35+ years, and now they come out with an identical chip that's much faster and don't even offer a reasonably priced upgrade? Thanks Intel.

If you are buying this processor, im assuming you've done your research and my review is pointless.  You know this is the best affordable processor on the market right now.  If your an Intel guy or girl, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

  Excellent CPU for OC and far better than my previous Intel 2600k. I have noticed that it uses quite a bit of power and runs hot. Be sure you have an excellent water cooling system or high-end fan cooling to distribute the heat. Adequate CPU until AMD makes something twice as fast at half the price, which they have almost done at the time of writing this review.

  Great CPU for performance and flexing on your poor friends that can't even afford an i5
