Top notch, AMD is back!
","

  I upgraded from an AMD FX-8320 to this.  I knew it would be better.  I didn't know how much better though!I built a system around this with a m.2 NVMe PCI SSD, 16GB 3200GB RAM, PNY Nvidia 1060 6GB GTX, and Asus x470 motherboard.This thing is an incredible CPU for the midrange.  VR works extremely well on it, it overclocks easily, and comes with a very good cooler with decent thermal paste so you save $50 or more right there!  Flies through my normal workloads which include web browsing, virtual machines, VR, gaming and file serving.I am not sure you could get a better performer for the money than this CPU.  5+ stars!!

Cool, fast and quiet. Great value.
","

  This was an upgrade from FX6300 CPU. I primarily play WoW and use Lightroom with my photography. I have often stayed a bit behind with performance and have finally caught up! For the first time ever, I have consistently solid framerates in games and a much less laggy photo processing experience. The cooler is fantastic. The quietest cpu fan I've ever had, and the cpu itself stays surprisingly cool (between 40 and 50c). My ONLY point of frustration came from some instability (random, long system freezes) I experienced that took me a while to troubleshoot, first thinking it was probably some sort of memory incompatibility. It ended up being an incompatibility with the Windows 10 Ryzen power plan that was installed. Switched to the regular ""Performance"" plan and its been rock solid ever since. I hope having that tidbit here helps save someone else the hassle.

Upgrading from a 10 year old PC
","

  Upgrading from a 10 year old PC which was a 2.20 Gz Dual-Core HP Pavilion to my first custom PC using this CPU as the center piece. It comes without saying that I was no longer being shackled down by the limitation of my old PC with my work flow and also the games I play multitasking with no issues. It's teamed up with an MSI Radeon RX 560 AERO ITX 4G OC128-bit 4GB graphic card.There's tons of tests on how well this CPU performs with games especially mainstream games that I do not need to go into as I'm more into video stuff so watching YouTube videos in 1080p is something else coming from 480p tho without realizing it I still find myself watching in 480p at times. Old habits. Watching 1080p HEVC videos with no lag is again something else to behold, heck, Ryzen 5 2600 isn't on his final form yet with that stuff. [Edit Oct 2020] Viewing 4K YouTube videos is also no issues either. Exceptions of course is based on your internet speed's capacity to buffer fast. Not sure about watching in 4K HEVC video tho since my monitor is only 1080p.[Edit Oct 25, 2020] Video encoding can take 30 min to 10 hours depending on the length, resolution, and which chroma sampling profile is being used, any filters will add to the encoding time. A 24 min clip with veryslow or placebo settings (with filters) are no problem speed-wise with H.264 10 bit encodes. From either 4:2:0 or 4:4:4 chroma sampling profile finishes it up quick with 18 thread encoding speed! This coming from almost an entire day's worth on my old PC's pitiful 3 threads using the same settings. Regular H.264 8 bit will use 15 threads as its max (if --thread=0 is used) and will obviously be much faster then its 10 bit counterpart. I recommend trying out tesa + subme 11 mode with either profiles if time isn't an issue.Not tested it with HEVC as of yet.[Edit - Oct 25, 2020] A few sample tests using HEVC 4:4:4 720p with veryslow and sea mode settings (no tune) of a 24 min clip took about 2-13 hours depending on the amount of filters being applied (such as heavy-duty filters like Anti-Aliasing) with max 12 numa-pools (it's kinda like --thread in H.264 but not really?) if left at its default.  The profile 8 bit, 10 bit, or 12 bit will either shorten or increase the time, However, the trade of will be higher quality such as more smoother gradients decreasing banding, color format (both at the cost of increased computation during playback) and of course the chroma sampling being used. Be mindful if your target is compatibility tho consult with the x265 documentation if interested especially with the release of HEVC 3.0 (GCC 8.3.0) which brings a number of changes such as the addition of the tune animation.To be noted all of this was done on a single Crucial 8GB DDR4 RAM which rarely hit 100% RAM output doing all of the above while encoding but I may add an additional 8/16 GB RAM in the future especially for any 1080p (and 4K) HEVC encodes, so you may want to increase your RAM if that's your target. Further note, if you watch streaming videos such as YouTube while waiting for your video to finish up be certain not to open so many browser tab. The RAM will increase closer to 100% if you've got just 8 GB, speaking from experience.I purchased this through the OutletPC seller and they were able to help me out on my concerns and questions as a first time CPU buyer though it wasn't the best of help it got the point across regarding the handling of the CPU and the chances of being a root cause when troubleshooting hardware issues getting the PC to boot properly.

AMD Continues To Impress

  Bought the 2600 to replace a 1300X and my score in Cinebench immediately DOUBLED:1300X (OC’d @ 4.0GHz) - 612cb2600 (Stock) - 1227cbAfter overclocking, it looked even better:2600 (OCd @ 4.1GHz) - 1398cbI wasn’t expecting such a big performance bump right out the gate, but this thing delivers.I’m using an X370 board, but it only took a minute to flash the bios in preparation for using the 2600.If you like low prices, the ability to overclock and great multi-threaded performance, look no further.Now that the big BIOS/Driver/Comptibility issues seem to be resolved, there’s really just no reason why you’d want an overpriced, locked chip from Intel when you could have one of these.(The 1300X is also awesome if you’re on a really tight budget.)

  I recently purchased this processor for my new PC build and it's my first AMD CPU i've ever purchased. Right out of the box it screams class with solid packaging and includes a decent/stylish cooler.Using a B450 MSI Gaming Pro Carbon AC motherboard + Corsair H100i PRO AIO liquid cooling, I manage a stable overclock to 4.0GHz at 1.25V (could probably go even lower) and temps stay around 31 deg C at idle, and around 50 deg when gaming.To give you an idea of benchmarking, I did a benchmark with User Benchmark, and thanks to the combination of my overclock, MoBo and AIO, i got a 100% Score for Gaming (Nuclear Submarine), 91% Score for Desktop (Nuclear Submarine) and 87% Score for Workstation (Aircraft Carrier). My GPU is a GTX 1070 Seahawk X, and I'm using 16GB DDR4 3000MHz Corsair RAM.(The average scores for a Ryzen 5 2600 are 88% for Gaming, 85% for Desktop and 79% for Workstation)So it literally gives me such good value as it performs way above its class.

  I had an unexpected crashing issue with my 7700k/msi gaming7 MB. Couple of flashboot restarts scared me enough to not want to turn the computer again. SO since I wasn't ready for the issue I didn't have a prebudget ready for a new $300+ CPU and probably $150-175+ on a MB. Which led me to this CPU. 6cores, 12threads, and its unlocked for your overclocking pleasure, at only $159. paired it with the $95 B450 Mortar Titanium from msi.

Initally felt ripped off, but AMD pulled through as always
","

  The ""feeling ripped off"" part was complete user error mind you. I somehow disabled or didn't turn on ""Multithreading"" for this after installing and setting up the new PC. Task manager was showing six cores, as it should, and I didnt question it. However after the recent month of playing newer games and them all being absolute CPU hogs, I started looking into why this CPU was performing worse than the FX 8350 I upgraded from. Long story short I downloaded AMD Ryzen Master (software used to monitor and/or overclock your AMD Ryzen Chips), noticed the ""multithreading"" option was turned on without realizing at the time it was off before, check Task Manager again and boom, suddenly my PC is running on 12 cores (6 cores, 6 threads)I was bewildered. Simply by downloading this program, I damn near double the potential power of the CPU.I didnt stop there though. The base speed is 3.4GHz with the BIOS automatically overclocking it to about 3.7GHz.I turned off the auto overclock through Ryzen Master and did it myself.With a Corsair H60 CPU cooler, 1.4V, I can safely run stress tests for several minutes at 4.2GHz.I could probably go higher but I am now absolutely in love with this CPU and want it to last as long as possible.Also there is literally no need for me to go higher. Streaming and gaming at the same time, even at slow encoding speeds, I never break 80% CPU load or 70 degrees Celcius.So note to new builder, make sure you enable multithreading. And if you aren't sure, just get the AMD Ryzen Master program and it will make sure it's on for you.

CPU is great, heatsink needs work! (also package fail!)

  The CPU itself is great!  I'm glad that AMD is finally starting to make a comeback (I haven't used AMD CPUs before this since the heyday of the Athlon64 x2!).  Six cores handles gaming and multitasking like a champ, and runs nice and cool.The heatsink, however, was a HUGE pain in the ass to install!  The thermal paste it came with was contaminated by debris (possibly due to damaged packaging) so I had to strip it off and supply my own thermal paste, and screwing this heatsink down onto the motherboard was exceedingly difficult (and I work on Cisco UCS blades!).  AMD needs to rethink their heatsink designs and go back to the clamping kind of heatsink.  Once installed, this cooler does well, but just installing it is a nightmare!

  I upgraded from FX 8370 and the difference and performance is crazy. From a Cinebench score of 682 score overclock 4.45 ghz 8370 to 1357 on R5 2600 is a big uplift. My gpu was being bottleneck too and now the perfomance of the gtx 1060 is even better. I would say the cooler is good if your are not going to overclock, if you do at most I got a 200 mhz increase so I used my old cooler Cryorig h7 and ordered for free the AM4 bracket and the overclock from 3.7 is now 4.10 ghz, my chip can't reach on this cooler to 4.2 sadly but at 4.10 is fine. Also be sure to at least pair it with a memory that reach 3000mhz. I am happy with the upgrade and can't wait to see how AMD with Ryzen and the next gen have in store

  I just used this processor to upgrade one of my daughters' PCs to a spec capable of running a high-end VR headset.  It replaced a 3-core AMD APU.There's a wide range of Ryzen CPUs.  They have varying numbers of cores, some support hyperthreading, some don't, some have integrated RadeonHD graphics, some don't.  You can pretty easily find sites online that will tell you how to decode AMD's Ryzen model numbers to make sense of what's what.This processor, the Ryzen 5 2600, has 6 cores at 3.9GHz that can run up to 12 simultaneous threads, but no integrated graphics.  That's fine if you want to use it with a separate graphics card, and 6 cores should be plenty for almost any normal workload.  It requires a Socket 4 motherboard.  It's a pretty good middle-of-the-road price point — good performance for almost any task, but not up to the point where your credit card flees screaming at the mention of its name and extreme gamers offer to duel you for possession of it.So there you go.  Proven AMD architecture, good bang for the buck, and comes with an almost-dead-silent CPU cooler.  Unless you're a celebrity gamer with an online handle that causes lacerations at 30 feet (or at least, want to be one), what more do you need?

Awesome Value! Check Motherboard BIOS compatibility before installing
","

  I replaced a 10 year old Core 2 Duo based system with a rig that sports the Ryzen 5 2600 at its core. After reading reviews, benchmark data, power usage data, etc. I decided I would finally give AMD a try. I used to shy away from AMD because there wouldn't be enough of a price differential in AMD's favor to justify moving to AMD. I have no regrets replacing my media server with this solution and here's why:* Power: Six cores and 65W rating means the purchase price alone will be offset by power savings in the first 18-24 months.* Speed: Six cores x 3.4GHz processing speed will drastically reduce the time to transcode videos and increase the number of clients I can support with my Plex server, while serving up all the other services I run on the box.* Value: Six cores from the competitor will run about $100 more for the CPU alone. Add the extra 30W (95W TDP vs. 65W TDP) and the power bill for the competitor equivalent will be about 35-45% higher. I also read somewhere that AMD hasn't been changing the socket requirements and forcing users to buy new motherboards with subsequent processor generations, which is yet another plus as long as this holds true (and is technically feasible).The only word of caution I have is this: If you're performing a new build and don't have any older AM4 CPUs lying around, I highly recommend checking your potential choice of motherboard for processor compatibility prior to ordering. I chose a B350 board and had to get a boot kit from AMD to facilitate a BIOS update to make this CPU work with it. This oversight cost me more time and hassle since I was unwilling to seek out or pay for alternative solutions to my issue. In the future, I'll be sure to check the vendors' support sites and make sure I buy a motherboard that supports the CPU from its ""Base"" BIOS version.My only complaint is that the hold-down screws for the heatsink have too much spring tension, which makes threading into the backing plate a bit challenging. I also ended up rotating the fan 90 degrees on the heatsink so that the logo would not obstruct the DIMM slot. I could have oriented the cooler's logo over the heatsink on the opposite side by rotating the cooler 180 degrees instead but felt it was worth the effort to ""fool-proof"" myself.I have a 3rd generation i7-based PC that I will more than likely replace with the AMD Ryzen 5 in the near future. In fact, I look forward to it.

Best CPUs for cost-to-perfomance and Gaming
","

  I purchased the Ryzen 5 2600 for my sons gaming build. I personally own the Ryzen 5 3600 in my gaming machine and knew that these Ryzen CPU's are hands down the best CPU's on the market... Many may disagree with this statement but let me explain why.Price:Ryzen CPU's are priced much lower than Intel counterparts and offer a better price/performance. Pairing a Ryzen 5 2600 with a AM4 motherboard is much less than the equivalent pairing of a Intel I5-8400 with a 1151 socket. $120 for a Ryzen 52600 or $245 for the Intel equivalent.. i'm sure you can do that math.Performance:While the I5 mentioned above technically is slightly faster in single and quad core operations, the Ryzen 5 smokes the Intel I5 due to it's hexacore configuration. Pair this with a decent overclock and you have a capable processor that comes in at half the price of the competition.The Ryzen series cpu's like a good fast ram. There are plenty of options to choose from here on Amazon but I personally went with the Patriot Viper 4 16GB (8x2) 3200 Mhz ram - https://amzn.to/31vUnPi and have not regretted this purchase one bit.Future Proof:With every few iterations of the Intel CPU's comes a new chip set and corresponding board configuration. The Ryzen series processors (Now Gen 4) are all compatible with the AM4 socket. Not only does this make building your rig easy, but there is some assurance that when you want to upgrade to the latest Ryzen CPU you will not have to buy a new board and possibly ram on top of it. Most upgrades I have seen consist of a newer gen processor and a motherboard firmware update.I am not a AMD fanboy and do enjoy seeing the performance and specs coming from the Intel processors. Saying this, I do know how to spot deals and at sub $130 this CPU is an absolute monster.Recommended pairingsPatriot Viper 4 16GB (8x2) 3200 Mhz DDR4 ram - https://amzn.to/31vUnPiMSI B450 Gaming Plus Max Motherboard: https://amzn.to/2UtQF7mAMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor - https://amzn.to/39cvPO9Thanks for reading, hopefully my review helped provide information towards your purchase.Happy Gaming!As an amazon associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

  Like the title says.  Build your own.  Why, you ask?  Very simple and I'll give you a very good example.  I had an Intel Core i5 chip on an intel Motherboard.  I've always built my own and I built that one in 2010.  With age and some other factors thrown in it started to perform very poorly.  So, feeling lazy I ordered an already to go refurbished HP Elite Desk 800 G3 with a core i7 in it.  I like to game a little (truth) and I figured I would add my pci-e video card to it and be good to go.  Not so fast, my friend.  HP's motherboards, power supplies, and cases are all propietary.  What that means is.....no upgrades unless you want to put up a serious fight and do some hours long series of modifications on the power supply to get it to work.  So, sent it back and ordered the AMD Ryzen 5, 16 Gig of DDR4 RAM, and a Asus Motherboard.  Used my old case, power supply, hard drive, video card, etc and put it together in an hour and had it up and running in two.  $400 out the door and I couldn't be happier with its performance.  I'll update on gaming performance in the next few weeks and give a final verdict then, but it seems pretty good so far.

Bought this as well as an Asrock Fata1ity x470 (Which by the way is terrible and nothing but problems and Bios is ugly and pathetic)  and 16GB ram.Now I don't know what the problem was (see Asrock above) but there was no perceivable difference (speed or otherwise) from this Ryzen 5 2600 cpu then my ooooold i5 4570. I was totally NOT impressed and disappointed. After fighting with and dealing with Asrock motherboard (which was even a bigger disappointment as I use to love Asrock but never again as they have dropped the ball and sunk to VERY low end. even their mid-high end acts like low end with their awful Bios). So after I finally get Asrock board working correctly, I was stunned at how little improvement there really was from my old cpu. Not a whole lot different and defiantly not worth the $ to improvement ratio. Sent it all back. I really really wanted Ryzen to be a great upgrade but it was just not. I do think though that if I can find a better Motherboard, Ryzen has a better upgrade path and more future proof then Intel. With Ryzen Motherboard's you can at least upgrade to several higher Ryzen CPU's before having to upgrade the whole system(like Intel). So I'll probably stick with Ryzen but wait in till I can afford a higher Ryzen cpu then a 2600. Sent it all back for now though as there was little difference between what I have now and this Ryzen 2600.

Beast for money, our go-to CPU choice these days.

  Amazing value and truly more PC than most useslrs ever actually need or have a use for.  Loves fast RAM, 3000Mhz minimum in my opinion and 3200Mhz is tits.  It'll run much faster RAM like the 3600Mhz and some 4k chips, but I didn't notice a value increase worth spending money for the faster RAM and I get better multi-tasking it seems by using that money to add more GBs of 3k or 3200Mhz.  We have 3 Ryzens in our home office, an R7 2700 and (2) R5 2600's.  Two are running 32GBs of Corsair 3000 and 1 is running 16GBs of 3200 and all run anything we throw at them.  The 2600's do everything we need and the only reason for the (1) 2700 was because of the amount of multi-tasking workload that it's used for simultaneously... But I will say that it's not the normal usage most people will throw at their PC.  When people ask me about the PC's that I build for daytraders and then start talking about their need for the fastest CPU around usually they don't realize that they're willing to blow all their money on the chip and then bottleneck themselves by cheaping out on everything else.  Skip the stupidity and marketing BS.  These are beastly chips that handle massive amounts of workload very quickly... Spend the money to get a motherboard, RAM, Drives, and GPU card that match your needs and expectations because when you eliminate bottlenecks you get an amazing value and a stellar PC.  Also, don't neglect a good case with proper airflow because heat kills electronics.  Water cooling is not needed and a good down-firing cooling fan such as the included one or even an upgraded one is all that you need, they also help you to keep the VRMs and other critical components cooled unlike when you choose the water cooling route.

Intel's I5 8400 is probably it's closest competition but the Ryzen 5 2600 clearly beats it in my opinion with the multitasking potential of this CPU. The stock cooler will get the job done but if you want to overclock it (I have no need at the time to do that) I'd invest in a better cooler or get the 2600x version

Amazing value

  Amazing cpu, really shows intel how overpriced they are, if you’re looking also at the 5 2600x this cpu is literally the same just clocked a little lower but if you have a good cooler you can still clock it just as high but be wary of the volts because the other is designed for higher volts, I run mine at 4ghz and with a coolermaster ML 240r I get 30c idle and low 40s gaming for hours.

So good I bought it twice.
","

  Bought one of these for what used to be my main rig, and another for a secondary mini-itx build, not sure which one is which anymore though.GREAT processor, all the cores/threads allow me to have a bunch of stuff open at the same time with no hiccups. Throw whatever you want to at this CPU and it will take it like a champ.As you have probably heard by now, the Wraith Stealth is a beast. I used it for months in my main rig and I'm currently using it in my mini-itx rig. It's great. Most Ryzen chips won't OC well so you probably don't need an aftermarket cooler anyways if your case has good airflow.If you want to run CPU intensive programs smoother you will need fast RAM. You can overclock your RAM with the ""Memory Try it!"" setting in your BIOS if you have an MSI motherboard. So buy fast RAM or overclock your RAM.I was so satisfied with this CPUs performance I went out and bought another to replace my Intel garbage. I couldn't upgrade to the next generation of Intel CPU's even though it was the same socket so I just ditched it and went with AMD.Best CPU on the market in terms of optimizing price and performance. You will not be disappointed!

Heart of My Workhorse of a Computer Build For Under $900
","

  As the title says, I built a beast of a computer for under $900...that's everything including the Windows License.I use Presonus StudioOne 4 Pro and Notion 6. I have an overclocked Ryzen 7 1700 in my studio. I decided to build a ""budget"" computer for my living room with this processor for editing, mixing, and mastering, so that I could do this tedious process out with my family and be a little more social.I am very happy with my decision to use this processor. I chose to go with stock cooling and not overclock this one. I paired in with my RX570 and 16mb of 2400 RAM.It has handled everything I have thrown at it without barely breaking 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The max I have thrown at so far is probably about 20 digital tracks and roughly 6 more analog tracks with many layers of effects. I use a lot of high resource VST plug ins, such as Melodyne and Kontakt.At first I was trying to get by on my ""budget"" build with 8GB of RAM. This was causing problems when I had 12 or more tracks going, but after I upgraded to 16gb, I have had no problems at all.I notice only a nominal difference between my 2 computers in regards to rendering time. I am not a ""hardcore"" gamer, but the games I do play, such as Starcraft 2, play very smooth at max settings with the R7 570.Bottom line is that you can  have an incredibly powerful computer without spending over $900 total easily, with this CPU at the heart of it. And I really like the future of the AM4 socket, as upgrading will hopefully be real easy if that is ever even needed.

Can't think of a single other chip at this pricepoint that rivals it
","

  I absolutely love this CPU.  Well done AMD!  It comes with an included cooler which is super easy to install and has pre-applied thermal paste (which considering you won't be overclocking this it just means you're saving that much more money on your build).  Great performance, and now enough time has passed where Ryzen Drivers are actually super stable.  Some would argue ""get the Ryzen 5 2600X, because it is only $16 more and has a higher base clock with a better cooler"". However, I would argue that $16 for an extremely small bump in performance could be set aside into getting an upgraded SSD, or put towards an upgrade in GPU, which would carry more impact. That having been said, Ryzen unlocked all their chipsets to be overclockable, so you're really paying $16 more for a better cooler, and a chip they claim is better at overclocking.

Best price for the performance.

  I got this for around $160, and I love it. Although I have to say that it is my first pc build, it came out great. I little problem with it. The only problem was mounting that fan that comes with it. I don’t know if that’s the problem with the motherboard or the fan. The fan is very hard to install due to the springs. You have to slowly screw in each screw one at a time, little by little, and if you mess up even slightly, you start to break the board and the screw. Other than that, this is a great CPU. I paired it with a GTX 1060 and it runs games on high generally above 100 FPS. Although AMD CPUs, especialy the Ryzen line ones, are not the best at running games, they definitely give you the best price for preformance. Just make sure to do the bios and other updates, my mouse was not compatible until I did.

very good CPU, terrible cooling
","

  I'm not sure why I did this, but when I was assembling my new computer I was feeling grouchy about thermal paste and told myself that surely AMD is selling adequate cooling for their products when used at the stock settings they were designed for.  I wasn't going to overclock so the product they are selling should work.  ...... Wrong.  I don't know why I trusted AMD, but it was absolutely the wrong call.  I powered up my computer and noted in the bios it was running hotter than I expected.  After installing windows and Steam, I finally tested it with a game released in 2012.  FAIL.  The CPU, with AMD's supplied thermal compound and cooling fan, immediately hit max temperature.really I shot myself in the foot by putting any trust in them.  I had to power down so I could disassemble, take off the cooling fan, and applied 2019 arctic silver paste.  With real thermal paste applied the CPU is now within acceptable range when gaming, but it's still a tad on the high side.  My next step if I want to reduce this would be to buy and install a different CPU cooler.Second note: the CPU cooler was awful to install. It has spring mounted screws that don't drop into the holes so it was very difficult to line up and screw in.Still, this is a great amount of processing power for the money.  Just be aware that you must also buy thermal paste, rubbing alcohol (to remove the original crap paste), and a good CPU cooler even if the only use will be at settings AMD designed and sold it for.

AMD Stepped Up Their Game

  Friends of mine urged me to go with Intel due to it being better for gaming, but I'm glad I went with AMD for my build. Paired with an RTX 2060, I have had no problem running games at 1440p 60fps+ at ultra settings.The Wraith cooler is a great bonus, though I swapped mine with an ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports Duo. With this set up, the CPU stays cool around 45c at full load.I was able to OC this CPU to 4.0GHz @ 1.3125v. I decided against a constant OC as the XFR2 was boosting to 3.9-4.1GHz on demand.If you're looking for an excellent budget CPU for gaming, this is as good as it gets.Tip: If you're looking to OC, use the Ryzen Master software to test stability before committing the changes to your BIOS.

Intel has a Fight on it's Hands with AMD's Ryzen CPUs and Included Fans
","

  Nice to see AMD is back in the CPU fight.  Great bang for the buck.  Only thing is that is is the second generation of the first Ryzen chip set.  Expect Ryzen 2 out soon - within a year or so of this writing.  And not all ""AMD Ryzen Desktop 2000 Ready"" motherboards are, or if they are, you need to update the BIOS first.  The only thing that is both a pro and a con is the thermal paste on the included fan.  It is already on the fan heat sink, and so it is easy to get your fingers in it if you don't expect it.  It also means you don't have to worry if you got enough of the stuff on the CPU, and if it is spread properly.

  so i got this cpu and was excited to move up from a 8350 which yes was a big move up. but sadly i had some mobo issues and ended up buying yet another mobo which is ok. now still to this day almost a year later after swapping many differn't parts i am pretty sure the criminal is this cpu . i can't OC my ram i have two seperate kits and both are on the list of compatability with this mobo ect. but for some reason they won't accept any OC even though they came rated for it. so this issue is this . the OC worked for like a month no problems and one day stopped working caused the system to be unstable so i checked the ram , system says rams fine which is cool. so i buy another kit does the same exact thing system becomes unstable won't even reach the boot screen again check this set all is green works fine. so now i have swapped ram and motherboard and gpu and power supply.... and hdd's and ssd's and several differn't installs of windows heck i even updated my mobo drivers.. so now it looks like its related to the cpu the last unreplaced part in this rig. only reason i would consider it is due to the fact that ryzen has a direct link to ram performance which leads me to think something is wrong with it boots just fine ect. but every now and again ill go to boot or restart my pc and i won't get my bios beep telling me everything is talking and working right so i am thinking the cpu might be faulty...but otherwise besides that it works fine so long as i don't attempt to OC ram which is sad because ryzen performance is directly link to just that ram speed. so i am missing out on performance which sucks...

Great Reputation for a Reason
","

  I've had this CPU installed in my rig for the last few months and it's been great. No regrets whatsoever. Make no mistake, this is an exceptional CPU for the value and has a great reputation for running games well. There is a reason that most of the YouTube build recommendations, specifically for the budget-oriented, will suggest this CPU for your build. Intel should take a page from AMDs book because this card surpasses anything Intel offers at a similar cost; I might even say it surpasses some of what Intel offers at a significantly greater cost.In terms of quality, stability, performance I've had no issues. I use this computer for gaming, as well as overall work/research needs. I've been able to run several modern games without any issue (along with RX570 and 16GB DDR4/3000Mhz ram). With regards to work performance, I do a lot of bioinformatic analysis and this CPU has being able to run computationally demanding software/functions via OmicsBox and various scripts in R. Some of the data files that I've used have maybe 40,000 rows of data, all with multiple columns; I've been able to open, edit without any issues. Keep in mind that this is dependent on your ram and drive too!Overclocking? I've got this card up to 3.9Ghz with the stock AMD cooler on a B450M Aorus board. I've done stress testing with this clock and it's been totally stable. I've yet to experience a single crash with this OC. Some individuals have gotten their cards up to 4.1 or 4.2 even I think...but, this is contingent on the strength of your individual card. There is some variability in the OC potential from card to card. But, I'd say most can reasonably achieve 3.9 without issue. I plan to liquid cool this CPU in the next week and will see how that affects things. Temperatures have been a little high at times, but again I'm using a stock cooler with a decent OC, often playing highly demanding games.I'd highly recommend this card to budget and maybe even non-budget minded individuals. This is a great CPU and I'd probably put more money into a better GPU before I even thought about upgrading this.

OC + Arctic Freezer Rev.2, better value over X version
","

  The short of it: For the cost of the X version, you can buy this and a ARCTIC Freezer Xtreme Rev. 2 or a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo and get a higher and consistent all cores speed. 4Ghz @ 1.35v is safe and drama free.In depth: This CPU clocked up to 4Ghz will run at a base of 3.8Ghz and all cores will boost up to 4Ghz. The stock X version will only run a base of 3.6Ghz and some cores can briefly boost up to 4.2Ghz as it is held back by it's stock clock, Spire cooler and cheap thermal grease. The 212 Evo/Freezer Rev.2 comes with better pre-applied paste so you won't have to buy separate grease. Now you could get the X version of this, and upgrade to cooler... however at that point your total cost would exceed the Ryzen 7 2700. The X version doesn't make sense.

I don't game, but for everything else the Ryzen 5 2600 has been rock solid so call me an extremely happy customer.  The upgrade path lookseasy as prices keep falling it should be a matter of simply socketing a new and even faster Ryzen chip, but I don't expect to be doing this for some years.Best buy a fast SSD with this CPU as you will not get the full speed effect if you're using a mechanical drive.

Budget CPU King 👑

  I was looking to replace my Intel i5 3570k, motherboard, & RAM with the best setup for $400. I snagged the Ryzen 5 2600, the ASUS ROG Strix B450 Motherboard, & 16GB of DDR4, which put me right at $400 before taxes.Render times and gaming are fantastic. Having 6-cores & 12 threads really helps with performance. I was going to get the Ryzen 2700 or 2700x, but the cost for the extra performance was too much. I think the Ryzen 5 2600 is the perfect price to performance CPU for most people. The Intel 8400 would end up costing more and would lose on multi-threaded applications, so for my purposes this CPU has been great. I can finally game & steam at 1440p144, although some games handle that better than others.The one thing that surprised me was how well the stock heatsink has performed. If you're only planning on light overclocking or none at all, this is not bad. I still haven't decided if I'm going to get the new Hyper 212 or go another route, but this is holding up fine so far.

  This is an upgrade to my old FX-6300 and a vast improvement. I use it primarily for video gaming and the performance in games like Total War: Warhammer 1&2 is markedly better. Load times, turn times, and frame rates are both very fast now and with the addition of an SSD and the recent turn times patch for WH2, it just flies through the turns! PC start up and shut down is also much faster.That said, while the performance of the CPU itself is fine the cooling unit isn't that great. I don't overclock or anything and my temps are fine but the thermal paste could be better and my fan was extremely noisy. I contacted Amazon about it and they sent me an entire new cooling unit free of charge, however, they initially wanted me to buy it and then they'd refund me half the cost of it. Sure, it was only like $12 but that's not the point and I told them I wasn't going to do that so they agreed to refund the full cost of the thing.I just installed the new fan today and it seems fine so far so I guess I just got a bad apple the first time.

No, I am not a communist, but I am very happy with AMD and these CPU's.

However, after making a follow-up to the status of the supposed replacement, I was informed that it was cancelled and that it is only eligible for a refund.Although I was refunded completely, including the shipping which was required for the returns, it had generated another expense which was not covered by the refund, namely having a qualified technician do necessary assessment about the computer I was building. Then, there is also the issue of the discrepancy in the value of exchange with my country's currency with that of the US Dollar which is basically lower than the time I made the purchase. The refund basically ended up less than the amount I originally paid for the item. Literally, I had just wasted my hard-earned money in this mishap.I just find it rather unfortunate having to go through so many disappointments in something that would have otherwise brought happiness to me.

  For the money, this is a really hard processor to beat. I bought it to replace an Intel Quad-core processor which was about 10 years older and which cost nearly 3 times as much back then as this one did when I bought it a few weeks ago. I have it matched up with an MSI X570-a MB, and 32gb of DDR4 memory, and I'm glad I chose to go this way. This relatively inexpensive CPU is somewhat faster than my old Pentium I-7 on operations using a single CPU core. Where it really shines is multitasking. I do a lot of video recoding, and I am currently running two seperate recoding operations as well as email and web browsing, and haven't really seen any slowdown in any of them. If I had been on my old system, it would have slowed things down to point where the browsing and email would have been unusable, and the decoding times would have increased very substantially. Needless to say, I highly recommend this CPU. I am not a gamer, so the score on it is basically borrowed from other reviewers. Check those reviews if you want more specifics regarding gaming.

  The only issue that I've had has been the Wraith Spire cooler is a bit long at the top and covers RAM slot 1 on the MSI Tomahawk B450 Motherboard.I had to remove the cooler when I wanted to add more RAM, which resulted in a bit of breakdown and setup.Other than that, overclocking it has been easy and reliable, I've set it to 3.85ghz with no temperature issue with stock cooling on the CPU. No bottlenecking on anything that I've done or played, I don't know if I've even seen it get close to 80% in task manager while running so many programs.I bought it before the new releases, so it's a little cheaper now however I'm not too upset, as there was a promotion that was going on when buying AMD products. After doing a verification through AMD's website, I was given The Division 2 on UPLAY and World War Z & a DLC on the Epic Store. Both are $60 games, not including DLC so the CPU has basically paid for itself in game time with World War Z alone.Highly recommend, although now that the new processors are out... I'd say these should be the new low-budget standard over the 1600's, and of course the 2600x is only a little more for I believe 3.85ghz native.

  First off, you need to be aware that this CPU does not have graphics support, so you will need to purchase a discrete graphics card, as the display ports on your motherboard will not function with this processor installed. If you want to use your motherboards on-board graphics, you'll need a different processor (Ryzen 5 2400G).I used this on a budget gaming build for my son (I'm not a gamer myself). Placed it on a Gigabyte B450 AORUS Pro WiFi, with 16GB RAM, 500GB M2 PCIe SSD, and an RX 580 GPU. Using the stock fan/heat-sink at stock clock speeds... it's butter smooth. I'm not talking about that hard stick of butter either... I'm talking about that smooooth creamy whipped butter!Stock fan and heat-sink are good, and look nice in my tempered glass case, so I have no plans to upgrade the cooling at this time. I understand that many have successfully overclocked this CPU using the stock cooling (which is great), but not sure my son would notice any significant real world difference in performance and/or get any additional enjoyment out of his game play, so I don't have any plans to overclock it at this time.If you're looking for a reasonably priced, capable processor and plan to use a discrete graphics card in your build... look no further.

AMD has won be back with the Ryzen 5 2600
","

  After seeing the core count, price, reviews, and sheer popularity of the CPU I had to come in and try it, and let me say I have never had a computing experience like this in so many years, the speed of being able to do multiple programs at once is breathtaking. This CPU could keep gaming with most of the general audience at even 1440p resolutions at high framerates, your GPU is really the main limit with gaming here. Get the chip for your budget PC or even your work PC. Enthusiasts know where to look but if we're talking about making a damn good computer, then YOU FOUND IT WITH THE RYZEN 5 2600

  Great product. It's the best CPU you can purchase for under 200$. On top of that, it performs great!  I build 2  PC's in 2018, one with a i7-8700K (for home and gaming) and one with a Ryzen 5 2600 (for work and gaming). Of course the Ryzen doesn't compete with the 8700k but it still performs great. Even though the i7-8700k performs better, I think I am more satisfied with my Ryzen 2600 because it performs great and I did not feel like I wasted 160 dollars for this CPU whereas the i7-8700k peforms better, but felt quite expensive.

  I'm using this CPU for a gaming/streaming computer that I built. This was the best CPU I could get for my motherboard. I've been buying AMD processors for 15 years and have not been disappointed about the value/price equation. I've been out of the market for a while but CLEARLY AMD has really stepped up their game. I had no intention to over clock this and it proved to be quite stable running Assassins Creed Odyssy for a few hours straight (with all of the Windows bloatwear  in the background). As with most CPU's today it came with it's own thermal grease precision applied (thank you AMD). Insertion into the motherboard didn't take much effort. I really wanted to get the 16 core MONSTER but in reality I don't have a need for it. I'm just a tech gear junkie like that. This is a great buy for average needs and I would totally buy it again.

I could have spent way more money and maybe not have such a good result as I have here.I highly recommend the AMD 5 2600 processor.And come Summertime I will be even happier because the AMD 5 2600 processor only uses 65 watts of power so It will not be as though I have an electric heater on my desk pumping out more heat into my already hot room.

Super Fast But gets hot

   I give this 5 stars for it runs like a champ, had to ramp up the fans to keep it from shutting down the PC. I plan to get an All in One water cooler soon. It arrived late with all the other parts I got with it, but that was due to UPS messing up my telephone numbers. However, the box was well protected and well sealed, and I cannot say enough about how stable this little processor is.Mine came stock at 3.85ghz and boosts up to 4.1ghz. I told windows to only use 70% of its power to ensure it does not overheat. I also believe due to living in a tropical island and its the summer, I have to only run low-end games but this baby can run games at 140fps and higher with the right GPU. Paired with the RX 5700XT I am impressed, but it needs cooling at high loads. I can play Black Desert Online Remastered with no issue, but Shadow of the Tomb Raider on Ultra gets super hot really fast. So pick your poison wisely if you live in a hot country like me. Also got tonnes of fans and I have great airflow, but until I get proper cooling I will play games that don't demand too much pressure.

  Muy buen procesador, un rendimiento muy bueno en comparación con los procesadores que rondan su precio. En especial para Gaming si posees una tarjeta gráfica de buen rendimiento.Recomiendo cambiar el disipador pues en de serie suele dejar calentar un poco tocando los 80° en mi caso en una habitación con temp de 29°. Por tal motivo recomendaría cualquier disipador por aire dedicado que dan unas buenas temperatura. Actualmente estoy con en hyper 212 Evo y no sube más de 64° en carga.Por último si está en tu presupuesto recomiendo ir por el 2700x que viene en picada con un futuro bastante largo por su número de núcleos adicionales.

Simple to install, great performance for gaming and for work!

  When I was ready to install this into my first PC build, I was super nervous that I would break a pin or something. I could not have been more surprised with the ease of installation with this CPU. I lined the gold triangle with where it coordinated on my B450 Tomahawk motherboard, placed it in, and moved it very lightly to insure that it was fully in place. The locking mechanism for AM4 is super simple. Way easier than Intel. You just pulled down the retention rod and lock it in.This is offered the best price per performance than anything in the Ryzen line up. I love this CPU and love that AMD has offered a product that competes with Intel. AMD's new Ryzen cards will only get better from here as the new processes for producing these CPUs become more efficient and powerful. I highly would recommend choosing an AMD CPU or Intel in today's market. They just make more sense for the average consumer and for most creators, especially when you have limits on how much you can spend on a PC build or upgrade. In today's market, and probably for the coming year (2019), it just doesn't make any sense for someone to go buy an Intel CPU given the price per performance.

  I have been using an Core i5 computer for about 4 years, and it was very fast for its time and still pretty fast, but I've been reading about how fast the Ryzen CPUs are, so I finally gave in to the temptation and built a new computer with the Ryzen 5 2600.  Well, it's just as fast as advertised, and it runs cool and quiet with the Wraith Stealth cooler. My only hiccup was that when I tried attaching the CPU cooler, it has four screws, so you have to remove the clamps that came on the motherboard.  When I did that, the metal back plate fell off, so I had to partially disassemble the computer to reach the back plate and hold it in place while I screwed the CPU cooler to it.  In hindsight, it would be better to attach the CPU and cooler to the motherboard before installing the motherboard into the computer case.  Once I got past that hiccup, everything went smoothly, and the Ryzen 5 really is faster than a Core i5, and much less expensive.

  I bought this for my first build. I didn't know anything about computers at the time, but I was simply baffled at how expensive Intel's processors were compared to AMD's. There was probably a good reason for that, but me not wanting to pay an arm and a leg for a 6 core, I chose the 2600.At 6 cores and 12 threads, while also being unlocked and coming with a good cooler for standard use, the Ryzen 5 2600 is a great bargain and performer. So far it has performed well in games and hasn't run too hot (with the stock cooler!). I cannot speak for other workloads besides gaming and general tasks, but it does those two remarkably well, often in tandem. All without breaking the bank. And this was when it was around the 160-170 dollar range, and has fallen even farther since then.And after hearing about the great success of Zen2, I will absolutely be getting another Ryzen chip for my next build. Very impressive.

Solid processor for modest gaming rig
","

  Purchased this processor for my girlfriends first gaming rig. We didn't need anything too demanding, but rather an all around workhorse. This baby, paired with a RX580, does most of what we could ask for in terms of playing some older AAA games at decent settings(if not ultra). This processor has served well for its purpose. It maintains low temps and is easy to install with the exception of the fan. The fan that it comes with requires a bit of tinkering and more pressure than you would expect to seat it properly. It literally was the bottleneck with regards to the full computer build. Alas when installed it does as advertised. If the newer Zen products didn't exist now I'd purchase it again.

  This CPU packs a heavy six-core punch at such low price. I was saving up since some time for my PC upgrade (from A8-7600). Resisted my urge when AMD launched Ryzen 1st Gen assuming that 2nd Gen would pack a lot of improvement looking at AMD's zeal.And man, they didn't disappoint. With better single thread performance and improved memory compatibility with jawdropping price I finally took the decision.Pros:1. At around $150-160, the six-core, twelve-thread monster is unbeatable.2. Breezes through multi-threaded workloads. My CPU util while gaming, which kept lurking beyond 95% previously, is now stays below 35%.3. Stock cooler (Wraith Stealth), though the smallest one in Ryzen family, does a decent job at stock speeds. 65 deg C was the max temperature I've seen under heavy workload.4. AM4 socket has long life as promised by AMD. I can easily switch to a 7nm Ryzen offering significant performance gain, in future. This would save me need of buying a new motherboard.Cons:None that I could think of.

  Great processor for an amazing value especially in 2019. 6 cores and 12 threads makes it a great gaming processor as well as a decent workstation processor. Runs games really well and doesn't get too hot even with the stock cooler. Averages about 35C idle and about 45-50C under load. If you don't like those temps, get an aftermarket cooler. Overall is an amazing cpu for the price. I paid $109.99 when I bought it.I gave it 4 stars in gaming because of one reason. As far as performance is concerned, its not the best chip. Intel Core i5 8700K or Ryzen 5 3600 would be better for gaming because they perform better than the 2600 and still match the 2600 with 6 cores and 12 threads. With performance, you could buy better.

  I have been rocking the older fx8300 chip for the past 10 years and was still getting good performance, but was feeling the pinch in certain games and even when doing video encoding. I finally broke down and got a new setup using the R5 2600 and was blown away by how much I was missing out on. FPS in games jumped by 40-50, and my videos which took around 20mins to encode now only take 9mins.  I was going to wait for the new 3000 series but I know that the drivers for this are mature enough to be stable.The only thing I can say that you might want to consider is an aftermarket cooling solution. Yes, this comes with a cooler, but is extremely under performing. I also added a evo212 and drop idle temps from 30-32c to 22-25c and turbo also can ""see"" this thermal headroom and jumps accordingly.

Great AMD brand - horrible Amazon packaging

  Not bashing AMD here as I've got two other AMD Ryzen builds and they are great. This CPU was going to be my son's upgrade from a Ryzen 3 1200 on a ASUS micto-atx mobo. BIOS are flashed to the most recent 5220 to ensure mobo life up to 3rd gen Ryzen.I'm blaming more Amazon shipping. The Amazon shipping box the CPU came in had loads of room - with no padding whatsoever so the CPU box was knocked around along with other sensitive electronics. Needless to say, I'm sure this is the reason the CPU was DOA while shipping. I also had a dual-kit of RAM shipped on the same package - and one stick is defective. I don't think it's a coincidence. Both are awaiting replacement - the RAM kit has already been acknowledge and a replacement is on the way. Still waiting to hear back on the like-for-like replacement from Amazon in regards to the CPU. Luckily Amazon's return process is smooth so I just dropped off the defective parts at Kohl's.I'll update the review once I get shipping confirmation on the new and verified it's working.

Read reviews of the wraith stealth cooler you'll see it's very hard to screw down.  I was afraid of breaking my processor and motherboard because of how hard I had to press just to screw a corner in.  And many times I screwed it in it tilted the rest of the cooler up so high it could not reach the sockets.  Took my at least an hour to screw it in.  Here is some advice just screw one corner in very very lightly then the opposite one the same and continue to lightly screw it in until you know it is secure then finish screwing it in.Overall I'm very satisfied regardless of the installation process.

  Absolutely fantastic product in terms of processing power at an affordable price, especially for building your own PC. Above and beyond expectations. However, the stock ""Wraith Stealth"" cooler that was included came defective. After installing the processor, applying the cooler was easy but something clearly did not work in terms of the spring assisted screws (on a compatible motherboard). After running the new machine the idling temperature was way too hot, at around 74 degrees.Disappointed that I had to buy a new cooler on my own a few moments ago instead of sending and waiting for a full return (and then waiting for a whole new unit) as the cooler is at fault, not the processor.Otherwise, the actual, physical processor is awesome and big kudos to AMD for making yet another spectacular product.EDIT- After purchasing the new separate Wraith Spire cooler, the CPU is running great at cool temperatures. Must have been a fluke cooler. Don't let that stop you from buying the processor! Updated to 4 stars.

It came in an eMachine (NEVER OBSOLETE!!) so I'm lucky to still have all of my fingers.Installation was (mostly) a breeze, Lift socket lever, drop in CPU minding the marked corner, push lever back down.  The ""mostly"" part is that my motherboard came with brackets to hold down the CPU cooler.  They are useless for this unit as the heat sink and fan screw in to the back plate directly.  I had to unscrew the brackets and then when screwing the new cooler on I had to juggle the back plate, cooler, and motherboard while turning the screws.  Not too hard but, still a pain in the butt.

Super impressed

  I went back & forth for weeks leading up to my purchase whether or not I'd get the 2600 or the 2600X CPU and settled on going with the 2600 and saving $50 (US).  I'm super glad I did.  I haven't taken any time to overclock the chip yet but at stock I've already tested streaming games using the CPU to do the encoding and now that I've figure out how to best setup everything for this, the CPU has been able to handle it without a single issue.  Additionally, the price vs performance of this CPU is amazing.

  Hands down best CPU value out there. This thing is seriously a beast at the price point, for mixed use cases like 1080p gaming, music production, photo editing, and intermediate video editing it is absolutely perfect, the stock cooler is nice and this thing stays REALLY cool, I haven't seen it go over 65°c yet using stock cooler in my Meshify C. Overall very impressed and very proud to see AMD pushing out great products like these. Installation of AM4 chips is a breeze and the stock cooler was also very simple to mount.

The Absolute Best Processor for Your Money
","

  This thing comes pre-overclocked. If you just drop it into the socket and turn off cool and quiet mode it will run at 3.8 GHz (0.4 GHz more than it says on the box) even if the motherboard isn't capable of OC. The ease at which this thing overclocks is absolutely crazy. There's also a little known app for the type of processor called the Ryzen Master App that will manage the processor, the voltage and the RAM overclocking. With a tweak and a restart it makes changing overclock settings really easy. The only thing you need is a motherboard capable of  overclocking a processor (for just tweaking the settings).

Best price/performance gaming CPU
","

  This replaced my AMD Athlon II X3 in my gaming machine that had soldiered on for over 7 years. This is far and above the best price/performance CPU on the market. Paired with a modest GTX 1060 3gig graphics card and 16G DDR4 3200 RAM, on an ASRock B450M PRO4 motherboard it runs everything like a champ at 1080p high or ultra without breaking a sweat. I've gone from being limited by my CPU to being limited by my GPU.Installation was easy. The CPU comes with thermal paste already applied, but I applied my own.It can be overclocked, but the overclocking software is bewildering, and I haven't had a need to overclock.The only downside is the stock cooler fan is louder than I prefer, louder than my GPU fans. Gaming with headphones on it's not notable, but I like my PCs to be nearly silent. It's possible this can be fixed by tweaking the fan controls.Pros:* Best price/performance* Easy installation* Can be overclocked* Handles 1080p gaming no problemCons:* Fan is noisier than I'd like* Bewildering overclocking software

All the CPU you will ever need.

  I bought this CPU here on Amazon for $114.99 a month ago for a build I put together for my wife.  I put the Wraith Prism cooler from my build that I got when I bought my Ryzen 3700X on her 2600 and brought the temps down 6 degrees C from the original Spire cooler that came with the 2600.  All in all, the Ryzen 5-2600 CPU is a workhorse and is all anyone would need for workstation and gaming.  It is fast and steady.  I installed 16GB of Corsair RGB 3200mhz RAM on an MSI B450 Tomahawk Max mobo and using a GTX750 Nvidia 2 GB graphics card from a previous off the shelf rig, this rig does very well.  I will eventually upgrade the graphics card as it is a bottleneck but for what my wife needs, it works fine.  I highly recommend the Ryzen 5 2600 as it is a great value chip and will serve well.

  I have nothing bad to say about this CPU due to the fact that it works great and pairs nice with my GPU! I built my gaming PC last week and wanted to wait before posting to give me time to test everything out. The parts include:MOBO: Tomahawk B450 MaxCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600GPU: MSI Geforce RTX 2060RAM: PAtriot Viper 4 Blackout series DDR4 16GB(2x8) 3000mhzSSD: Kingston 480GB A400HDD: Still waitingI am able to maintain above 90 FPS, on ultimate settings, on Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, WOW, etc... The CPU pairs well with the GPU and causes no bottle necking issues and the wraith spiral cooler that comes with it, even though standard, performs great and my temps maintain around 41c when idle and below 75c when gaming. If you're looking for a budget friendly CPU that performs great, I would suggest this one. Remember, always check your CPU or GPU when thinking about purchasing them to make sure there is no bottle necks and to see how your FPS might look. I cannot say enough great things about this CPU and, again, if your on a budget, I would suggest this!

WHY IS MY THIS PROCESSOR SO SLOW COULD IT BE THE POPUP WINDOW I GET?

  i LIKE THAT THE PROCESSOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE FASTER THAN MY RYZEN 3 I HAD BEFORE I UPGRADED TO THIS ONE. BUT I HAVE ISSUES: I have a Sunflower MB on my HP Pavilion 520- desktop.  MB is 8433 11. According to the MB manufacturer this processor AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler would work with it. . The installation was easy but I COULD NOT install the Wraith Stealth Cooler. It would not fit or work. So I had to install the original fan that came with the Ryzen 3 so now I can't overclock it. I also installed an graphic card from an old PC for now, the AMD Radeon HD 6450.. I don't use my PC for gaming, only for multitasking and Creative Cloud and social media.  I also have upgraded the memory to Mushkin Enhanced Redline 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200...a few months ago, running at 2133MHz instead of the 2666mhz.  HERE IS MY MAIN PROBLEM:  when my pc boots up, it boots up very slow and once it gets to the desktop, I can't do anything until I close the window that pops up everytime which is C:\ WINDOWS \ system32 \ windowspowershell \ v1.0 \powershell.exe. I have to click it a few times by the time it closes it. HOW DO I PREVENT THIS COMING POPPING UP EVERYTIME I REBOOT MY PC AND WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE WRAITH STEALTH COOLER THAT CAME WITH IT?

  The Ryzen CPUs are hands-down the best value you can get for the money.  Sure, the Intel CPUs are faster, but you pay through the nose for that speed.  The Ryzens are plenty fast enough... even fairly close to the Intels, but the real kicker is that the price differential is so huge now that the difference can be used to significant buf the rest of the machine... enough to buy another 8G or 16G of ram and/or a better GPU, or that SSD you always wanted.

Great balanced CPU for one who wants power but is frugal

  This is a great budget Ryzen 5 chip and I easily overclocked to 4ghz. I do use an aftermarket dual fan heatsink though. At 4ghz it's showing as 1.4 vcore which is fine for this chip. CPU on full load using all cores never gets above 70c which is under the AMD max value. Could cool it more with a lower vcore, but at 1.35 it was wonky. No complaints and many have said 1.4 is the absolute max and should be fine with proper cooling which to me makes sense. Runs 24/7 smoothly with zero problems. Running multiple benchmarks show it was a tiny bit better than the 2600x. Not bad!

  I have this paired with an EVGA GTX 1080 for gaming on dual 1440p monitors (75 Hz) and it has been a champ. It has also served me quite well for compiling on Linux. A word of caution for anyone that has bought memory using SK Hynix ICs, you probably won't ever get your memory up to 3200 MHz due to it not playing nice with Ryzen's memory controller. I have a G.Skill Trident CL16 kit I cannot push past 2933 MHz, but the proc itself with my Cryorig H7 I can hit 4.1 GHz manual OC (all core). If you don't plan on doing any overclocking, I would recommend going for the 2600X due to the higher binned chip hitting better ""turbo"" overclocking that B450/X470 boards will do automatically.

  I honestly built my new gaming system in part due to the promotional elements of both the video card I purchased and this processor. My frustration lies not in the processors performance, but in AMDs unwillingness to help me redeem my games that came as promotional items. I couldn't afford to do a complete build that could power on in one shot (I had the video card, processor and M2 SATA drive), but was waiting to save up the funds for the RAM, Motherboard, and PSU. So I contacted them directly as directed by their FAQ, which stated they could help me with an alternative means of redemption for the coupon codes (you are sent a coupon code, then you need to register with  AMDRewards, then install hardware verification software, then they send you the actual codes) if you couldn't install the software. They declined to help me after a several week back and fourth.Anyways, since that was a partial reason for purchase, and it was flat out denied me since I couldn't afford to build a complete system at the time, I'm giving the review 1 star.

  The CPU itself is a fantastic piece of work! There's no need for any liquid cooling thanks to its 65W TDP; the stock fan/heatsink is okay and does the trick.I do recommend, though, that you should search for a third party cooler. The stock cooler may interfere with RAM clearance or the motherboard's heatsink cover depending on your hardware. In my instance, it blocked off one of the RAM slots on my mATX motherboard.

  I read online forums where users said the upgrade from the Ryzen 3 1300X to this processor wouldnt really be worth the upgrade and I'd had to strongly disagree. Yes, the 1300X is an incredible value for the price and has more than enough power for most every tasks, but I saw a dramatic difference in my Video editing speeds and rendering speed after Upgrading to this 2600 CPU. The Wraith cooling fan is the same that comes with the 1300X but thus far I haven't had any issues with overheating so I don't know that its much of an issue. Having had some experience building a gaming rig or two(I'm an IT guy by trade) with the upgraded 1700, Id probably say the this CPU is the perfect bang-for-buck in the Ryzen series thus far. To get a processor this fast for around 180 bucks(at the time if purchase) is pretty insane. I'd highly recommend the Ryzen 5 2600.

  Fantastic little chip.

Installation into my motherboard was a breeze, and the stock cooler keeps it very chill and that is a fantastic plus for me as I live in a harsh desert climate. Very pleased

High pitched noise
","

  This review is mainly important for younger people. I'm in my 20's and I can hear a high pitched frequency coming from the CPU cooler fan. I keep my computer running 24/7 in my bedroom and I can hear it at night while trying to sleep, even over my noise cancelling headphones. If you keep your computer in any other room then this should not be an issue for you. I tried to have other people much older than myself and closer to my age listen in on it and none of the older people could hear it. I'm going to order a different CPU cooler, other than the noise issue everything else about this product is perfectly fine.I also made sure to identify that the fan is indeed making the noise. I took the side panel off my case and made sure it was not coming from anywhere else.

Incredible processor. Holds its own against Intel's.

  I was a little concerned when purchasing an AMD product. I, a former Intel fanboy (still am), cannot tell you how wrong I was to be even a little concerned.The 2600 is by far, one of the best value (not because I'm trying to compensate cost vs performance) when going against the likes of the 8400 and beyond.Unfortunately, the motherboard I ordered (MSI Pro B350 or something like that...) ended up damaging the pins on this CPU by having a faulty lever...During Black Friday, these things were very difficult to obtain leaving me with only being able to replace it with an 8400. Would I go back...YEP.

  Had to upgrade my old i5 3rd Gen since it's been about 5 (or 6) years I believe. This processor has 6 cores, and with the right motherboard can be easily overclocked to achieve the performance of a Ryzen 7. So far it's been running everything I throw at it with very low CPU load (which is very impressive seeing as I've been playing newer AAA titles, it usually floats around 28%-45% usage).I would buy this processor on sale, not at full price (got mine for $85 I believe). I feel with this CPUs price tag you may as well spend the extra money to get the Ryzen 7 (Just keep in mind if you get a 7, you'll need REALLY beefy parts to throw into the board).All in all, great CPU, just see if you can get it on sale so you can spend your money on a decent board and RAM.

I did however have some difficulty trying to screw the stock fan into the motherboard, i tried screwing it in the X pattern and for whatever reason after doing the opposite screw the one I previously screwed popped out forcing me to redo it...it was annoying in the end i ended applying a decent amount of pressure to make sure all four screws were in properly but be gently you don’t want to harm your motherboard.

Best value on the market
","

  Great CPU for everyday use, can handle everything I throw at it including some demanding games such as the newer Total War games along with Paradox games. While Intel CPU's may have better single thread performance and will run games better on a side by side comparison, this does not account for the fact that most people multitask while playing games or doing work projects, giving the AMD CPU a great advantage in terms of that. If you want a CPU that is both cheap and very effective at running multiple demanding programs such as for example; games+web browser+music: This CPU is for you. If you don't multitask much, however, and if you don't use programs that utilize the many cores of this CPU (such as games), maybe an Intel would be better.

A great chip for the cost

  I bought this CPU for a new build for a gaming/school work computer.  It runs wonderfully.  I have it in an MSI Arsenal Gaming Motherboard and I was able to overclock it easily right out of the box.  Just a few minutes of setup and work in the BIOS and you can easily get the most out of your chip.  I just wanted to OC to the level of a 2600X so just a modest amount, but I was using the basic cooler that came with it and I didn't want to push it.  If you want to do more serious overclocking than I would recommend an upgrade on the CPU cooling.

Wraith cooler stripped out backplate screws
","

  For the time being I'm giving this two stars simply because the CPU cooler stripped out the backplate screw holes. The screws in the Wraith cooler are woefully short and the pressure springs are so strong that once the screws are in the backplate threads they start ripping threads (no pun intended) out of the backplate. I just had to order a new cooler to replace the included cooler.If I can ever get this working then I'll update the review but it's been a nightmare so far.

  The item arrived in a very short time (remarkable, given that it was an international shipment) in perfect conditions. Though I can't say I've put it in some serious stress, for what I've seen so far it works pretty fast without overheating (which could sound obvious in November, but the room where I keep the pc is quite exposed to sunlight and thus a little hot even in winter).The box doesn't include a disk with the control panel, but it can easily be downloaded from AMD's site.Mounting the cooler isn't hard at all, but it requires a little bit of attention in the screw tightening process 'cause it could tilt a bit and thus not adhere properly. It could also be a problem of the motherboard, however, or a problem that all coolers share. I'm no expert on the matter.Anyway, great product and low price, expecially if bought discounted like I did.

I went with this processor over the 2600X primarily because I am not interesting in overclocking - I just want a fast, out-of-the-box CPU that I can install and forget about. From what I am noticing, there are absolutely no hiccups in processing power. I am using the CoolerMaster LC120E for my cooling solution and my CPU barely hits 60 degrees Celsius under game load.

I am unsure with how it is with gaming, but considering the specifications of this processor, i cannot imagine that it would have many problems if paired with a decent GPU 1060/1070

  I love the Chip, absolutely great in my Gigabyte gaming ITX mobo. The only issue was shipping to South Africa.

  I just upgraded from a A-5800k my GTX 1050TI was bottlenecked by the processor and was time to change for something better. New setup is running better than expected and with Stable FPS. The witcher 3 runs at stable 60 FPS all in hight settings it feels so good. I fully recommended.

  the only issue with this CPU is that the included cooling fan makes a whirring noise, audible if the desktop is next to you.Fixable by getting a bigger cpu fan.Otherwise, it is a pretty fast CPU

  Had 3 bent pins in the corner, so...couldn't use it. I put my thermal paste on, carefully put it into the socket only to find out that it wasn't going to go in.  Probably just a dud. I just have bad luck probably.

With the Asus X370-F Motherboard upgrade your Bios before installing this CPU.

  So, i got this CPU for the Asus X370-F MB, the MB didn’ post, it was just marking the Ram yellow light, i switched the memories, used like 4 different dims and nothing happened, i was almost sure that the problem was the motherboard then my last resort was testing the board with another CPU, i borrowed a Ryzen 7 1st gen from a friend and after mounting it, boom! it worked. So in order to use this CPU with that MB you have to update the Bios first.

Don't waste your money on the X
","

  Even if you are fairly new to overclocking or don't plan to at all, the R5 2600 is still by far the best value. You can get away with the stock cooler with a slight overclock or with the $50+ you save from not buying the 2600X, you can get an entry level 120mm AIO liquid cooler or a really beefy air cooler. Then OC to your hearts content. Look at it this way,. The 2600X is about 5% faster out of the box for 25% more money and Intel just doesn't compete in the $150 price range and there is no guarantee that your current Intel chip will work on the next generation of motherboards. AMD has promised that Ryzen chips will work across 4 generations motherboards. So future proof and plenty powerful for both AAA gaming and production. Ryzen generally speaking may loose a few hundred Mhz to Intel hear and there but don't let that scare you off. Its only a small percentage that most people would never notice unless they had an fps counter running on screen while gaming. You're money is much better served to buy this chip and then a better graphics card then an Intel chip for $200 more and a lesser GPU. AMD has really shaken up the market in a good way and left Intel scrambling. Nothing against Intel.. I also own an i5 6600K and its been a good gaming chip. But in price to performance AMD wins bigtime.

Good CPU but the stock fan...
","

  I recently bought this CPU and it works fine, but when I purchased a 144 Hertz monitor the FPS went down. I recently downloaded Ryzen Master and was checking my CPU temp. Also was thinking about overclocking but, with the stock fan the temp goes up to 85 Celsius when I'm playing MW. That's with 3.4 GHz, so I would recommend buying a different fan that will not go above 80 Celsius. I would also recommend overclocking if you are a gamer and trying to have good performance in which I would buy another fan. I would also recommend downloading Ryzen Master to check the temp and would also allow you to stress test your CPU. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel like a lot of people wouldn't know how to overclock and would just keep it at 3.4 GHz if they know nothing about computers.

I used a ryzen 5 2600 for my first ever PC build
","

  I am new to PC building, but one weekend I looked up a tutorial on how to build a PC and it seemed rather easy to me, so I took the challenge. With being on a budget I was able to build something that could handle gaming at 1080p 60fps and school work (mainly for gaming). I ended up going with the ryzen 5 instead of the ryzen 3 just so I wouldn't have to upgrade anytime soon incase I wanted to do stuff that required more of my CPU. The installation required some pressure in order for the screws to catch the thread of the backplate, but after that it was a straight forward install. I ended up swapping out the stock fan for an aftermarket one, was it necessary, probably not. The kind of task I do with it is, game and stream mostly and it still runs smoothly, no hiccups. As I'm still gettin my feet wet with PC building I can say I am happy with my decision and bang for my buck. I would recommend this to others who are on a budget and want good performance

Great CPU for the price!

  I bought this CPU after reading multiple reviews about the various mid range CPUs currently available. From what I read this CPU was by far the best deal for the price. I paired it with an Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming MB, 16 GB of G.Skill TridentZ RGB 3200 Ram and my already owned EVGA GTX 1060 3 GB video card. It has proven to be be everything I have read about it and more. I am running it at 4GHz OC'd with an Arctic 33 esports edition cooler which keeps it idling at around 29-30 C and at around 54C while gaming. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this CPU.

  My current build is an 8700k and a 2080 Ti, no doubt a performance power house, but severely lacking in the price to performance category. lol Since I have built my own rig many of my friends have reached out to me for builds and parts lists. This CPU has been in every rig/list I have thrown together in the past 6 months, and with the release of 3rd gen, the price drops on 2nd make this a no brainer for it's power. It can easily reach 4.2 ghz on water making an absolute beast for gaming. The last rig I built for my friend was a Ryzen 2600 and an RX 580 8GB, that thing can run Ark on high settings at 60+ FPS 1440p! Throw a 2600, some dual channel memory @3+ ghz, an SSD, and a midrange GPU and you have yourself a badass machine for $700-$800.

  bought this back in 2018 to replace a i5 2500k rig. Not a big boost in IPC, but multicore is better. Anything that requires the 6 cores is no problem for this processor. it took about 45 minutes to unzip a 20GB file with my 2500k. It took this processor about 3 minutes. Cool. The FPS stayed about the same in games, but I certainly noticed less stutter. Currently using this with a 1080p 144hz display with a GTX 1070, and its just perfect. I don't play the modern stuff, so its easy to reach the 144hz needed for the display.

  The stock clock speed and single thread rating is slightly higher than the Ryzen 7. I was going to try the Ryzen 7 2700, but the TDP is the same as the Ryzen 5 2600. The Ryzen 5 2600X was turned down because the TDP is almost double the 2600 for only a .3 Ghz increase. (more TDP=more CPU heat=overkill cooling needed). Plus, two more cores on the Ryzen 7 didn't seem a big deal for an extra $100. I do suggest finding a new heat-sink, CPU fan, and thermal compound. Stock provided is not worthy. I love this CPU.

Great choice for VM server

  I'm using this as the brain of my new primary Proxmox node.  It's been running 7 Linux VMs for about a month and has been solid as a rock.  Kinda wished I'd waited for the new Ryzens, but I couldn't wait after finding the Asrock Rack X470D4U.

Best CPU for a budget gaming set up

  Used this to build a gaming computer for my wife. Solid performance, very quiet with the stock fan even under synthetic stress test with a ambient room temperature of 75F. Not as fast as some Intel CPUs for purely gaming but great for the price!

  One of, if not the best bang for buck CPUs for entry level.  Won't bottleneck most GPUs and the ones that will aren't typically going to be paired with a processor at this price point anyway.  Great value, great performance!

  Ended up purchasing this processor instead of the Ryzen 5 3600 as its price dropped down to approx $120, and also because the available motherboards (B450/X470) support it out of the box. I didn't want to risk getting a board with a bios that doesn't support Zen 2 or bricking a board in my attempt to upgrade its single bios chip.I am a bit disappointed and impressed at the performance. I'm disappointed at the single-thread performance because most of my applications are not multi-thread optimised. I am however impressed when my apps are taking advantage of the multiple cores and threads; it doesn't appear to let up in completing tasks. I am actively thinking of ways to make use of the extra cores. The idle power consumption is very similar to my Core I3-6100 but it does climb to double under load.I must thank AMD for allowing me to reuse my old CPU cooler (Xigmatek Dark Knight HDT-S1283) which I installed from day one instead of the bundled Wraith Stealth cooler as I was a bit worried about the temps. It was also done with the hope of maximising the boost clocks of the CPU by keeping it cooler. At idle to low usage scenarios, it sits at 44 degrees C and it climbs to 64 degrees under full load with an ambient temp of 32 degrees Celcius.The AMD Ryzen balanced option in the power profiles runs a little faster and is a little more power-hungry than the balanced profile and becomes available when the chipset driver is installed.I wish there were more affordable motherboards available for the launch of zen 2 but this processor is pretty decent for the price. I am planning to overclock later but I don't need the extra performance right now
