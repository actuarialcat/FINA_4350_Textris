This is the best all around CPU on the market
","

  A significant amount of individuals have recommended this CPU if you're heavily multitasking, but recommend the i7 if you're gaming. If the only thing you are going to do on your computer is game, then I think that's a fair assessment. If you plan on watching 1080p60fps Youtube videos, having 20 tabs open, copying files in the background, while playing Team Fortress 2 this CPU will probably get to ~45% usage with zero significant lag.I came from an i5 and was unable to play 4K Youtube videos without my PC having serious issues. One of the first things I did was open three at once with zero performance issues. So far, the only time I've been able to get my CPU usage above 50% is when I have benchmarked encryption speeds.My only complaint would be the stock cooler because I kept having temperature issues. I guess this is an aberration, because many people have stated that the stock cooler is more than enough. Now I'm using the Noctua NH-D14 (My case cannot fit the D15), which completely ameliorated any temperature issues I was having. Shoutout to Noctua support for being awesome.Overall I'm blown away by this CPU. It is incredible to not have a CPU that will bottleneck no matter what I throw at it. Get this over the 1700x or the 1800x, this is going to be the best bang for your buck.

  What an amazing processor, bought it for gaming but also for HTML programming (overkill for this), for gaming, paired with RX580 8GB I can get 100 FPS in battlefield 1, still need to test Doom and GTA 5 but this processor provides solid performance.Packaging: It is beautiful, i will say this is a premium package, when you open it the first thing you see is the included cooler which is amazin and the processor very well packaged too.Cooler included: Excellent, i overclocked it to 3.7 GHZ in all cores with this stock cooler and with max load using CPUz it doesn't go over 70 C, also the RGB is so cool. Very silent cooler too.Performance: Solid, moves Windows 10 like a joke, you can do gaming and a lot of other tasks at the same time without losing performance thanks to the 8 cores and 16 threats.Price to performance: I will say this is the best bang for the buck, I got it for $284 which was a discount price versus an i7 8700 which is faster in gaming yes, but it also costs $400 right now, on black friday it was for around $260 so it is a great option. A lot of ppl says this is crap for gaming, well... that's not true, it is excellent, yes, intel is better but not that much (around 10%). However overall benefit from this processor is better I think, for design and gaming balance.Good job AMD (I'm not a fan boy, all my last 5 PCs were all intel, just giving a good review to an excellent product).Update 01/26/2018 After 2 months of usage O can say this is solo good, best bang for the money. Run my games over 100 fps with the RX580 with no issues maxed graphics, imagine what you can do pairing this with a 1080 TI. Highly recommended.

  I have owned Several AMD processors and Intel Processors over the years. My Ryzen 7 1700 is a lot faster than the FX 8350 I just replaced. The FX was showing its age with a MSI GTX 1060 6 gig. I paired my 1700 with a MSI X370 SLI Plus motherboard and 16gigs of G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series ram. I installed the newest bios update and overclocking was easy. The ram is running at 3200 MHZ with the Ryzen 1700 overclocked to 3.8GHZ @ 1.36 volts. My system is stable and the corsair H80i keeps temps at 38c idle and after a hour of prime95 it did not go past 75c. I am loving the speeds and multitasking my Ryzen 1700 is capable of.

I didn't win the Silicon Lottery
","

  Have this overclocked at 3.7 at 1.225v thereabouts, and it works with my RAM (Corsair Vengeance 3200) at 2933 MHz.  I forget the voltage but probably around the same ballpark of 1.225v.  That was where it was sitting before the AGESA update, so as far as I could tell that did nothing.  Can't knock a star off for that though, because at 3.7 it does everything I need it to do, gaming, streaming, and watching videos all at once.  Occasionally rendering videos.  Wish I could hit 4.0, but I still got more than I paid for.  My old locked i7 2600 was . . . well, locked at 3.4, and was worse at everything anyway even with the Ryzen at its stock 3.0.Idle temps are at 38c paired with a NZXT Kraken x62, gaming and streaming load is a comfy 50-55, and 100% CPU utilization for an hour sits at 75c dead.  If I use the stock cooler, those idles are about 5-10c more.  I'm not sure whether that's a pro for the Wraith Spire, or a con for the NZXT Kraken.  The Wraith Spire it already comes with already comes with pretty lights, but not as pretty as the Kraken's.  Is it worth spending an extra 160 dollars for a marginal increase in prettiness though?Yes.  Yes it is.[edit] I've seen mounted my radiator to the front as an intake rather than top radiator, and my temps were safe enough to push this to 3800 at 1.25v.  In fact, it constantly hit 32-35c, which is in fact the lowest it can go since the liquid inside can't get any colder (Southern California afterall).  I might try for that 4.0mhz

Best Chip I Could Have Hoped For
","

  What a great price for such a beast of a processor. I was so excited to build my first PC and also use this new chipset! I liked the performance adjustments you can seem to get out of this one over the x version, so I left the included cooler in the box and put it in storage. Then I brought out my Corsair AIO and hooked it up to my new 1700. Given a high RAM diet, this chip absolutely flies. Rendering and streaming are very quick. I can stream with OBS at 6300 bitrate at 1080p60fps with NO dips in performance ever. OBS tends to be quite CPU intensive, so this is quite nice (and luckily my internet speeds can keep up).People said this isn't as good at gaming as Intel's lineup. I'm sorry, but I just don't see it. I play all the latest AAA titles as well as competitive ESports titles at 1080p super-sampled to 4k when applicable, max graphics, etc, with no dips in performance, issues with frames, tearing, or anything but the best visuals in gaming I've experienced so far.As I mentioned earlier, this chip loves RAM. I had 16GB of 3200MHz RAM to start, but found that I needed an additional 32GB to really max out my streaming as well as my video editing. 32GB 3200MHz seems to really keep this chip happy and producing great numbers both in benchmarks and in render times, stream reliability and speed, etc.I have this overclocked to 4.1GHz on all cores. This was a trial though. I'm having an issue in the BIOS (ASUS TUF board) where I can't overclock past 3.65GHz unless I play with voltages. The problem is that if I change the voltages for the CPU literally at all, in any direction, the system reboots with a default speed of 1.5GHz on all cores. The only way to get past this was to use the Ryzen Master software. I actually had tried it earlier but thought it didn't work. Turns out it gives you an error saying the application of your overclocked failed, but it really doesn't. If you look at the output, your overclock runs just fine. The part of the program many people don't like is that every time you turn your computer on after being off, it resets to default speed. So every time I go onto my computer I must apply my OC before I game in order to have consistent gaming performance and streaming. I don't mind this at all though. Just keep it in mind when you get this chip.All in all this chip is my pride and joy. I brag about it a bit because it's better than I am in pretty much every way. Paired with a GTX 1080, my system can do just about anything. Ryzen 7 1700 is probably the best chip for the price if you're looking for the higher end as a gaming/editing/streaming usecase.

  Currently overclocked to a moderate 3.7GHz without even touching vcore and all settings set to auto and it's rock solid. I'm currently using the Wraith cooler till my 212 Hyper EVO bracket comes in and it's running around 32* Idle and  52* @ load which is impressive to say the least.I have this paired this with an MSI Tomahawk B350 MB and also don't forget to download and take advantage of AMD's free software AMD Ryzen Master. This will give you useful information and allow you to overclock directly from the desktop.I replaced an Intel i5 4690K overclocked to 4.4GHz with this Ryzen 7 1700 and what a difference in day to day tasks. I've been loyal to the Intel brand for decades but AMD got it right for the price!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: 3/24/2017It's now been a few weeks with this new Ryzen and everything is running great. I have been able to overclock this to 4GHz with only 1.385v and she screams in every benchmark. My bracket finally came in for my Cool Master Hypo EVO 212 and temps idle around the mid 40* and hit about 67* full load overclocked @ 4GHz.As far as gaming is concerned my i5 4690K was giving me a few more FPS but once I overclocked this 1700 it's now on par without the need to disable SMT. I recently switched my power profile back to balanced from performance for obvious reasons and see no downgrade in performance from doing so.You are definitely getting your bang for buck with Ryzen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: 5/5/2017Now that AMD have released new chipset drivers and the new ryzen balanced power plan this is absolutely the best running computer I've ever built.

Fantastic processor.
","

  Awesome processor. it runs at 3Ghz out of the box, but even with the included Wraith Spire cooler, it will easily overclock to 3.6Ghz. If you spend a few dozen dollars on a good third-party cooler, I'm sure you can easily reach around 4Ghz.The Wraith Spire itself is an awesome cooler. It's tiny compared to some aftermarket coolers but seems to keep the processor decently cool even during heavy load, and the small size means no difficulty fitting it in any case.Furthermore, it runs so quietly you will literally never hear it.The Ryzen processors themselves may lose out a bit in gaming performance vs equivalent Intel processors, but:1) With the terrible TIM that Intel puts in their dies, thus causing much higher temperatures, thus requiring better cooling, thus creating more noise.2) The typically higher price point of Intel, both in CPU and the motherboard (not to mention the fact that Intel makes you buy a new motherboard every single time you get a new processors, whereas AMD has promised to stick with this chipset for what is presumed to be Ryzen 2) and the fact that Intel's included heatsink are always pure garbage3) The fact that Ryzen itself is already so fast in modern games anywayI don't see why you'd not save yourself the money and the headache from the extra noise, and go Ryzen. I did, and I don't regret it for a minute. Coupled with an MSI Gaming plus motherboard and an MSI Gaming 1070ti, my entire system runs simply silent (there is NO fan noise as I'm currently typing this, and there is basically no fan noise even when I'm playing games maxed out) and everything runs at 80+ on the highest possible settings at 1080p.So unless you're gaming at 4K or absolutely must have 144fps, go for the small guy. It's time Intel got some competition again anyway.

  This cpu has incredible performance for it's price, I don't know how amd pulled it off but they did.  I used this cpu and a RX 560 to build a family member a budget pc.  They were going to spend $800 on a prefab from Best buy when I said wait a min... don't do that!I ended up spending around $820 but there were around $140 in rebates for the entire build.  It's a fantastic cpu, it's amazing at multi tasking due to amd's architectural design.  I wish I had this thing in my PC to replace my Intel i7 5820k which is a really good cpu as well but even when I push it to 5ghz it can't keep up when it comes to running multiple high end programs at once.Ryzen is King.

AMD is back with great performance/watt/price ratio. 8C/16T what more can you ask for.
","

  Just assembled my new Computer Build with this Processor at the heart of it, replacing my old AMD FX8320e 8-core processor, and have to say I love it. AMD's new Ryzen processors are what I have been waiting for them to release. Not only are they fast and efficient, but they are also priced very competitively and can once more go toe2toe with the equivalent Intel processors, but typically offer better bang for buck. I like the fact that not only did AMD bring a fast 8 Core processor out at a great price point, but they also embraced Symetrical Multithreading or SMT for short, giving the processor 16 Threads it can use. It also supports faster memory (Memory still can be a little finicky if aggressively trying to Overclock beyond DDR4-3200), and other technologies, that brings it on par or better than current processors on the market. I also like the fact it came with the AMD Wraith Spire RGB heatsink/fan, which was impressive. The Fan has a cable attachment that I could plug into my Motherboard to control the lighting. I went with the 1700 over the 1700x and 1800x, due to price was slightly better, and it was more power efficient at 65W with little difference in speed, plus X versions only add extra profiles for overclocking, that so far in reality only gain a slight advantage over the non X version. I will however move to an X CPU when I eventually build my 2nd PC using a ThreadRipper CPU. I coupled this CPU together with an ASUS ROG Crosshair VI Extreme E-ATX Motherboard, Samsung 960 EVO 250GB M.2 SSD, and Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 3600 RGB Dual Channel Memory and RM1000i Modular Power Supply, and Nvidia Geforce 1080 Ti 11GB GDDR5X Graphics Card.

And just opening up task manager and looking at the 16 threads I have available to use even though I don't use but maybe 8-10 of them normally is just awesome.

1700 is the colossus killer
","

  This is hard to write.  I used to build nothing but AMD machines back in the tbird days.  They were the plucky underdog of gaming.  All was well until I bought the fx53.  I had every type of problem known to exist to the point where I was calling amd and talking to technicians at multiple points.  They did try to help but never replaced or refunded me either.  It ran nuclear hot and eventually after two motherboards and three psu's it fried.  I was only 17 and had saved up for over a year for this chip.  Any other build to that point for me was cheaper than just that cpu.  Never touched another AMD chip until now.  Since switching to Intel I have had no issues at all, they run cool and efficient.  Here's where the problem lies.  Kaby lake is good but mediocre.  Either skylake shouldn't have been released or it should have come with the Z270 features on it already.  When I came into some scratch, I waited (not my strong suit).  I wanted to believe AMD could once again topple a colossus.  They have.  Intel isn't going anywhere and nor should they, but it has made them sweat a little and I'm grinning the whole time.  Both are amazing and loved by me, the left side of my brain loves the low tdp and numerous efficiencies.  The right side of my brain loves that AMD has created a piece of sophisticated art while yelling out the window at the top of their lungs and never letting off the breaks.  We need Intel's responsible conservative nature, but we also need AMD's belt fed .50BMG levels of insanity.  It's not always smart to fix a problem with a sledgehammer but sometimes you actually do need one.  This thing is cheap for what you're getting and only 65w tdp with eight cores and sixteen threads...It's insanity incarnate.  I have it overclocked to 3.7 on the stock wraith cooler running idles at 38c and 1.185 volts. RAM is set to 2667MHz, but will soon be able to get 3200 as patches arrive.  Unless you are an extreme enthusiast, just get this, so many bases are covered from heavy workloads and rendering to gaming and graphic design.  There is some minor teething but most are already being fixed as I write this, it's new, there will be some tweaking required but nothing difficult.  Check out level 1 tech's review as I feel they did a much better job of explaining the architecture and expectations of the new design.  Ryzen is a sign of renewed competition which breeds smarter design.  Thank you AMD for never giving up and showing us that underdogs can once again rise like a phoenix.

  I upgraded from an FX8350 and the difference in games and editing is like night and day. In photoshop I would crash the app if I had a youtube video or too many tabs open when I was using my 8350, but with this I haven't run into any of those issues. In games I have been seeing much cooler temps and jumps in performance with less stuttering and faster renders (may also have to do with updating my GPU).  I haven't overclocked this, and most complaints I have heard from it are issues with overclocking. Possibly something in place to keep speeds down to entice people to buy the more expensive models of the same chipset.  Still for my needs being games, editing, and running multiple applications at once this has been great to me. Idle temps have been around 30C, after a 5hr gaming session it only went up to 47C. To note I did not use the stock cooler. Great considering my 8350 was hitting 40-60c at idle.

  Equivalent performance (or better with an overclock) to a 6900k at a fraction of the price. Don't waste your money on an 1800x when every 1700 overclocks to at least 3.9Ghz without much fuss. Best performance per dollar CPU in a very long time. Gaming performance is the only con I can think of. Sure, the 7700k will consistently deliver 20 more FPS...

A multitasker's dream
","

  This is a fantastic CPU, but with specific use cases.From a gaming perspective, the CPU is not much of an upgrade over my old 4690k (theoretically it is slower per core). There are only a handful of CPU-bound games that can utilize many cores. In fact if all you do is play at 1080p at 60fps, this thing would be an absolute waste of money (assuming you're coming from any modern CPU made in the last several years.) This is NOT a gaming CPU for the laymen player.However, this chip has enabled a different playstyle for me and my friends. With the additional cores, I can stream my games to others I am playing with cooperatively, while watching their own stream on a separate monitor, AND recording my own game, all at the same time, while playing at 1440p@165hz, without any drop in framerate from my game. I couldn't do any of those things on my 4690k, much less all of them at once.Outside of gaming, the multi-tasking capabilities are incredible. Videos can be encoded quickly and without disrupting computer use. I haven't overclocked yet so I can't speak much of the stock cooler, besides saying it is quiet and aesthetically pleasing; from what I have read it performs admirably during overclocking.There's really only two complaints I can levy at this chip. First, there are still plenty of BIOS problems with this chip, even after months of updates. Memory support for XMP is still a nightmare, and it requires a lot of manual tweaking to get right. I understand this architecture was completely new, but I feel like a lot of these problems should have been ironed out before release.Second, I don't understand why AMD is still placing the pins on the chip, instead of the motherboard. Intel has done this for years and it makes installation much less terrifying. It sounds like Threadripper is doing away with a lot of this and adopting pins on the motherboard, but it's just sort of an odd design decision.Heatsink installation is also kinda wonky, requiring different hardware and screws depending on what heatsink you are using.

Best streaming CPU money can buy

  The best investment I've made for my streaming setup.So some background to what happened with my PC. I turned my PC on one morning and it wouldn't boot passed the BIOS. I figured it was my motherboard going bad (was running an Intel i7 5820k btw) so I ordered a new X99 motherboard from MSI. Still no booting passed BIOS even with the new motherboard. The MSI board threw an error code telling me it was my processor. Come to find out, my older gigabyte motherboard fried the 5820k. Seeing as how the 5820k were still going for close to $400 I decided to do an upgrade to Ryzen.So I went with the 1700 and can say my system is now MORE powerful thanks to the additional cores and threads I gained. The 5820k was a 6core 12 threaded processor, the 1700 is 8 cores 16 threads and it chews through literally everything. Even gaming is better on it. Running benchmarks and testing out my stream on Twitch, I drop less frames and the stream runs alot smoother than on my Intel CPU. I'll likely stick with Ryzen for the foreseeable future. Welcome back AMD!(I overclocked the 1700 to 3.6ghz for starters, have a watercooler on its way to go further)

A cool processor with lots of potential
","

  Upgraded my desktop from a $290 Core i7 860 to a $290 Ryzen 1700, great performance and temperatures. This new processor is a bit over 60% faster per clock performance than my old i7, has twice the cores, and runs at half the temperature. In web browsing and idle, it stays under 40C at 3.6GHz with the stock cooler and arctic thermal paste. When running max heat stress tests such as Prime95, it stays around 65C on all 16 threads, so I have 15C more headroom to get to 3.8GHz and above during max load tests. My old Core i7 often got into the 70-80C range for gaming, and used 180W at load (70% usage). This processor uses around around 120W at OC with max load despite twice the cores and 1GHz higher frequency. You can do space simulation games and 4K60fps video at the same time with only 50% processor usage, my temps are under 50C in that situation. I later plan to do photo stacking with images that I take of the starry skies, and so every thread is appreciated, with lots of memory and speed in order to quickly process the RAW files. I cannot say much about high end gaming performance in Windows, as I am currently using Xubuntu 17.04 and an old Radeon HD 7750.The biggest problems though with this processor are mainly from the motherboards and memory compatibility. Though as of late June, many brands of memory are at or over 2933MHz, which can bring a 10+% performance boost over 2100/2400MHz stock frequencies. The included fan is a bit difficult to install if your board is flimsy, such as my MSI B350 Mortar, but my temps show my system is operating without an issue. My board allows me to do 3.6GHz on auto voltage, which tops out at 1.2v, lots of room before I reach the 1.35-1.4V safety threshold. The Gigabyte AB350 Gaming 3 board users can safely upgrade their BIOS many times thanks to redundancy features, but it was out of stock when I ordered my system. My Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000MHz C15 memory is running at 2800MHz with the MSI v1.54 Bios, using the XMP 1 option. I plan to test 16GB of memory at 2933MHz in the upcoming days, a huge improvement over 1 stick at 2133 to boot originally.

Do yourself a favor BUY and never look back

  I have been using this non-stop since the day of the release and I'll let you know now, I have never owned an AMD product until now. I love this processor. Love it. I have always been a budget oriented bang for your buck builder, and though I spent more on this then my last 3 processor combined, this has become the best thing to ever happen to my computing life. Everything is so snappy and video rendering has been nothing but a breeze to me. I am a PC gamer as well, and honestly I have had way better luck squeezing frame rates with this CPU then any other. I overclocked my CPU to 3.5 without even having to change the voltage and I have kept it at that since changing it. I haven't even bothered trying to go farther then that because it's just been so rock solid and pleasing that I have no reason to try to milk this any more. Goodbye Intel, I'll be enjoying this CPU for yours to come. Now if only I had the money to afford an AMD gpu to round out my build.

Great processor! Would buy again!

  After about half a year I have no words other than WOW for this processor. Want to run VMs? Easy. Program? Piece of cake. Act as a cpu for a home server? Done! Game? Good enough! Multitask heavily? Why not?! Overclock? Please do!The included cooler is alright, you can even overclock a little on it, but for the types of people likely buying this thing, get a better cooler.Get faster ram too, it makes a noticeable difference. I run my ram at 2800mhz.Honestly AMD did amazing with the AM4 platform and so far it seems to be more secure than the intel SKUs which is a nice to have.AM4+ is coming soon but I would still recommend this beast.

CHECK SEGFAULT
","

  I was so excited to have my 1700 clock to 4GHz out of the box @ 1.337V. I basically won the lottery! Come to find out almost a year later, when it is time to start doing actual production work, and using GCC; It is SEGFAULTing. This chip is completely USELESS under linux. Segfault is no big deal, they'll RMA it right? WRONG.I heard they had a super easy RMA process; this could not be further from the truth. If you're unlucky enough to get a SEGFAULT chip, AMD will force you to pay the $100+ return shipping on a $300 chip. No compensation for the inconvenience; I surely won't get an equal replacement. Not to mention I have to disassemble the PC, throw  $35 of paste out the window, wait several days-weeks of downtime, and reassemble the system using new paste (good paste can be cheap, but @ 4GHz it is not.) There is absolutely ZERO consideration for the affect of this process on their customers.I have been on team red since before the launch of the Opteron in early 2000-something? I have never had much issue aside from TPM modules on intel platforms; the TPM is easily locked, however. I have preferred the lack of an embedded backdoor in my AMD chips for years, unfortunately this is no longer the case with AMD either. Very sad to see both manufacturers jump into the same boat on this one. AMD is quickly proving that you ""get what you pay for"". We will be using Intel for our critical workloads going forward, until Cyrix comes back into the fray, or a proper CPU manufacturer emerges from the dust.I wonder, does IBM still make the POWER chips? I'd definitely consider using ISA again if it meant our labs were stable and capable of any COMPUTER PROCESSING at all, something my Ryzen chip can only seem to EMULATE.TL;DR:All in all buying a Ryzen chip was a waste of $1200 for the platform; an additional $200 in replacement cost, add to that $3000+ worth of downtime on the system. At the end of the day I didn't save any money over Intel when it was all said and done, thanks to SEGFAULT, and poor quality control. If you only want to use windows, and play games, you won't notice it much aside from the occasional BSOD; but the 9400F fits the bill in that case on a much lower budget. If you're doing actual PRODUCTION workloads, or want your computer, to do computer things; look elsewhere.

  Upgrading from an old i5 2500k, I immediately noticed a difference in performance. Multitasking is so smooth now, and racing sims on Oculus Rift no longer struggle to both handle the oculus vr service and AI/Physics. Where my CPU used to be pinned at 100% it now rests at 50%.

I think more cores is better for everyone.
","

  After watching many youtubers talk about how awesome of a value the R5 1600 was, and based on current logic, it is right?, 6 good cores should be plenty for gaming and most tasks for at least another year or more. They are just now starting to use more then 4 cores now, so why not save money and pick up the 1600 over 1700. This logic seemed sound enough and I picked up a R5 1600, but before it arrived, I came across something that completely changed my mind as to the value of having more then 6 cores for mostly gaming. This quote if from the Galatic Civ 3 news page on a recent update to the game....""What core-neutral AI means is that the game will use all the CPU cores you have no matter how few or how many are on your PC,"" said Wardell.  We found that a large percentage of our players have at least 4 CPU cores and many have 6 or more.  This meant we could, literally, cut down turn times by a factor of 8 to 12 depending on the CPU. This matters because anyone who plays these types of games know that the late game can slow to a halt. It also allowed us to develop a substantially more intelligent series of computer opponents as well as create a more life-like background simulation that the players tap into.""With the current way of thinking about cpu's, it would make little to no sense to need more cores like 8 or 10 or 12 or even the massive 16 core Threadripper that is coming out unless you were doing some crazy amount of multitasking. That is because current programs and most games are only using a few cores and therefore having a few good cores with high speeds makes the best bang. What AMD clearly knows, and all of us will soon find out, is that programs are going to start making the jump to spreading out the workload to all your cpu cores more evenly, making high clock speeds not as necessary, and being able to actually take advantage of a bunch of cores for any task by spreading out the load to all the cores. This makes a 16 core 32 thread Threadripper actually make sense, since you will see a performance boost with programs who will spread out the load to all the cores.So what all this amounts to is that while a good 6 core cpu will be able to handle things just fine for a bit, it is not quite the best value when you consider the way programs are going to start utilizing more cores. I returned my 1600 and got me a 1700, because things are changing fast in the computer world, and I think those few extra cores are going to start coming in handy for everyone, not just those who are multitasking.

This thing is really fantastic
","

  I just built my first box and read about the Ryzen, liked what I read, and thought I'd give it a shot. I love it.I've never had a machine this fast. The chip isn't the only reason it's fast, but it certainly helps. It's pretty awesome doing things like converting Flac to MP3 16 files at a time. And you can do so much multitasking that you'd have to be a very heavy user to make this thing slow down. I can run Visual Studio, serve up Plex, browse the interwebs, and load up whatever I want in the background, as well as encode video simultaneously without any slowdown at all. It's fascinating really.I've overclocked it to 3.7Ghz at 1.275v on the stock cooler with no problems. I could probably tweak the voltage down a little, but I need to test further. I keep debating about whether or not to get a better cooler, but on reasonable stress testing it never gets over about 65c with the stock cooler running at 100%. Pushing it to 3.8 is too much for my chip. I'd need another cooler for that and I really have to pump up the voltage to more than I want. And running Cinebench I don't get enough difference between 3.7 and 3.8 to warrant pushing it harder. The two are within about 50 points of each other. And at 3.7 I'm getting the performance of a stock 1800x per the CPU-Z benchmark test. So I'm happy.I don't have a drawer full of chips to test this against, but based on all of the online reviewers this chip is worthy. It's well-priced, comes with a pretty solid cooler that you can overclock with, and it can handle anything you throw at it. I'm considering building a box for my wife as a Christmas gift and if I do I'm definitely using this chip. AMD is in the game!

  Got this to replace my FX8350. Chose this over the more expensive, slightly improved models because this one comes with the Wraith Spire RGB cooler.Pros:- Ryzen. Better all around than the FX series.- Wraith Spire cooler is beyond acceptable. Of course, I still recommend using your own thermal compound after cleaning the crap off of this one.- Wraith Spire cooler is RGB!! My Asus Crosshair VI Hero motherboard works so well with it!Cons- It can be difficult to figure out how to orient the cooler for the best flow of wires. This is less the product's fault and more just general design of all CPU coolers.

  What more is there to say. Got this over the 1700x with a hope of getting a good overclock for production work and save a couple dollars.Paired this with the Scythe Mugen 5 (Came with proper brackets) and hoped for 3.8Ghz OC, ended up getting 3.9Ghz at 1.33v-ish which AMD said is more than safe for 24/7 use.That combo I never see above 64c temps on 100% bench marking loads.If you are scared of overclocking look at the Asus motherboards with the 5-Way Optimization, it'll do all the work for you under safe loads so it's almost a plug and play.

  The last several builds have been i7s as AMD just didn't have the performance for the money. With they Ryzen, that all changed. I opted for the 1700 over the 1700x as it was less $, and for that $ you still get 8 physical cores, and 8 more virtualized for a grand total of 16. Kind of cool. Most of the apps / games I run take advantage of multiple cores, and so far, this CPU has barely broken a sweat, and I've pushed it hard.Paried it with an ASrRock A350 mobo, 16GB of Corsair DDR4, and M.2 drives for a substantial upgrade for much less than going with another i7 build.

The sweet spot for price and performance!

  This is an excellent processor for the price. Whenever I purchase a product I am always looking for an excellent product with the best available price to performance in its class. This chip has exceeded my expectations. I was considering a PC upgrade for some time but had not really seen any products coming from Intel for a price point that pushed me to upgrade from my overclocked AMD FX-6300. Along came Ryzen with and 8 core 16 thread CPU with performance that is very enticing considering the cost for a comparable Intel product. I have never bought an Intel CPU because AMD seems to come out with the best bang for the buck whenever I am in need of an upgrade. I found this processor to be the sweet spot after hours of research and days of contemplating. This processor will suit all of my needs for a very long time.This processor multitasks like a beast and does not break a sweat. I can play Rainbow Six Siege while encoding video with Adobe Premiere Pro with no detriment to performance. Do anything you want all at once, you don't have to pick and choose anymore! This CPU can handle it.This CPU is not that expensive and neither is the ~$100 B350 motherboard you will need to overclock it. I went with the 

ASUS Prime B350-Plus AMD Ryzen AM4 DDR4 HDMI DVI VGA M.2 USB 3.1 ATX B350 Motherboard

  . With water-cooling I was able to hit 3.9 GHz stable after stress testing, but anyone should be able to hit 3.8 GHz comfortably. Don't expect every chip to hit 4.0 GHZ or higher stable under stress. I recommend water-cooling; the stock fan that comes with this is not great for higher over-clocks.

  I'll start out by saying I prefer AMD over Intel.Having said that, I have no regrets buying this processor. I was able to OC it to 3.7GHz on the stock cooler and it still never gets hotter than 65C. I came from an Intel quad core, and I haven't found anything yet that my old processor did better.

A return to form for AMD. Killer value and great performance!
","

  AMD is surging back to the spotlight with their Ryzen processors, providing killer value with the 1700 (and 1600) for enthusiast level gaming and productivity.I've been using my 1700 for 3 months now and I've had almost no complaints about it. I'll outline a pros and cons list below.Pros:- Fast. Overclocked to 3.85 Ghz, the 1700 is more than adequate to handle any gaming experience via my GTX 1080 and 2560x1080 monitor. For 144hz or more, you may want to go elsewhere though.- Moar Cores. Self-explanatory.- Easy overclocking. Having Samsung B-die RAM and a Crosshair VI Hero motherboard definitely helps in this regard however, so your mileage will vary.- Included Wraith Spire cooler is a great option for mild overclocks of up to 3.7-3.75 Ghz at less than 1.3V. However, if you want heavier overclocking you will have to get a decent aftermarket cooler.- Ryzen Master is a handy tool to get a quick and dirty overclock, though it is certainly and obviously NOT a substitute for fine tuning an overclock via BIOS.Cons:- Power efficiency is not much of a thing anymore once overclocked and overvolted (not a problem for me but might be for others).- As I said above, if you want to game on a 144hz or faster monitor at any resolution, you would be better off going with Intel. I personally don't really care about 144hz gaming so this isn't really an issue for me.- Overclocking might have very mixed results for some people, especially if they have lower end motherboards and lower end RAM (especially Hynix. Consult QVL and Ryzen RAM compatibility threads on overclock.net and Reddit).Specs of rig:Ryzen 1700 @ 3.85 Ghz, 16GB G.SKILL TridentZ RGB 3200 CL14 RAM @ 3200 Mhz, ASUS Crosshair VI Hero, EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 FTW2, EVGA Supernova 850 P2, Crucial MX300 and 850 EVO 500GB SSDs, NZXT S340 Elite case.

  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GPU, THIS DOESN'T HAVE APU. That means your computer won't boot from onboard graphics. To be expected with most AMD chips. Great CPU, with more than enough power for most games. I barely hit 15-20% usage when I'm playing on max settings; most games it's at 5-10%. If your on a budget, this is for you. Personally wished I saved for the 2700x on sale; but this still does WAY more than I need. Just make sure you already have a dedicated graphics card; if you plan on using the video output from motherboard you will need to look towards Intel. Not a big deal because any gamer NEEDS a GPU; but might matter if your building in stages or want to be able to still boot if the GPU fails.

Currently, most games only utilize 1-4 cores, but with time goes on, more and more games will start to utilize more than four cores which this CPU will shine. It already shines with productivity programs like Adobe Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Photoshop, etc. This CPU should last for at least 2-4 years until 10+ cores become the norm.

  Using Noctua NH-D14 cooler, which is 160mm instead of the NH-D15's 165mm.Temperatures idle, 34°C with 20% fan speed.  During load, 50-65°C depending.  During stress test, max temperature of 71°C at 80% fanspeed w/ Thermal Grizzly.4,050mhz @1.375v on all 8-cores and 3466mhz RAM CL16-18-18-38-55.I won the silicon lottery with my bin.  Proud purchase.  My Ryzen 7 1700 performs on par with the 2700X with a huge overclock.Nowadays, 4ghz on 8-core is still a difficult feat to master but it seems AMD has done it with all their Ryzen processors.  Don't expect much beyond 4.2ghz on the new Ryzen 3000 series because they're binned to have GOOD SINGLE CORE TURBOS, not all-core overclocks.  4.6ghz precision boost vs 4.1ghz-4.4ghz depending on which 6, 8, 12, 16-core variant.

Perfect upgrade from an i5-2550k
","

  What an awesome CPU! I was able to get my R7 1700 up to 3.8GHz on the stock cooler. I'm so happy with that I'm forgoing a third party liquid cooling solution, as Ryzen tops out at around ~4.0GHz regardless.This was my first foray into AMD and I have to say I'm impressed. I upgraded from an i5-2550k, which was great but was beginning to bottleneck on CPU intensive games like The Witcher 3 & Battlefield One. I paired it with DDR4 Corsair Vengeance LPX (16GB @ 2666) and an X370 Gaming Pro Carbon.

   Amazing price to performance ratio and comes with its own heat sink! Usually stock heat sinks are garbage, but AMD has gone the extra mile to pack in a respectable one here. It has an LED ring that can change effects and colors with downloaded software. I use the Ryzen 1700 as my main CPU to play all types of games, watch YouTube and Netflix, and other every day tasks. I could not be happier. It keeps up with everything I throw at it! The best part is if you overclock it to 4.0 GHz, it will run the exact same way, when it comes to performance, as the Ryzen 1800x which is over $100 in value. That is just free money. Highly Recommend.

Perfect for What I Need
","

  The performance of this processor has been great so far. Up until my build in December 2017, I had only used Intel processors in pre-built PCs and laptops. A few factors drove me to getting this: the Ryzen reputation has been excellent, major Black Friday sale, it's 8-core processor, will be able to use it for years to come, and can be overclocked to higher frequencies without overheating easily. So far, I've only overclocked it to a moderate 3.7GHz. The idle temp has hovered around 18-22 degree Celsius. When it's overclocked, the temp rises to 31 degree Celsius which is not bad. I sit in a colder room in a house office, which helps. Will be interesting to see how it performs and heats during the warmer summer months.

I loved the RGB fan
","

  Upgraded from a 8320 which didn't take to any overclock over 4.3ghz, even when throwing well over 1.5 volts at it.  The 8320 was getting sluggist, and bottlenecked my rx 480 in most cpu-intensive games.  Aside from the rocky launch, upgrading to this was a night-and-day difference. When overclocked, this chip is held back by my 480, and during heavy gaming, only sips 40-50 watts of power according to the newest version od HWMonitor.  When unzipping files, usage sits at under 10%, and the whole thing is bottlenecked by my hard drive's read speed, instead of the cpu.  I'm no content creator, so I've yet to find any everyday workload that will bring the CPU-usage above 20% or so.The stock cooler is really quite impressive.  It's bulky, with a huge chunk of copper in the center right on top of the CPU. It kept my chip under 70 degrees, even at 3.7ghz.  I loved the RGB fan, which is nice to show off if you have a windowed case like me. To me it's almost funny how good this STOCK cooler is, because if THIS high-quality cooler is what just comes in the box for an AMD processor, it makes it look like Intel hates you by comparison, which isn't too far from the truth.I got it overclocked to 3.7ghz without touching voltage (stock 1.185v).  it hit 3.8ghz at 1.275v, which had the pleasant side-effect of making my 3200mhz ram stable at 2933mhz (it WOULD work at 3200mhz, but would take a few restarts to post, so I just left it at 2933 for stability's sake).  However I wasn't able to get my chip 24/7 stable at 3.9ghz as it wanted at least 1.37 volts, which made it run much too hot for my cooler (a Cooler Master Hyper T4).  From what I've heard, Ryzen seems to hit a wall at about 4ghz, so I'm pretty satisfied with 3.8ghz.  I'm sitting at R7 1800x performance at almost half the price, which is fine by me.  Even at 3.8ghz, Ryzen wipes the floor with all but the highest end Skylake and Kaby Lake chips, and comes biting at the heels of the 6900k.  Which is unbelievable considering Ryzen's low price tag.As far as the problems go, there are really only two main ones.  It's already been a month or so, and it doesn't look like RAM speeds will be going up for Ryzen any time soon.  At least not with a simple BIOS update.  You should still keep your BIOS up to date, but I think the RAM speed problem might run deeper than the BIOS.  Either way, with my few hours of overclocking, I've managed to get 2933mhz RAM, which is about where speeds should have been to begin with, so my experience hasn't changed much.The second problem stems from Ryzen's design.  These 8-core chips are, in very simple terms, two quad-core 'core complexes' stuck together.  And if reports are to be believed, these two complexes have problems communicating between one another, so if two co-dependant threads are stuck by windows on separate complexes, performance takes a rather large hit.  I personally haven't had any noticeable problems with this, but if it IS true, then I'd have to wag my finger at AMD for having such a fundamental flaw in the architecture.I would list the gaming performance as a problem, but nobody buys a $350+ processor just to game at 1080p on low settings, and this CPU is far from bottlenecking my RX 480, even with it's 1400mhz overclock.  So this chip still gets a big thumbs-up from me in gaming.Overall, I think AMD has really hit it out of the park with Ryzen.  While it may fall behind Intel's Skylake and Kaby Lake in single-threaded performance, it's no Bulldozer, and can keep up well where it counts.

AMD is smashing it with Ryzen. Worth the $$$ for sure, no doubt.
","

  Been using the last 4 gens of AMD in a DAW/gaming rig. AMD has always been underrated and a good value imo. Sure, they didn't hit benchmarks like the top Intel stuff especially for single core butt I have never really had an issue with them in a DAW using Cubase. For gaming they also seemed fine even if they didn't hit the top FPS like an intel.Upgraded from FX 8350. R7 1700 destroys it all around, its not even close.Well..... this new Ryzen gen smashes everything imo. The studio DAW has dual Xeon, I don't see any difference using Cubase with the Ryzen 1700. Zero latency, zero lag/stutter, no issues with 24-32 tracks all loaded with plugins, 8-10 fx channels with plugins, time based phase align on drum channels etc etc... I haven't needed to bounce down/freeze FX heavy tracks or anything like that. Every thing loaded, everything super sampled including a pre-master channel. So.... for $300 I think you will have a hard time beating this, at least until the Threadripper comes out.I didn't see a need to get the 1700x or 1800x but if you want a built in stable overclock then go for it. I'm running the 1700 stock with an Corsair h115i instead of the Wraith Spire. Idle temps are 28-30c.... it stays frosty on water cooled. Before I got the AM4 adapter I used the Wraith for a few days and idle temps were 15-20c higher, seriously. It seems to want to idle around 45-48c with the stock cooler. I don't think it really matters much but if you do want to overclock I would suggest getting a water cooler, you can find Corsair refurbs cheap if you look around.For gaming, I haven't got a chance to play anything super intense. I was playing Pillars of Eternity maxed and it was fine locked at 60fps with rx580 but that game is not resource intensive graphically. It didn't seem to really do anything at all to the CPU either, it was perfectly fine. I'd imagine that this can handle pretty much any game, especially as they continue to update etc. I played new Doom in dx12 and it was like 200fps or something lol. If you are playing above 1080p I would imagine the Ryzen processors are awesome but I can't say.TLDR: No other $300 cpu is going to come close to this one, period. If you are doing CPU intensive things like a DAW or video editing system this is way better than the  i7 7700k imo and it is $50 cheaper. For $500 or so you can completely upgrade.r71700 w/ MSI tomahawk Arctic and Corsair 16g 3200.

AMD Ryzen truly rocks! Great bang for the buck!

  looking for high performance cpu without having to sell a kidney. Read up the reviews on this new Ryzen. Very pleased to find out reviews were spot on as this cpu does perform on the levels quoted. I was running a Linux machine XFCE 17.04 kernel 4.9.0.38, and some software updates on the kernel were required for the system to use the new processor. Once that was done this really rips running programs. Asus x370-A motherboard seems to work well in tandem too.

So why is it that reviewers are still spewing reviews about 1080p gaming I have to monitors one is a 3440 x1440 and a 4k and my Ryzen 7 1700 with a gtx 1080ti does so well thats its almost laughable how they keep bringing up 1080p gaming the future is this chip Direct X 12 and Vulcan are right around the corner.. So what I am saying is that this chip is unreal stupid good.. If you are investing in the FUTURE and not right now than this is the chip for you hands down... You will not go wrong buying this CPU. I am absolutely grateful AMD brought these kind of CPU's to a price that the average guy can get. The only reason Intel is better right now is because they had a lock on the CPU market for over 10 years and those 10 years has been strangling the process of gaming as a whole and future innovations for years.. I am no means a fan boy just a guy that has been in the PC game for years pretty much fed up with the way it was heading.. I am happy extremely satisfied and you will be too with the right mindset going in..

  Price: Competitive.Features: Wraith Spire is a great cooler, can overclock the chip very nicely without much issue.Performance: Unfortunately, while great to have multiple cores, this is still closer to a workstation chip than a gaming chip. It will run games well, but don't expect good performance unless you overclock it.

New Price to Performance King
","

  AMD has really outdone themselves with this new platform. The Ryzen 7 1700 is an amazingly powerful processor in its price bracket, and performs excellently in multi-threaded applications. When you compare this CPU to its closest competitor in terms of performance (i7 6900k), you get about 90% of the performance for 30% of the cost (can vary depending on how far you overclock). Also, the included Wraith Spire cooler is very good considering it comes bundled with the CPU, and has allowed me to achieve a modest overclock while keeping temperatures within reason.Coming from an FX 8350, the difference in power is astounding. A lot of games that I play used to stutter and drop frames on my old computer due to the lack of single threaded performance, but all of that has now changed. I’ve played many of these games on my new build featuring the 1700 and everything is now much more smooth and enjoyable. A lot of people harp on the Ryzen 7 series processors for not matching the ingame performance of Intel’s i7 lineup, but unless you have a very high end GPU and a super high refresh rate 1080p monitor (a situation where you need to have very high framerates constantly) you won’t be affected by this. I personally have a GTX 970 and a 1440p monitor and have had an amazing experience after the upgrade, even with the RAM at stock speeds. So just keep in mind that when you hear people say “Ryzen is bad for gaming,” that truly isn’t the case.With any new launch, there are always going to be some issues in the beginning; as many have pointed out, this platform has some issues with not easily being able to run high speed RAM. I am personally waiting for an updated stable BIOS release from my motherboard manufacturer before I attempt to run my RAM faster than stock speeds, but as far as out of the box performance goes I couldn't be happier. Keep in mind that this issue will more than likely be ironed out within a month or two.Overall, AMD really has hit it out of the park with this new release, and I heavily recommend this CPU for anyone who uses demanding applications, or even people who just play games and occasionally use applications that benefit from having 8 physical cores on the side (such as video editing, rendering, 3D modeling, etc.). If you are going to strictly be gaming and nothing else, maybe this isn’t the right product for you; however, in most other use cases this CPU is the price to performance king, and therefore I highly recommend picking one up.

  I've been wanting to build a high end PC with AMD for many years.  The lackluster performance of the prior generation CPU and aging platform prevented me from doing so. The first PC I built had an Athlon 64 3500+, which I have many fond memories.I've built two rigs with the 1700.  They have performed beyond my expectations.  With a mild overclock, both systems are running at 3.9ghz and are perfectly stable.  I'm sure I could get a little more out of it, but keeping it at 3.9Ghz, on air, seems to be the sweet spot in terms of temperature and stability.  At stock, Cinebench scored around 1400.  Overclocked, I'm getting just under 1700.  Needless to say, there is a lot of multitasking/multi-threading performance on tap.In one of my stability test, I ran Witcher 3 and Cinebench at the same time and still scored above 1400 and without any noticeable impact in gaming.  Running RealBench stress test and web browsing/YouTube, not a problem.  With my i7 4770k, running a stress test of all cores would bog down the system.My primary use for the PC will be gaming and while many reviews have said the i7 7700K is the better buy, I think the 1700 is more future proof.  I don't think we have seen the full potential of the Ryzen 7 series.  As software gets optimized, especially in future titles, I expect Ryzen to perform even better.  I'm gaming at 4k and Ryzen performance has been for this.Since this is a cutting edge platform, there are issues with RAM compatibility, etc.  I haven't been able to get the ram on one of my builds past 2133 and the other is at 2933, below its 3200 rating.  I will outline the RAM used below.Build 1Asus Prime X370-ProCorsair Vengeance LPX 2x8GB 3200 @ 2933 (CMK16GX4M2B3200C16W)Build 2Asus Prime X370-ProCorsair Dominator Platinum 2x8GB 3000 @ 2133 (CMD16GX4M2B3000C15)Hopefully with future UEFI updates, memory compatibility and performance will improve.I'm planning to buy another 1700 to use at work.

I recommend updating the UEFI as early as possible
","

  I was finally able to get an x370 motherboard, the MSI carbon to be precise.  After waiting 5 years since buying my 3770k for actual innovation to occur, not at an increased price, I decided to buy this product.The htop in the pictures shows the reason why you would want to buy this processor.  Compiling, video encoding, and multitasking are all tremendous with this product.  I am currently at stock clocks with a 2400 MHZ 4x8GB RAM configuration, but once a bracket for mounting my EK block arrives, I will be pushing it up to 4 GHZ.Update: Things really improved with a few UEFI updates.  Everything is rock solid, and my compiles are >2x the speed of my 3770k.  Plus native M.2, a better chipset, potential to upgrade later.  No regrets and will probably purchase an AMD 16 core next gen.There are some growing pains with x370 at the moment.  I had a hard time getting it to boot even with linux 4.10.6.  But a days worth of tinkering yielded me > double the performance of the 3770k, so I don't mind these inconveniences.  I recommend updating the UEFI as early as possible, as stability and RAM compatibility is improving by the day.I am so happy AMD was able to do this, and hope that many people are buying this or analogous products to support AMD.  Intel will most likely answer over the next year with something bigger, but right now this is the best CPU / $ available in the world.

  Lots of power for a steal of a deal; 8 cores and 16 threads is way too much for what I need, but it's nice to know I have more horsepower then I need.

The included heatsink and cpu were much easier to install then I thought and the heatsink does the job for stock clock speeds.

A Much Needed Great buy!
","

  Huge upgrade! I've gone from a quad core AMD Phenom II to a Intel i3 and now on to Ryzen. So much more headroom to handle more tasks and run more things at the same time. At the time, my i3's motherboard was having issue's and figured I needed to upgrade. I couldn't wait for results of Threadripper or the i9 platform. The 1700 should suit me for now. The reason I choose this one over the two higher Ryzen 7 tiers is that the 1700 is at a default 65w TDP. To think that we get 8 cores for that amount of power is crazy. My old AMD Llano APU  was rated at 65w and I turned it into a office computer. The other reason I got this one is that I can always overclock it to match closer to the 1700X or 1800X. In games I have noticed a better FPS count over my previous set up and I couldn't be happier. For years I always wanted a high core count cpu for a reasonable price so I can do Workstation stuff and have the speed to game. I do like the RGB cooler that came with it, it is definitely a better build quality then what AMD use to ship with it's processors. I think I would have been fine with the Ryzen 5 1600, but I am happy I choose the 1700. I recommend If you are new to overclocking or not confident on doing it, get the 1700X and buy a higher performance 3rd party cpu cooler so the XFR feature can give you a bit more speed. Only con is that I wanted something like this years ago, and I'm not talking about the FX series or buying a Xeon.I wish I could go back in time and laugh at myself using a 1 core cpu computer lol

I am glad I waited
","

  Incredible value for way less than half the price. I wanted to build a computer for the work I do. Started shopping parts a couple months ago and read about AMD's soon to be released chips. Decided to wait as my work requires 3-27"" monitors ( a 50"" 4K and a 3-27"" monitors was my goal to increase work efficiency ). I always have multiple cloud based subscription services being monitored, a couple email accounts, at least an excel spreadsheet going usually 2, a news feed, a couple dozen chrome tabs open, multiple google maps open, and every day numerous memory overload warnings, an occasional lockup......I was shopping an i7-6900k paired with a couple 1080's.I am glad I waited, even though I feared being an early adopter, this ""built by me and my son computer"" (1700 non X, with a pair of 480's,  corsair 3200 LPX, Asus X370......)  flat out blows my expectations away. For what I was going to spend on the 6900 alone, I bought the 1700, the 2 480's (nuegg MSI RX480 4gb $145ea after rebate) , the SSD a Hundy, the RAM a buck twenty and MOBO. The case, psu, W10, and hard drive were less than half the cost of one 1080.Needless to say, the final cost to build was less than half to build a 6900 system, far less than half.The expected performance for my needs has been far exceeded. I do game but I didn't build this for gaming, but it does game incredibly. The 13yo has confirmed completely.This was my first ever computer build, I did not know how to flash the mobo with the latest, I watched a YouTube video and 10 minutes later - the mobo was flashed with the latest! I did not know how to overclock, I watched a YouTube video and 10 minutes later I was overclocking at 3.8 and 2966 on the ram.My son, I encouraged him to help with the build, bios update, overclocking and software loading. Full disclosure- he pretty much entirely built the computer, flashed the bios,loaded the software ...... I just made sure he watched the videos and followed the directions on the videos. This has been great to build it with him as he has even less computer hardware and software experience than me. He now has real experience and confidence.What he built far exceeds my expectations going in, we have learned just how easy it is to  choose and assemble a computer (2 hours of a 13yo's short attention span and constant refocusing) load an operating system, flash bios, overclock this CPU and ram.What a rewarding thing to do with him (second guess most steps really).The results of the performance of this system, had I bought a twin from ... HP or Dell, I would still be raving about!This computer build has completely blown away my expectations on not just how easy it was to build and tune, but also how it exceeds the performance level I was budgeting to spend over twice as much to achieve. Now we have a bunch of ""fun money"" that was budgeted for work... Our win, a trip to the beach becons this summer now.I'll update with some pics, of the beach of course.

  Great processor at a great price.Running at 3.9 ghz with 1.350v on cpu voltage and tomahawk B350 motherboard and MSI Core Frozr L air cooler.  Ram is currently running at 2933mhz (make sure to set dram voltage to 1.3500v manually in bios as you will have stability issues if you don't).  With this setup I'm staying under 75C even while stress testing in prime 95.  Also, make sure you do a clean OS install and update bios with the latest from manufacturer.  My memory is 16gb Corsair Vengence LPX 3200 mhz and works very well.  Only thing left to do is to hit the magical 3200mhz limit on my RAM.  Overall, I'd strongly suggest this build as it can do everything the more expensive 8 core cpu's from Intel can do at a much lower cost.  Personally, unless you need dual SLI I'd also recommend saving the 60-100 dollars on the X370 boards and stay with the B350 boards as they seem to overclock just as well.

Truly God-Tier Mid-Range CPU
","

  My experience with this chip has been glorious. I upgraded to this from an i5 4440S, and the boost in game performance has been surprising - I didn't realize how much of a bottleneck my CPU was. It's been fun maxing out sliders in games that previously gave me choppy performance at max settings. For instance, I set the draw distance to maximum in Dying Light and the framerate is rock-solid. Bodies also don't disappear as much, staying behind and littering the streets. I'm rocking a GTX 970 and gaming on a 2560x1080 monitor, BTW.The most CPU usage I've seen in a game so far has been a tie between Doom and Dying Light, which often stay around 25% usage but have momentary spikes to around 58% when things get particularly hectic. It's almost disappointing not having any games that max out the 1700, but when we do start seeing games optimized for 16 threads, this thing's gonna keep pace. It definitely doesn't feel like the kinda CPU I'll wanna replace in the next four years.Unfortunately, I'm one of the few people unable to overclock this thing to 4GHz. Thermals aren't a problem with my Corsair H60 AIO, but I've upped the voltage all the way to 1.4125V without getting a stable 4GHz OC. Oh well, 3.9GHz at 1.32V is nice and stable, and it generally runs at 32C idle, 45C while gaming, and 72C while stress testing at full load. Very impressive stuff. Cinebench score was 1709, way the heck better than Intel's older 12C/24T Xeon X5650 chip(score of 1279) and even a bit higher than a non-overclocked 1800X(usually scores around 1620).If you're using an older quad-core CPU, I'd say this is a worthwhile upgrade. Just be wary that you'll need to use DDR4 RAM, which is expensive right now because cryptocurrency miners are eating into supply lines and ruining it for the gamers.

Using the RyZEN Master program downloaded from AMD.com, I overclocked the CPU to 3.8GHz without any issues at ,my first try.

  I am not the type to do all kinds of benchmarks or overclocking with my CPU, but I have had this up and running ever since I finally got my motherboard on March 14th and so far it is fantastic. I upgraded from an i7 3770, and carried over my gtx 980 reference card until I can get my hands on either vega or a 1080ti depending on which is a superior value/performance combo.So far, combined with the 980 I have seen over 100% improvement in fps on nearly all my games running ultra settings, v-sync, and on my ultrawide 1440p monitor compared with the older i7. I was unable to get forza horizon 3 to play at anything above 22fps before but now I'm anywhere from 45-50fps. CPU has yet to show more than 25% load or exceed 40C on anything I've done, including the witcher 3, forza, gears of war 4, civilization 6, and more. I'd say that for gaming it is more than sufficient to handle just about anything based on what I've experienced so far, and for multitasking it could not be better. I'm sure as more time goes on things will be optimized even further and it'll just get better. I'm very happy with this processor!

which is fantastic! So
","

  I upgraded to this from one of the original Intel Sandy Bridge CPUs (2500k, from the year 2011). The single-threaded performance is (unsurprisignly) similar to that of the six year old 2500k.This CPU shines, though, in a heavily mutli-threaded or highly-concurrent environment. With this CPU, it's no big deal to run three virtual machines, a Twitch stream, two copies of Eve online, and have Visual Studio up. All of this happens without noticeable slowdown, which is fantastic!So, my conclusion won't surprise anyone who's looked at the benchmarks: This is a great CPU for multi-tasking. Not the best for heavy single-threaded tasks, but a great CPU if you take concurrency into account!

  Overclocked to 3.9GHz @ 1.33750v on a very budget ASRock AB350M Pro4 motherboard. Could have gotten 4GHz with ease but this board has a bit of an issue with voltage drops upon load and has no LLC options, so I would have had to feed it far too many volts to achieve 4GHz (found 1.5v to be stable since droops of 1.42v aren't uncommon). Not worth potentially lowering the lifespan of the chip due to heat/voltage for such a small performance gain. Overall I'm impressed, and AMD has finally brought me back for the first time since the days of the Athlon X4 860k Black Edition! Can't wait to see what Ryzen v2 and v3 hold in the future, and hope that AMD sticks to their word that they will be keeping with the AM4 socket the entire way!

  This was an incredible deal at $239, but at any price you will 100% get your money’s worth. Paired with an asus x370-F and asus ai suite, overclocked to 3.8 w/ease and cooler than my old intel i5 by a mile. Considering the lesser power draw and heat, it practically should pay for itself after a few years. Never thought I’d say this, but I am so glad I made the switch to AMD. TBH, Intel pretty much made the decision for me with their bs motherboard games, and AMD is keeping this socket at least through 2020. Don’t hesitate to make the change yourself; I am so glad I did. This also came with the best stock cooler I have ever seen!

  I paired this with a GIGABYTE GA-AB350M-D3H motherboard. FYI, ESXI is not quite ready for this pairing yet. Ryzen itself has a lot of problems and is not officially supported. People have gotten it to work, but it really depends on your motherboard. I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 at this point, and have manually upgraded my kernel (not something for the faint of heart when it comes to tech) to an unofficial build of 4.11.2 and I have a KVM/Kimchi setup working beautifully with G.Skill  F4-2400C15Q-64GFX memory (64GB, 4x16GB sticks). I had to memtest them in pairs till I figured out which ones belonged in which slots without throwing errors.Overall I LOVE this box, but it's definitely not for the consumer who doesn't want to get a whole bunch of elbow grease on them. Lots of learning and I know some firmware/bios updates will make this better with time.

  Upgraded from a FX8320. Modest overclock to 3.5ghz with the stock Wraith cooler with no problem. Got the 72* C after an hour on Prime95.  I would highly recommend this over a 1700x or 1800x; neither of which come with a  cooler and are more expensive.Make sure to check you motherboard manufacturer for the type of ram needed. My DDR 4 3200mhz will only go to 2666mhz, while the same brand and series clocked at 3000mhz will run at 2997mhz. I'm hoping the next bios update corrects this.I use my PC to play games and create videos using Camtasia, Adobe products, and Vegas. If you're only playing games, an Intel 7700k might be a better choice. If you want a processor that will run games at 90 fps instead of 100-110, but will render a video in half the time, you can get the Ryzen 1700 for 329 or an Intel 6900k for 1000. Really wasn't a difficult choice.

  Amazing CPU albeit there are still some growing pains with motherboard manufacturers and ram compatability.  I purchased a Gigabyte B350 Gaming motherboard and Corsair ram from Gigabytes HCL and could not get my system to post initially.  I tried all slots with a single stick and ended up trying a different ram kit which worked perfectly upon install.Performance is amazing so far and game vendors are beginning to optimize for Ryzen (see updated benchmarks for Ashes of Singularity on PC perspective for example).  Once firmware updates are released for motherboards supporting faster ram and improving compatability, things will only get better, but very impressed with performance so far, single threaded apps run great and multithreaded are even faster.  I'm out envying my friends i7 7700k system in nearly everything.The spire heatsink is even impressive keeping my CPU load temps under 42c.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase, welcome back AMD!

  The stock fan is surprisingly good. The fan is incredibly silent even on max speeds and keeps the CPU very cold. According to Ryzen Master my temperature sits around 43 C on idle and climbs to 55 under load (mind you its overclocked to 3.4 GHZ). I had difficulties with Windows freezing up initially but after updating to Windows 10's current update all the problems went away.Its quite a fast thing too. I do a lot of work in 3d modeling software and can comfortably work on complex models while firefox is open with 20+ tabs on my other monitor.

Also, I noticed a significant boost in performance when I downloaded the Ryzen power management settings for Windows 10.

  I first thought the product/s were defective but after receiving the replacements i noticed I may have had the ram in the wrong slots. Usually they go in dims one and 3 but this motherboard specify's they go in dims 2 and 4 if you are only using 2 ram sticks. Had a pc shop even look at the build and they didn't even catch the ram slip up. Cost me $20 for their opinion which came down to guess of a bad motherboard or/and cpu going by what the motherboard error lights were showing.

  Bang for the buck these new Ryzen CPU's are the way to go unless you have some very specific games that happen to be better supported by intel. I mainly use my machine for video work and not gaming, this blows my old intel setup out of the water for half the price.

   I am an Old AMD fan, i started out with the Athlon XP, FX 55, then to the FX 60, The phenom II 955, 1010t, then the FX 8350, 8320, 8370, and now got my hands on a Ryzen 1700, to me its not strange for AMD to breakthrough and bring a great product to the table, disrupt the market and give good much needed competition, i was torn between this or a Intel 7700K, while the I7 is in fact a speed demon, i needed more of a CPU for my build, a strong workstation and a capable gaming machine, since i upgraded my display to 1440p i don't see any difference in any of the gaming benchmarks with my GTX 1080, frames are always above 60 at all times all games ultra settings, i cant tell a difference between this rig and my other 6700k in games coupled with the same GFX Card, but the Ryzen build shines on CC projects and Sony Vegas very clearly, i paired this with a Gigabyte AX370 K7 and 16GB LPX Vengeance C16 Ram and my GTX 1080, it took me a while setting up the BIOS and updating the revision to F3, Ram automatically set to XMP and got the correct timings at 3200mhz, CPU set to 4GH stable at 1.452V, am running CPU and GFX Card in a big water loop so my temps are always low and under control at all times, while am very happy with the performance, a incredible jump over the FX8350 OC to 4GHZ as well, but i was supersized at the overclocking headroom, 4GHZ seems to be the limit of these chips, nothing more even with voltage increases seems to work, the result is over 60% performance peak gains in overall experience, well done AMD, will definitely upgrade my other builds with more Ryzen CPUs very soon.

  Its just amazing, upgraded from an i5-3330 3.0ghz. Love having the option of overclocking with a stock cooler. Don't know if I want to overclock yet, just using the boost at the moments and its chugging. Games are always smooth, no dips in FPS, no freezes. Stream at 2500kb/s at medium x264 preset and see little performance dips, able to stream any game that my i5 could not handle on super-fast preset. Some of these games that I used to not be able to stream are BF1, Overwatch, Minecraft (I don't know how), and CS:GO.

Ryzen 1700 segmentation fault issue parts still selling at retail.
","

  My Ryzen 1700 was defective with the 'Ryzen segmentation fault' issue fabricated into the CPU. AMD is calling the issue ""Performance Marginality"" which I think is a fancy way of saying when you need the performance - it might crash instead.Replacement parts from AMD appear to have fixed this issue, with the caveat that they must be manufactured in/after week 30 (as noted on the CPU date code on its surface) according to blogs (search Phoronix).The problem is the older parts are still in the pipeline. Amazon's stock as of late August was week 18, and my local big electronics store parts were fabricated week 15.AMD has yet to release an errata or any formal guidance, so as much as they hope the issue is limited in scope it might be wise to hold off your purchase.I'm looking to purchase a replacement when Amazon starts shipping product from after week 30 (see the attached picture for date code location). Consider posting your date code as a response.

Build for the future AND enjoy gaming now
","

  I overclocked this chip using AI Suite III by Asus. I dropped it on the ROG Crosshair VI Hero motherboard, added 16Gb of Trident Z DDR4 3200 and an MSI GTX 1080 with 8Gb of GDDR5 (factory overclocked). For gaming TODAY, Intel's most expensive offerings will get you a few more FPS, but on software that supports multi-threaded/multicore CPUs, this thing matches or pulls away from just about every processor out there for only $300. As more games move to this technology, this chip will only improve while the i7's will quickly become obsolete. Build for the future AND enjoy gaming now. Buy the 1700 (not the 1700X or 1800X), overclock it, and thank me later. Also, if you are doing content creation or VERY heavy multitasking this is also your stop. Don't believe me? Awesome! Keep reading the reviews below mine or go watch any of the 100s of Youtube videos until you do. AMD really nailed this one.

AMD Ryzen: slayer of the Kaby Lake
","

  Where to start? I embarked on this PC upgrading journey with two definitive things in mind: A) I knew that I wanted to go with an enthusiast build. That's where AMD came into play. Then there's B) the final indicator was my curiosity -- nay, elation -- thriving from AMD putting out what seemed to be a truly competitive chipset. After following Ryzen 7 (and the newer 5 series) I decided to be a part of this AMD comeback generation. I paired my Ryzen with the AM4 Asus x370 pro Motherboard, 32GB Corsair ddr4-3000 memory, and a beautiful EVGA Geforce GTX 1080. This machine screams!The workstation capabilities of the 7 series processors is unbeatable! Your setup will be out-performing even top-end Intel chips in multi-threading with little-to-no sweat.DO NOT invest into Ryzen if you're hung up on single-core processing. This chipset can be overclocked within a range of 3.8ghz - 4.25ghz. If you're comfortable with the OC environment, then the 1700 is the right CPU for anything you throw at it. The 1700x or 1800x allot for that extra ~300mhz of speed. But when is 300mhz ever been worth $200+?Caveat: Be careful in pairing the Ryzen series CPUs with MoBo and RAM options. You'll want to stick with one of the newer Asus models: Crosshair or x370 pro. These are built for Ryzen and marry the idiosyncrasies of the chipset well.Having both confirmed Motherboard support and a verified RAM package is a MUST. Ryzen benefits from greater volume of memory, as well as quicker memory. Try for something above the 2133 standard for best results.P.S. ditch the stock fan if it's in your budget. I slapped a Cooler Master 212 Evo on my Ryzen 7 1700 and it was 100% worth the extra investment.

Rock solid, quiet... and about 50% faster in 3D apps (as expected) compared to a 6 core i7-3930kSo jut waiting for a bios update to set the ram at 2400 vs 2133.

  Great specs, unusable processor as it randomly locks when pushing it.  Ryzen CPUs manufactured prior to the 25th week of 2017 have a hardware defect is related to heavy concurrent workloads.

  I think this is a #1 seller because it is a relatively low cost low power consumption entry point for the next generation of CPUs, One huge surprise is the HUGE lighted cooling fan which comes with it. It seems to run very cool, but then it takes a lot of computing to keep this chip busy.Notice: This Chip does NOT support Windows 7.If you are more practically minded, a processor more like an FX-8230E will be as powerful as you can use at 1/3 the cost.

Decent, but don't buy for non windows use.

  The CPU is awesome.  The fan included is a makes the chip run in the low 50C range, and I'd prefer something a little better. It is stable though.  The LEDs don't really work well, but that's more Asus's fault for having a terrible motherboard design (prime x370 pro is the worst)  I deducted a star because AMD was not ready to ship the chipset for these processors at launch and it has caused me a lot of headaches and wasted time getting a stable PC. Every game I play on it flies.Further, if you like open source operating systems, you may want to wait a bit before going with a Ryzen build as there is issues with support.  AMD hasn't released all the specs for temperature sensors yet and they have a lot of quirks with the chipset and UEFI to work out.3 months later:I've revised my rating down to 3 stars because of additional compatibility issues.  VirtualBox is unstable with 32bit operating systems on this chip (including windows xp). There are at least 4 serious issues on FreeBSD. On Linux, programs such as bash randomly crash.  Under high CPU load with SMT enabled, certain instructions cause the system to hang or reboot!  See Phoronix coverage of this issue as well as the various bug reports in FreeBSD and Linux distros, and git commits to DragonFly BSD to try to work around it.  AGESA 1.0.0.6a does not fix this, but it did help with some of the issues under windows, RAM compatibility and general stability while gaming for me.At this point, my RAM is working at full speed (2667), I've been able to overclock to 3.75Ghz using water cooling, and overwatch runs great. Without the overclock, CPU usage is around 20% during Overwatch on my system. With the overclock, it's around 12%.

Save your money! Buy this and not the 1700x or 1800x.

  This processor blew my expectations out of the water.Let me start with the setup. I have 16gb of ddr4 ram at 2400mhz, an asus prime b350 mobo, ati r9 390 and the r7 1700 with stock spire cooler.I launched the PC and it had an inital auto overclock of 300mhz making it 3.3ghz across all cores. I was able to get a stable overclock of 3.8ghz at 1.34v and 38x multiplier.Cpu runs at approximately 75 c at full load on my overclock. I stressed it for 6 hours at 3.8ghz. The cpu is also capable of down clocking itself when overclocked. I have seen the cpu down clock itself all the way to 900 mhz while doing nothing. This cpu will not only save you money but is an excellent bang for the buck at 8c/16 threads.I have been able to play arma 3 exile online with over 30 people at 55fps constant.Battlefield 1 plays at an average of 110 fpsTitanfall 2 gets glitchy occasionally but averages atound 130fps averageIf you have any questions feel free to ask.UPDATEI have determined that 3.8ghz overclock is too much for the stock cooler being that it is requiring such a massive voltage increase! I have found that the sweet spot seems to be at about 37x multiplier (3700mhz) and 1.2 volts to the CPU. I have now left it at that level and have included benchmarks from Real Bench, CPUZ and Cinebench. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask!All overclocking was done on stock cooler.

  Stunning.This review is coming from someone who was a long time AMD CPU supporter...all the way back to the Athlon XP days and before...who had given up on AMD CPUs when the FX 'Bulldozer' processors were ultimately a huge let down.  At that time I was running an unlocked and overclocked Phenom 2 X6 at 4.0 GHz...this was a remarkable speed for a 6 core CPU back around 2010-2011.  I switched to an i5 3570k and was amazed at the performance boost achieved especially in gaming.  I then went to 3770k, 4770k and 4790k, which is where my Intel CPU purchases halted because they were just stringing everyone along with MINISCULE performance upgrades with each following generation.  I had two nearly identical systems, one with 4770k and the other 4790k, 16GB 2133MHz DDR3, plenty of SSDs and nice GPUs.  I wanted to make the switch to Ryzen, but needed justification for purchasing a new CPU, motherboard and DDR4 RAM.  I did a quick check of eBay, and to my surprise found that Haswell 4770/4790 CPUs were fetching just about what I paid for them brand new 3+ years prior!  I ended up selling my 4790k CPU/Z97 board/16GB RAM for $425, which was more than enough to justify making my upgrade.Why did I just bore you with that story?  To show that I am not a 'fan boy' and purchase what equates to the best bang for your buck.  Anyhow...onto the review..AMD as the underdog has shaken things up once again.  A round of applause is in need for violently pushing the PC/CPU world forward in such a short time frame.  Rewind 6 months and anything over 8 logical threads would nearly cost you an arm and a leg...but now I purchased an 8 core, 16 thread, monster, with a motherboard, for $330 + tax.  Granted this was from a brick and mortar store that has fantastic board/CPU combo deals...it is still unbelievable to get a CPU/motherboard from Amazon for less than $400.I have attached a photo/graph from CNET that does a nice job of summing up performance comparing 1700X to 7700k.  While I know this is obviously not the 1700X, it is too simple to overclock this 1700 to 1700X performance levels and beyond.I've been at PC building for a long time, 15+ years, and I can't ever remember a time where I was even remotely close to satisfied with the OEM included heatsink & fan.  Leave it up to AMD to blow that perception out of the water.  Not only am I satisfied with the Wraith Spire heatsink, I am downright impressed.  It is absolutely silent and it looks sweet in the process with the backlit AMD logo and RGB LED ring around it..assuming your motherboard has the header/connector for it; ASrock AB350M Pro 4 does have the connector for it.  Looking good and working well under stock conditions is one thing, however, being able to handle a minor overvolt and overclock is really what blew me away.  Granted adding approximately 0.1V, or 8%, isn't ridiculous..it is still commendable.I have my 1700 CPU humming along at 3.7GHz on all 8 cores/16 threads with the stock cooler and it is still completely silent; CPU voltage set in Ryzen Master at 1.1875V.  I have the CPU fan forced to FULL SPEED in the ASRock BIOS which equates to 2700 RPMs, and still SILENT.  Now, you won't likely be able to leave a stress test running all cores/threads overclocked for hours & hours on end, BUT for normal usage it certainly appears to be more than fine so far.  I have stress tested alll cores/threads with x264 encoding in a loop for ~20 minutes and have found the CPU to plateau at 78C-80C after ~5 minutes where it would just stay (photos attached).  This is WELL within operating specs for the CPU.  I will also add that presently there is absolutely ZERO additional air flow in my case for the CPU as I was coming from an AIO watercooler; which I did not have the mounting bracket for AM4.  With some additional fans, this temperature would undoubtedly be better and posssibly allow to push further.  Now, as always, your mileage may vary, but from what I've seen this is fairly common for the 1700 to hit 3.6-3.7GHz range on all cores/threads with minimal additional voltage.  The best thing about my 8 thread/16 core CPU running at 3.7GHz with the factory cooler you might wonder?  The CPU is $300 and motherboard retails for $80.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it Intel!Speaking of overclocking the CPU, it is very nice that AMD took the time to develop the Ryzen Master utility.  It is so unbelievably convenient to have software that WORKS, key word here, in Windows, to test the stability of the CPU if you're going to be altering clock speeds and voltages.  Not only can you alter CPU settings from Ryzen Master, but RAM settings and the most important voltage settings overall to alter to dial in your Ryzen CPU, as well as disable CPU cores if you're looking to do some crazy/enthusiast overclocking.AMD has provided a top notch product with support behind it.  The support is evident actually in relation to the one complaint about Ryzen/AM4 at this point; RAM speed compatibility. The good thing is that AMD and the motherboard manufacturers are not sitting by with idle hands regarding this issue.  They have been rolling out BIOS updates and most recently a very large universal update called an AGESA BIOS update.  This stands for AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture, and quite simply, for RAM speeds, means many more options and a drastic compatibility improvement.  It has other purposes, but this was the most important feature at this time.  Before choosing a motherboard I made sure to see who had released the newest AGESA 1.0.0.6  BIOS update for their boards.  Be sure to do a little homework before blindly purchasing a motherboard & RAM!If you want a plug-and-play experience with overclocked DDR4 RAM, this is generally anything beyond 2133/2400 MHz, do yourself a big favor and check the motherboard QVL for RAM; QVL is qualified vendor list and shows what RAM they have tested and what maximum speed it will run at.  This information can be found on the motherboard manufacturer's website under support for that specific board.  I've seen too many people complaining that they bought highly overclocked memory because a RAM manufacturer has a good reputation, so it should 'just work'...this is not the case with a brand new CPU architecture.  This generally holds true for Intel because even their newest processors are derivatives of older renditions and compatibility is very, very mature.  That being said, if you are willing to spend time tweaking in (what can be) a tedious trial & error process...then you can be rewarded with increased memory speeds via manual overclocking.  Just be prepared to A) educate yourself on how to do so, and B) spend some time getting things to work.  Otherwise you may be limited to lower RAM speeds than what you have purchased if you don't do your homework first!The bottom line here folks is that you are getting a whole lot for your money here.  While Intel still holds a slight advantage in single-threaded workloads, odds are you would never know the difference unless you are running benchmarks to compare them.  The fact of the matter is that AMD has blown the door wide open for the CPU thread 'war'...and software manufacturers are going to get on board the multi-threaded bandwagon to begin leveraging all the cores/threads they have at their disposal.I leave you with one simple question...If someone said do you want 8 cookies or 16 cookies, for the SAME price...which would you choose?  It's a no-brainer.

Requires work! But worth it over the 1700x and 1800x
","

  UPDATE 02/07/2018:  It has been some time now, and I have had a thoroughly great experience with this chip.  The motherboard issues i discussed below have been fixed, RAM now runs at 3200 like it should and BIOS has had steady improvements.  AMD steadily has been pushing out driver and Agesa updates, which probably helped with some of the previous stability issues.  The chip itself for me hits a stability wall at 3.95GHz at 1.425.  I haven't gone higher on the voltage based on AMD's specifications.  The chip will boot and get into Windows at 4GHz but crashes under heavy load.  I keep the chips at 3.9GHz / 1.392VCore, and it is stable through all applications and tests I've done.  Temperatures with the Arctic Freezer 240mm AIO idle around 30C and max peak at 72C with normal fan speed settings.Still highly recommend, but given the drop in prices of the 1700X and 1800X, this chip is not longer the clear choice in the R7 family.  Pick any of the three and you should not be disappointed.----------------------------------I am coming from an Intel i7-4790k in my previous build.  I opted for the 1700 over the higher ""x"" R7 family chips and have not been disappointed with performance.  It will require some work on your part and there will be growing pains depending on the motherboard and ram you choose.  That means taking the time understand your BIOS settings and tweak accordingly, test for stability, tweak some more, test until it crashes, then tweak some, and repeat until it's completely stable.  I have 32GBs G.Skill Trident Z 3200 ram and cannot get them past 2933 with the Gigabyte AX370-Gaming K7 motherboard.  The motherboard itself still has a buggy BIOS that needs improvement.  In time, I'm sure the BIOS will be fixed and both will perform as expected.If you buy this chip over the other R7 chips, you HAVE to overclock it.  It's base clock performance is mediocre and is what you would expect from a chip at 3GHz.  The 3.7GHz boost will hit all cores but is mostly consistent just in the first two cores.  When overclocked however, this things performs better than the 1700x and is on par with the 1800x.  It's power consumption up to 3.7 GHz is pretty low with mine maxing at 1.236v on the VCore on a 3.7GHz OC.  Higher than that requires voltages you would expect to sustain the frequency.The included wraith cooler is nice and you will likely be able to OC up to around 3.7GHz before considering a beefier cooler.  I opted for a liquid cooler and temps are very satisfying.  I've had no issues with the chip so far other than operator error issues.Overall, save yourself some cash and get the 1700.  If you put in the effort to OC your system, it will perform as good as the 1800x.

  Processor went from box, to motherboard, and my PC would not start up. Troubleshooting well over 2 hours, took apart my entire pc and started fresh, nothing. Finally tried my old Ryzen 5 1400 chip, and the pc started as normal. So apparently the Ryzen 7 1700 chip I ordered was dead on arrival. It even looked as if the chip was used before being sent to me, yet the package was sealed. Really disappointed in AMD if this is the case. I bought a NEW item, not a refurbished or defective one.

An absolute steal for the price/performance ratio

  I bought it at Microcenter at release and all I have to say is just overclock it to 4.0GHz and just kick back and drink a cup of coffee. Productivity will skyrocket compared to any 4 core processor. If you game, don't sweat it. This CPU has so much headroom that you'll hardly ever stutter and the FPS lows and highs are really close together so you'll have an extremely smooth gaming experience. I sware, I never stutter with this thing, it's ludicrous. It's a steal at this price, hell, go for a good B350 board if you just want. If you are sure you will only use 1 GPU go ahead but it won't have the features the x370, be mindful. If you are still unsure if it's worth it then it's fine, just wait for windows/linux updates (Run great in linux BTW) and Bios updates since this is a brand new platform. There will be bugs. Overall i'm satisfied with my purchase.

Tremendous value!

  Tremendous value for the price. This is hands down the most bang for your buck. Im still amazed at the value I got for $300.  I've always been an intel fan and knew they was over pricing their cpus, but I had no idea it was to this extent. A $300 cpu that plows through workloads like a $1100 intel cpu, just goes to show how much intel was ripping us off. Thank you AMD for making 8 core processors financially viable to the public at large.Gaming wise, Ryzen chips are only lagging behind intel by 5 to 8 percent, but that will change once game developers begin to optimize ryzen with their games like they've been doing for intel cpus the last 10 years.If you're trying to decide between the 1700, 1700x and the 1800x, get the 1700. It easily overclocks to 3.9 with included cpu cooler giving you an 1800x cpu for $300. 1700, 1700x and 1800x are the same silicon chips, the only difference is the x series has a better chance at overclocking to 4ghz stable.

Onboard video on MB/CPU combo does not work without expensive video card

  I bought this bundled with an ASUS X370-F MB and it seems like a scam to me.  I chose the MB in part because it has onboard video (onboard HDMI and a data port).  But they don't work and are completely useless (as I found out too late) because if you read the fine print, the CPU doesn't support video.  So the bottom line is you're expected to buy a $600 video card if you want your monitor(s) to turn on and the onboard video is completely useless.  This mb/cpu combo will not work without a PCIEX video card. If you're a gamer and are prepared to buy an expensive video card?  It might be fine, I don't know because my monitor won't turn on and if it does, why buy a mb with onboard video?

","

  This CPU is pretty solid, and aside from topping out at around 4.0Ghz is a solid performer.  For someone heavily invested in Intel, and already on an X99 platform it might make more sense to pick up a used i7-5960X than this chip.  The cost of a X370 motherboard, this chip, and completely reinstalling software and hardware versus dropping an i7-5960X in an existing setup.  It would just be easier to get the used i7-5960X, as long as you can find a good deal. Also, another good used chip for X99 users stuck on the platform is the Xeon E5-2683 v3 OEM, if you can find it in the $400 range.  Even with a i7-5820k or i7-6800k, I wouldn't run out and buy this chip (unless there's a need).  The gains would mostly be seen in heavy rendering, and in gaming there would be an unnoticeable (for the most part) hit in performance.  Coming from any other quad core or less, or AMD processor, I'd say go for it.  Yeah, your mainstream quad core i7's and i5's churn out a few more frames a second (under ideal conditions from paid benchmarkers/reviewers), but say you want to run a streaming radio station, windows updates kicks in, or you have some project rendering, you'd rather have the extra 4 cores than not, while gaming, web surfing, or any general use.I'm taking one star off because of the release.  The headaches with the constant BIOS updates and stability issues.  Most have been ironed out, but AMD should've planned that better.

  8 cores 16 threadspower efficientawesome stock cooler - quiet and largevery fast at multithreaded taskshuge improvement at single threaded tasks though doesnt clock as highCons:I don't want to say it doesnt overclock well -- i went from 3ghz to 3.8ghz without hardly any trouble thats a 25% increase -- but coming from a 4.6ghz FX-8320 and compared to intel 7700k it is behind a bit in clock speedsome gaming FPS falls short of haswell IPC goalsOther Thoughts:I really do not like spending $300 for a cpu. The last 5-6 machines i built were amd quad cores -- mostly 860k for $67 clocked to 4ghz. This chip blows them away in everything. No more stuttering in gaming. This ryzen maintains much higher minimum fps, i didnt do apples to apples compare between ryzen 1700 and the 860k but I ran a CS:GO benchmark (all settings on low 720) on a stock clocked FX-8320e and this Ryzen.  The FX8320 scored 154fps average. Ryzen scored 292fps with ddr4 2133. 312fps with ddr4 3000 and 334fps ryzen ddr4 3000 at 3.8ghz. My overwatch FPS went up from 110 average to 175 (epic settings 1080p) I would buy it again, I do believe it will be faster in gaming with OS patching or bios updates. Memory speed seems to make a big impact.

  I can overclock to 3.825GHz at 1.34V with CoolerMaster 212 LED after-market cooler. The temp never goes over 80 degrees even when running stress testing using Prime 95. If you want to overclock, do not use stock cooler. The temp is over 90 with stock cooler under stressing at 3.7GHz.The cpu beats 6700k in every way. I can manage to run Prime 95 with all 16 workers running. With intel, there were always some workers which stopped working. Besides, I can multitask like a king with this processor.

  The Ryzen 7 1700 is a bargain for what you are getting!I needed a new more powerful PC since I work from home, I also do a occasional gaming and when the computer is not being used it mines for crypto currency.My old PC is still fair/good, just wasn't good enough, plus I wanted some more modern features like NVME, USB 3.1 etc . It was an intel i7 2600k rig by the way.I was looking at another intel i7  the 7700k to be exact which was still only 4 cores when I stumbled on the reviews of AMD ryzen, I am not brand loyal at all, as my first desktop that served me well for years was an AMD Athlon XP which at the time was better than Intel Pentium 4, I simply buy what is best at the time.Anyways reviews looked really good and liked that its not the end of the road product like the i7-7700k which I was previously interested in, as the new i7 that will come out next year will require a whole new platform(motherboard). I liked that AMD says ryzen will stay on this platform until 2020 in case I feel a need to upgrade later on(doubt I will but like having the option).So far loving this processor, it gobbles up everything I throw at it. I am using with an arock x370 killer A/C motherboard which I got for super cheap on newegg on sale, good decent board, bios software isn't as nice as asus but works.I was able to get my new DDR-4 3200 mhz ram working right of of the package, and wanted to do a modest overclock without to much heat as using included box cooler(which is actually really nice with RGB). Was able to get 3.85 Ghz across all 8 cores at 1.295v stable with prime95. I could most likely overclock more but want cool running system.I am still impressed by the way this thing multitasks without even skipping a beat.Literally posting this review on it while, have tons of other tabs open in chrome some with videos paused, wife left a bunch tabs open in Microsoft Edge which I just left open, mining on 2 GPU's in the background and converting a bluray movie file into apple compatible format to place this movie on my daughters ipad. Its really impressive.I have 2 month old laptop with the latest and greatest intel  i7 kabylake processor which is intels best and while I do realize its a laptop compared to a desktop PC the difference is like night and day when it comes to multitasking, Some of my large excel VBA calculations from work take literally few seconds to calculate on my laptop which are instant on the ryzen 7. Yes its only a few seconds but when working clicking then waiting over and over again does slow you down.Sorry for the rambling review, didn't plan on it but was just sitting here really impressed with my purchase and thought I would share :-)My conclusion is basically the Ryzen 7 1700 is a great buy for anybody that wants a powerful Desktop CPU.

  Absolutely amazing chip. I did a mild overclock to 3700mhz on the stock cooler and temps are well within a healthy range. I got a cheap AB350 motherboard for $70 bucks. My single core performance beats by old i5 6600k and the multi-core performance is more than double. What this adds up to is incredibly smooth gaming. With the I5 it always felt that there was micro-stutter but this thing is like butter. With my GTX1070 practically every game is firmly over 60fps (All that my monitor can display) with all visual features on or some very minor adjustments like unnecessary shadow detail.Having been jerked around by intels constant socket revisions I look forward to upgrading to Ryzen 2 on the same AM4 socket in a couple of years and Vega 64 in a couple of weeks.

AMD has risen with RYZEN.  8 cores and 16 threads on par with a 6900K with no drawbacks.  Scratch that ""upgrade itch""!
","

  A friend of mine and I that run Beamng.drive, where I create content like maps, and he creates car crash videos.  For both him and I, this processor series (RYZEN) is definitely a win-win situation over the intel, due to more cores for price.  More cores means faster video compilation for him, and faster AI pathing tests here at higher FPS (smoother video when more cars simulated) when testing out my 'maps'.To quote a post I put on their forum for the game/sim:""For what it's worth, one of the car-crash guys bench-marked (on bananabench) a Ryzen 8-core 1700X to an intel 6900k cpuThe intel had 2400mhz quad channel ddr4, and the Ryzen had dual-channel 2133/2400mhz ddr4, the benchmark was within 0.5%, meaning, one-half of ONE percent, in other words, margin of error aside, all things were equal.On applying the AGESA microcode (bios) update, and being able to run the RAM at 2933mhz dual channel, the mbeams/s figure on banana-bench for the Ryzen jumped a WHOPPING TEN PERCENT higher than the intel (and it's old score).Keep in mind this is 2933mhz dual channel, vs 2133/2400mhz quad channel... but the RYZEN WON with faster dual channel memory. Better branch prediction, scheduler, better tech, etc.Woohoo, go AMD, Threadripper is promising to be everything Ryzen is and *MOAR* (more). I'll wait, I got some bills in my pocket with AMD's initials on them, just waiting, patiently.The cpu market hasn't been this interesting since Phenom II / Pentium 4 & dual core / Core 2 Duo / 1st-gen i7 cpus.""So basically, the 1700 is pretty much the same as the 1700X if you overclock it (set the GHZ speeds it runs at yourself), if you don't want to get involved in 'overclocking' for fear of getting in over your head (nothing wrong with that, some of us can't be bothered), or don't want to mess about and possibly have an unstable computer  (again if you aren't 100% sure don't do it), or break something (it can happen, usually doesn't though), step up to the 1700X or 1800X.  Diminishing returns occur past this chip in the series though, unless you have a super-heavy workload.IN SITUATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING, WITH FAST DDR4 DUAL CHANNEL RAM THIS CHEAP BEATS THE 6900K WITH QUAD-CHANNEL RAM.  Large letters here to get point across.  IT BEAT THE INTEL BY ABOUT 10% CLOCK FOR CLOCK.  So, even if this clocks 10% less than the intel in the end, you'll end up nose to nose with a 6900K processor, that would typically retail around 1000$ (could be more or less due to market fluctuation or demand etc).These CPUs are good for the following:*New games that use 4 or more 'threads' as this gives you plenty, 8 real cores with 16 threads similar to intel's hyperthreading, for ultra smooth responsiveness handling even a full workload.  No comparison to a quad-core i5 running a quad-core game, this blows i5 and many i7's out of the water with it's processing abilities.*Video encoding tasks as such many youtubers and twitch streamers running the latest software and games will LOVE this.*Simulations that take advantage of newer multi-threaded CPUs, such as Cities Skylines city simulator or Beamng.drive soft-body physics sim.*Gaming while streaming, this handles content creation great as stated previously WHILE gaming.*Not wanting to be limited by PCI-Express lanes on the dated x99 platform or newer x299 platform, and not have to pay 1000$ for a cpu with 40+ PCI-Express lanes.That having been said, previously posted reviews from March to June of this year may not take into account the recent improvements on AGESA microcode BIOS UPDATES.  These updates now enable FAST DDR4 MEMORY capability on most sets of recent RAM sticks with most AMD RYZEN AM4 motherboards.  Definitely check out reviews by popular review sites like Guru3d and Anandtech or Tomshardware to have an idea of what RAM works with what MOTHERBOARD.  It's definitely good knowing what you're buying will work or not!  RAM that doesn't work at it's max rated speed should downclock to JEDEC specs after a failed boot, but again, do check first with the reviews, as no one wants to waste money.  The reason I put this in the review, even though some would view it is a negative thing, is NO ONE should waste their money.  Going from 2133mhz DDR4 to 2933MHZ DDR4 resulted in a 10% gain on CPU-bound tasks.  That's pretty good in the PC world.As it stands, intel's answer to the RYZEN is with their x299 platform, which, while just about to come out on 7/10/2017 (june 10th), is much more buggy in it's current state that it made the original MARCH release of Ryzen look good.  As always with any new platform, there's some good and some bad, and lots of bugs, but most all of the bugs and difficulty with Ryzen's initially launch have been worked out, and it's now polishing up quite nicely!Again, to recap, this is much better value per dollar, about 3x the value per dollar.  All 8-core Ryzens are the same CPU under the hood, some are binned a bit better (binning = classing at factory), and some higher models have a higher turbo or base-clock speed.  You may or may not get an extra 100~200mhz per-core on the higher models (when overclocking!).  The normal max overclock for the Ryzen 8-core series is generally 3.9~4.05 ghz, again, this is board dependent, and can be influenced by many other things such as cooling and how stable your power supply is (yes it does matter, buy a Seasonic PSU if you're going to!).A software note to accompany your new hardware - not for techies!Please install a FRESH copy of your OPERATING SYSTEM when setting up the system for the first time, and make sure to slipstream your RAID drivers into the Windows installation media, or have them handy, or you won't see the RAID array if you're not using one single standard SSD to install Windows to (most people are installing Windows to a single device, so that won't apply to everyone!).  If your existing PC has an OEM copy of Windows (any version), you will *NOT* be able to transfer your Windows Operating System to your new PC hardware without violating the EULA given by OEM Windows licenses.  You will need to have a NEW copy of Windows.  This does *NOT* Apply to the RETAIL version of the Windows OS, which does allow upgrading things like the motherboard.  If you had a RETAIL (not OEM!) copy of Windows 7 or 8.x that you did the free upgrade to Windows 10, you still retail your RETAIL license.OEM Windows license is tied to the motherboard you first installed it on, change that, and you need a new copy.  Please keep this in mind and in-budget, as a non-genuine OS could let viruses, spyware, and other nasty stuff in, or could contain security holes placed in by a nefarious 3rd party if not downloaded from Microsoft media or servers.Windows 7 (and possibly Windows 8.x also), will chastise you and deny updates if it detects this processor, please upgrade to Windows 10.Enjoy your new hardware and know that it will be years and years before this cpu is ever trailing behind enough to not run applications correctly.  Long after the quad-core octo-thread i7's are outmoded, this will still be a quite-viable CPU.Note:  This is typed on a system based on a very-very jealous but somehow still viable 4790k intel-processor based system that hasn't died yet, though, when it does go to the great land of computer hardware in the sky, it will be at-least a Ryzen that replaces it, if not the up-and-coming in August AMD THREADRIPPER CPU, made specifically for High-end-Desktop class PC's.For the gamers:If you currently have an intel 4xxx i5/i7 processor or better, and you're only running quad-core apps, there isn't much out there for you to upgrade to or reason to unless you run many highly-threaded applications, work with video, complex audio, twitch stream, etc, however, the Ryzen processor still offers at-least intel i5/i7 processing-rate-per-core level of performance in most every situation.  Here, I am only bottle-necked by amount of cars I can run simultaneously in Beamng.drive, video encoding/effects speeds, zip compression, etc, as many games aren't yet able to use more than 2~4 cores.  However, if you DO have applications or games, or do twitch streams, or play lots of CITIES SKYLINES (a game able to use LOTS of CPU power!), then go ahead and pick this up with NO regret.  Tomorrow has arrived.Enjoy the return of the 'CPU WARS' folks.  I know I am.*Banana-bench is a command-line physics bench-marking tool, that runs Beamng.drive physics on the cpu, simulating up to about 20 vehicles being processed in real-time without GPU-bottle-necks coming into the equation at all, and is quite similar and can be viewed as the equivalent of WHETSTONE fpu bench-marking.  The floating point units on the AMD RYZEN, unlike the AMD FX/APU series, are VERY good.If you found this review helpful, please push the appropriate button below this review so others may see and read it too.

More than i could of asked for

  Not just hype. This processor shreds thru tasks like nothing!!! The optimizations AMD made since its last generation FX series are HUGE!! I love this processor and on a dollar for dollar basis it blows anything intel has out of the water. Also many peeps complain that it doesnt render games as well as Intels processor, which simply isnt true. Do your research and you quickly find out the reason games dont run as high a frame rate on Ryzen is because when the games were made they werent optimized for Ryzen Processors. Perfect example is Ashes of Singularity , where we saw a 30% increase in performance after optimizing for Ryzen. So there you have a processor that Performs as well or better than intels $1100 processor only for $329. Freaking Amazing!! Thank you AMD!

Overhyped, underdelivers, ongoing compatibility issues
","

  If you game, do not buy this processor, no matter what reviewers tell you. Yes, the performance delta to Intel chips when gaming is relatively close, but it is not zero. When running a 1080ti, this cpu noticeably underperformed compared to a 6600k (overclocked). The overclocking headroom on this chip is low, so you will never achieve Intel speeds. At the end of the day, gaming is still driven by core speeds, not core volume.However, if you are a streamer first, gamer second, or you do significant true multi-tasking/run multi threaded programs, then yes, this chip can be a good value. Essentially: if you were an X299 user and are looking for purely high threadcounts. But if you are looking for the best gaming performance, an 8600k is going to be your better bet if you aren't willing to pay the 8700k premium.Add in all the compatibility/usability issues with the new platform and memory, etc, and it simply isn't worth it.

Best CPU

  I purchased this elsewhere, but this is the best CPU out in my opinion in terms of value for your money. I was able to get it to 3.95ghz at 1.35v using the cooler it comes with. I then upgraded to a AIO 240mm watercooler, and it runs at 4.025ghz at 1.392v.At my overclock, this R7 1700 gets 3% LESS multithreaded performance, and 6% MORE single threaded performance, than the i7-6950X from intel. That cpu costs $1650.~$275 > $1650B350 motherboards are also just as capable as X370, so you can spend less, and get a $100 B350 motherboard as well.I also suggest getting 3200mhz cas 14-16 ram, Ryzen benefits quite a bit from faster ram. Don't get 2133mhz.

  Editing:  This is my Processor in my main workhorse PC.  I am a Professional Videographer for weddings, events, businesses, and many more.  This processor absolutely chews through 4K workloads with amazing render times.  It is very good at applying warp stabilizer in premiere as well as providing a smooth playback while scrubbing(this also depends on your scratch disk hard drive).  I usually apply A TON of adjustment layers to my projects and this processor renders them without a sweat.Gaming:  I have yet to find any game on the market that this CPU is bottle necked by.  I can download any game and be assured that  it will play flawlessly.This CPU also comes with the wraith spire cooler that has RGB led's on it and works like a champ.  I have mine mildly overclocked to 3.7ghz using this cooler and I have never seen it heat up to a point where i felt I needed an aftermarket cooler.Buy this or buy the newer 2700X.

  The price to performance is absolutely phenomenal. I had an Intel 2500K for about 6 years which served me well, however, Intel has really dropped the ball lately with marginal improvements.

It's forward-looking with 8 cores and 16 threads at a price that is a third of Intel's closest competitor, the i7 6900K.

  I dono why they put superior performance in gaming on the page. I had this overclocked to 4.0. My friend and I did some testing, he had a 6700k 4.5. He got over 100 more fps in tests than I did. I had a 7500 i5, and a 1070 later, it got 40 fps in a game called black desert online. My ryzen 7 with a 1080ti, got 17 in the same spot. This cpu is not meant for gaming, it beats older intels at multi tasking. So if you need something that has a better multi thread score then this would be better. Though with the 8700k, I doubt this would get much better on muti threaded tasks. Since this at 4 ghz has a single thread rating of like 1900 on passmark, and the 8700k on stock has 2700 ish, 5ghz would get you like 2900. So a 5ghz 8700k would blow by a 1700 in everything, you would get 100+ fps depending on the game, and be able to keep up in multi threading task.

G.skill Flare X 16gb RAM even has the RYZEN logo on their packages, but they are not compatible with the mobos that claim to be compatible with Ryzen. I'm very disappointed.

  The stock cooler came broken as did the actual chip. The funny part is, is that it's too late for a refund! Stick to intel.

Amazon lies to their customers!
","

  Ended up getting it at the egg, because Amazon decided to conceal the fact that they didn't actually have enough of CPUs on hand to meet the demand of those who pre-ordered the first day.CPU is decent, runs well and runs cool...  Gaming at 1080P and below aren't great options, but who buys an 8 core 16 thread CPU to run games at 900P?Oh and fortunately, this is the one CPU in the line up that actually comes with a fan.

  Two of the fins that have the screws for the wraith cooler came bent so badly there is no way to line up the heatsink to even use this thing.

Rather Pay A Premium Price for A Premium Product (Intel/Nvidia)
","

  I purchased this from another online retailer. This CPU is horrible. It was constantly throttling down to 1.0Ghz per Core, due to excess heat this CPU was putting out. I had it properly cooled using a 420mm Radiator, for the CPU only. This was paired with 2 RX480's on Water, which also burned up! I made a horrible mistake switching to AMD. Don't make the same mistake I did! A premium price is for a premium product, Intel. I guess this CPU does NOT fit an X99 Board, which is stupid!

  AMD products are terrible, NVDA is the best in its class. I've purchased AMD and I regret. I will never purchase any AMD product again. Don't buy their product don't waste your money.

Not for gaming.

  Don't buy if you sole prupose is gaming, the 7700k outperforms it in every resolution by a margin of 20+ fps in every game. I per-ordered it from newegg but, I was disappointed with its gaming performance.

  This has been a great processor so far, still playing around with OC'ing it and probably won't settle on a permanent OC until I get my 2nd set of G Skill FlareX memory for a total of 32 Gigs of ram for my new build.

  90 FPS for gaming at ANY resolution, absolutely superb at everything else, $30 cheaper than the i7 and rocking 4 more cores. It is an absolute belter of a processor, and marks a welcome return by AMD. The fact that Intel only dropped their prices after this was released annoys me more than I thought it would as well!

  Probably the best for the buck CPU out there. Will save you so much money later when you need to upgrade it. Lots of games and applications are becoming more multi-threaded, so this is perfect for anyone. The upgradibility on AMD is outstanding compared to what intel has to offer. I promise you wont regret buying this. For this price, you might as well get 2. Truly an amazing product.
