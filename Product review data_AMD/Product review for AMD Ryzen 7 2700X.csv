Didn't work as intended
","

  I bought this as part of some component upgrades, thinking it would help turn my PC into a space heater for my dorm (just in time for winter). Unfortunately, the stock cooler that came with it works so well that I can now chill beers on top my case. 0/10 would never buy again.

I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade
","

  I just upgraded from a 1700X to a 2700X. With stock clocks, under a full load, the 2700X clock speeds (4Ghz) are 500Mhz faster than with my 1700X (3.5Ghz). And DDR4 memory speed was able to be increased from 2933 to 3200Mhz using 4 x 8GB DDR4 modules. Both of these improvements made the upgrade worth it to me. Turn on Gaming Mode through the use of AMD Ryzen Master Utility and CPU clock speeds increase dynamically up to 4.3Ghz! Needless to say, AMD has outdone themselves this time. I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade :DPROs- Price for performance can't be beat vs. 1st gen Ryzen and existing Intel CPUs; i.e. the 2700X is $30 cheaper than a 8700K- Backward compatible with X370 and B350 motherboards (with the right BIOS update)- Noticeable higher clock speeds vs. 1700X, especially under full load - up to 500Mhz faster clock speeds!- Precision Boost 2.0 and XFR2 are built into the CPU, which means these features are intact and work even with an older X370 motherboard- Improved compatibility with higher DDR4 memory speeds vs. 1700X- Operating temperatures are about the same in spite of the fact the CPU having a 10W higher TDP rating vs. 1700X- AMD's Ryzen Master Utility really does work!- Wraith Prism CPU cooler is included and is adequate for stock CPU speedsCONs- Very limited overclocking headroom unless extreme cooling is used; i.e. LN02- Anticipated future release of the higher clocked 2800X variant may cause buyer's remorse to those that just bought a 2700X- Motherboard related and not really an issue of the 2700X; the X470 chipset is not really an improvement in most areas and features vs. the X370 chipset- Best DDR4 memory speeds can only be achieved by using 2 of the 4 DIMM slots; 3666Mhz has been achieved with 2 memory sticks, but only 3200Mhz has been achieved using 4 memory sticks- No native increase in supported PCI-E lanes (24) from the CPU (not including X470 or the upcoming Z490 chipset improvements)Bottom line, is it worth upgrading to the 2700X?  It all depends on what PC hardware you have now and how you want to spend your money.  For example, if you own a GTX1060 or RX 570, a GPU upgrade will most likely give you a much better performance increase than upgrading from a 1700X to a 2700X.  But, if you have a PC that's 5 years or older, I would say it might be worth upgrading if you have a need for multitasking on your computer.  If you game, stream, play music, while running hardware monitoring tools all at the same time, then the 2700X is definitely for you!

  Upgraded to the AMD Ryzen 7 2700x from my old Intel i7 3770k. My old system could still handle gaming and proccessing ok, But i always notices my CPU at Idle would be utilizing 20-30% of its resources. This chip completely destroys anything I throw at it with ease and it does not even break a sweat. Not only is this chip great for gaming but other multitasking. If you like to game but do a lot of other things like streaming your games, video editing, or other work related solutions then you cant go wrong!

  So this is my first ever Ryzen build (2700X) and my 1st 8 core CPU. No thanks to Intel for keeping their 8 core CPUs out of mainstreamers reach with ridiculous prices.My previous system was a i5 6600K @4.7Ghz, awesome build for just gaming.Anyways, after assembling the system and powering it on for the very first time, monitor did not show anything. The system had power and all the fancy LED lights and fans were on. So what I did was swap my RAMs from A1 B1 to A2 and B2. Then the system boosted just fine! At first I thought the lastest BIOS update would fix it. But even after the latest BIOS update the system doesn't post if I install the RAMs in A1 and B1. After you move the Ram sticks to A2B2 you might want to take out the battery, disconnect the power cord and reset the CMOS by sorting the two pins.Coming from the Intel platform I must say, the BIOS is a bit different on Ryzen. On the Skylake, I only had to adjust vcore for CPU voltage. But in Ryzen it seems there's a second voltage to look out for, SoC voltage. I manually set my voltage to 1.375 but HWinfo has shown the max it hit as 1.5v so I guess I need some more tweaking to do.I'm using a really old Crucial 2400Mhz cl16 Ram which I bought when Intel Skylake first came out. I was able to OC it to 2700Mhz with the Intel system but couldn't do it on the Ryzen, just didn't post. Hopefully later if the Ram prices drop I would upgrade it to 3200mh c14 Ram.After setting up the drivers I had Windows update running in background and I thought of testing out AC Origins on this system. I was gaming for a about 5 mins and notice that all fans including the CPU fan had stopped for whatever reason. And because of this the CPU temp was well over 90 degrees, so I powered it down and let it cool. After fully updating windows, I tested the game again and everything was good!I'm going to install Adobe apps and will update more info soon.One of most annoying issues I got is that Asus AI suite, CPU-Z and HWinfo shows completely different vcore and CPU speed readings. So I have no idea which one is right. I have yet to install Ryzen master.Oh and right now I'm using the stock cooler that came with the 2700X and idle temps at at 43 celcius ambient at being around 24. Have to use this cooler until I get the AM4 mounts for my NH-D15.Thanks AMD!UPDATE 23-May-2018:I got the mounting kit for my Noctua NH-D15 and now my system idles at 30 celcius while being OC'ed to 4.22Ghz at 1.4v in BIOS! Huge thermal headroom compared to the stock cooler. When all cores are stressed to 100% it peaks at 60 degress! With stock cooler without OC it goes into 80s.UPDATE 29-May-2018 OVERCLOCKING:When i first got the CPU i found that 1.425v in BIOS with LLC on Auto gave me a rock solid 4.2Ghz OC. But then I kept seeing this strange vcore changes. At idle, the vcore stays around 1.4v to1.412v. But when I stress the CPU with any intensive task, the vcore drops and stays around 1.362v! That was weird. Less vcore with stress and more vcore when idle. lolSo what I did was after a couple of tests, I manually set my vcore in BIOS to 1.387v and LLC to 5 and now the system always at this vcore even when stressed to 100% and even in idle! NICE. I found that LLC5 was needed to keep my vcore there. When i set the LLC to 4, the vcore drops down from 1.387v to 1.362v when stressed and causes Prime95 to crash. With LLC5 it stays at 1.387v when stressed with Prime95 and I didn't even had to raise the vcore!So in short, please don't leave the vcore and LLC on Auto. When you OC please set your LLC too.

Ridiculous!

  Ridiculous!Was planned to be an 8700k build, parts and everything picked out but after learning about all the improvements Zen+ ""actually made"" I decided to go Ryzen this time, and a first time for AMD.Back in early 2017 when I built my Kaby Lake rig i remember loving what Ryzen was trying to do but I was not however ready to get on a platform that was still teething as it was and thought to myself that in the future if it can become more optimized i would totally consider making Ryzen my next build, what i did not think would happen was for pretty much all my gripes i had with gen 1 to actually get fixed! I know right, its not even ""Gen2"" yet only a refresh and already large improvements have been made. This is why competition is so healthy!The other thing was gaming! Just raw straight up gaming, this is where I start to notice ""hear say confusion"" so I am just going to say this flat out... With or without coffee lake's existence, regardless, and even if we are talking gaming only, the 2700x is still what anyone would have to refer to as a gaming beast! Yes, @ 1080p the 8700k beats it by like 15 - 20 frames in quite a few titles however, anything over 1080p (1440p/4k) and those gains from the 8700k shrink big time, more like 3 - 7 frames now but everything else it makes up for as a CPU as a whole, knock out!! It IS the best mainstream CPU on the market for everything and anything all around period! Okey, so if all you care about your CPU is the highest frames for 1080p gaming and you are NOT an AMD fanboy and thats it then pretty much totally go with a coffee lake chip!  For everyone else, Ryzen 2,000 series is the better offer. imo :)Simply put, this 2700x is ridiculous!

Finally an AMD chip that is worth getting over Intel!
","

  First AMD processor I have put in my system in a very long time, have been using Intel exclusively for the last several system upgrades. I am glad I made the switch. The first thing that I noticed was that multi-tasking is noticeably faster. I don't detect any noticeable difference in games as far as fps goes.I put this proc in a MSI x470 Carbon Pro motherboard. Put a Corsair H75 water cooler on it. Installed some ripjaws 3200 ram and this system runs perfectly. Using HWiNFO64 to log my temps, I have never seen the CPU hit the 70 C mark, even after several multi hour long gaming sessions. This was not the case for my intel system with the same cooler. It would often get close to 80 C and cause hiccups when I was playing a game and trying to stream at the same time.If I had one suggestion it would be this; do not go cheap on the ram. Ryzen's advantage over an intel system is the memory architecture. Use this advantage by put some quality ram in the system. It was a little on expensive side but I opted for G-Skill Ripjaws 3200 CAS 14.

  upgraded from a 1600x to this and couldn't be happier. the prism cooler that comes with the 2700x is nearly on par with the like cm 212 evo. you honestly don't need an aftermarket cooler unless you want to push really high overclocks. i actually replaced my 212 evo i had for my 1600x with the included prism cooler. and really, with the way xfr 2 and performance enhancement works with ryzen+ you really don't need to overclock. i've been maintaining 4ghz+ in all the games i've played so far. which have been pubg, world of warcraft, counter-strike go, and farcry 5. the 2700x is simply a beast of a processor.

The included cooler feels like it's got a nice build quality
","

  Bought this as an upgrade from a Core i5 4690K. The difference is night and day. I can't speak for overclocking as I'm waiting for the AM4 bracket for my AIO cooler to come in. The included cooler feels like it's got a nice build quality. I don't care for RGB lighting everywhere but, if you are a fan of it, then this is a nice looking cooler to go in your case.I'm getting consistently smoother frames in Overwatch and FFXV. In Overwatch I would dip from 144Hz to 60-70 in the intense fights. I haven't seen my frames drop at all since getting this new CPU. FFXV is seeing a higher framerate overall, also with no dips from what I can see. With my old 4690K my CPU was at 90-100% usage just from running OW, FFXV, and PUBG (haven't tested PUBG yet). If Avira or MBAM decided it wanted to scan in the middle of a game.....consoles would get better frame rates. There's no doubt anymore with this processor. I setup Plex Media Server and was streaming two videos from it and didn't notice any degradation on my games. The headroom on this is amazing.This is the first AMD processor I've owned. If they can keep their momentum going then it more than likely won't be the last one that I own.

Photo editing PC platform with AMD 2700X
","

  I just finalized my new PC build using the AMD Ryzen 2700x with the goal of photo and video editing. I also considered the Intel i7 8700k which slightly higher single core score, whereas the 2700X beats it at multi core performance. I mostly use Photoshop, Lightroom CC classic and some other photo editing software suites and while they are not yet fully optimized for multi core operation, I’m better prepared for the future with the 2700X. I use this CPU together with the MSI x470 gaming plus motherboard and it runs without any issues. With the fan that comes with this CPU and without any over cloxking, the standby temperature of the CPU is around 31C which steps up to just below 50F under load. Since I’m not using this system for gaming, I do not really need forced water cooling. The system runs quiet and fast. The attached photo shows that the CPU fan that comes with this CPU has multiple colors which is nice.

  Seriously, I am beyond happy that I dared dip a toe into the red team. People complain about how it's harder to do because of memory issues and that you have to be more stringent when choosing RAM, but I can vote with confidence that it's just the usual talk coming from the general populace that's mostly tech-illiterate and doesn't know how to compare numbers.I can say that I've had no memory issues, I've had no issues with software or installs past initial setup, and THIS B*TCH RUNS WINDOWS 7 ALONGSIDE EVERY OTHER OS WITH EASE! I honestly cannot understand where all of the complaints are coming from, since I have installed six different Linux distro's and everything from Windows 7 to the current Garbaggio 10 update and have had no issues whatsoever. Even when playing around with my Intel build (i7-7700), it took me at least an hour or two in order to install Windows 7. It took maybe six minutes to prep an install for Win7 on Ryzen 2.The big one: performance. If you haven't seen the videos on YouTube, I'll cut it short. The 2700X has around 80 - 90% of the performance of an i9-9900k, both in stock and overclocked standards. No joke. I've rendered video, I've edited 4K photos, I've done multitasking to the point of filling up two monitors with at least 10 active programs a piece, and I can tell you that those numbers are pretty accurate. Oh, and you're paying roughly half the price if you buy this over the i9, so there's that.For anyone that wants to buy one, I'll give you the biggest piece of advice out there. Ready? R E A D. If you're not sure about something, go back and double-check. Triple- or quadruple-check if you have to, but be sure about what you're buying. One of the safest bets on memory is LPX memory, specifically from Corsair. If you buy a set of the Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM, I honestly fail to see where you could go wrong in terms of compatibility.Bottom-line: This is SOOOOOOOO much better than Intel. I got a beefy cooler, I've overclocked mine with no cooling issues, and most motherboard companies out there offer tools for those who prefer Windows 7 whereas Intel will shove Windows 10 down your throat like a bad weekend in Amsterdam. Oh, and I used the $200 to buy a GTX 1060TI on sale, so that's good.

Box said Ryzen 7 2700x, but a different cpu was in the box
","

  UPDATE: 2/28/2019 - This is now a FIVE star review. Please read the initial review and the update below.Initial review:The one star rating is not reflective of the 2700x or of Amazon, for that matter. Mistakes happen. I just want to to draw attention to this.Just a few days ago, I had finally bought all of the pieces of my new computer and was going to build it just the other night. I hit a snag pretty quick when the processor wouldn't fit into the cpu socket of the motherboard (ASUS Crosshair VII Hero). I visually checked the pins and noticed that the layout did not line up with the socket. Imagine my surprise when I noticed ""A4 3300"" written very lightly on the cpu surface. It seems that someone duped Amazon by returning their 2700x cpu, and switching it our for a very similar looking A4 3300 (an apu introduced back in 2011), then getting their money back for a 2700x. I've started the return process and the cpu is in the mail back to Amazon, and I'll update this review depending on how this is handled. I think that is fair. However, I have to say I'm glad this happened. Hopefully, the good folks at Amazon can track the sku number of the part when it gets back to them and trace it back to the customer who returned it to them beforehand. I hope you can do that, Amazon, because they got a free Ryzen 2700x out of you. Lesson learned for me: Check every detail of a purchase as quickly as possible when it arrives.UPDATE: About 5 days after I shipped the processor to Amazon they faithfully refunded my money without any hassles. I had to get the Ryzen 7 2700x from another place because I didn't know how long it would take to get a refund from Amazon and I was anxious to get my computer together, but I can tell you that it runs just as great as everyone here is claiming it does. It is an amazing processor. Five stars, definitely. I also give a 5 star review to Amazon's return service. I'm very impressed, and I hope they catch whoever it was that sent that wrong processor back to them, initially. Thank you, Amazon!

Better than 8700k for the price
","

  First off, to all the intel fanboys, yes we know the 8700k is the world grand champion for ultra high fps 1080p gaming when paired with an overpowered gpu.... but... this is by no means a slouch!  It's cheaper to build an awesome gaming/streaming rig with this and in the end your streaming results will be better.  I have been using this cpu now for a few weeks and frankly I can't see why anyone would go with intel right now... 8700k costs more and doesn't come with a cooler...this costs less and comes with a good cooler...  sure you can have 10 - 20 more fps when paired with a 1080ti but whats 120 vs 140 fps?  In some games this cpu even will beat out the 8700k btw so it's not really that far behind in gaming, but holy crap is this a multitasking beast... I can be rendering a video, playing games and streaming all at once with virtually no performance hit to the game...  and interestingly enough newer games seem to be using the 16 threads this offers... universe sandbox 2 will use all 16 threads and in intense simulation will nearly max it out... I asked myself then, what if I only had 6 cores like the 8700k?  ... I can tell you what, the game would have suffered.Cinebench scores reflect the true  power this cpu offers... this one out of the box hit 1809cb points... a click or two in the bios and managed 1851 while still using stock clocks.... just enabling precision boost overdrive.Reasons to buy:  Great price, can be paired with a reasonable b350, comes with cooler..... simply add a good gpu and you have a beast of a pc.

  General:I just upgraded from my old AMD FX 6300 build and the difference truly is night and day! Aesthetically, the prism cooler that came included is really gorgeous, though figuring out how to control the colors may prove to be somewhat difficult (I'm still reading up on it, and trying to snyc the colors with my ASUS motherboard).Installation:Installation was a breeze, this goes for most CPU's these days, but nonetheless it wasn't a complicated procedure and should be noted. There was thermal paste already applied on the wraith cooler, however, I generally don't trust pre-applied thermal pastes, so I removed the paste from the cooler it and replaced it with my own on the CPU.Performance:My computer has been running for only two days, so while I can't comment on too much performance wise I'll be sure to update my experience as time goes by. So far, it is a phenomenal chip for what I use it for. I do a lot of development work and some casual gaming, which gets tackled efficiently. My idle temps have hovered around low to mid 30s C, and I don't reach 70 C under load (games such as BF1, R6, CSGO, etc). I don't do any video editing at the moment, but I do photography edits via Photoshop and those run perfectly smooth (not quite as demanding as video obviously). NOTE: There are instances I have heard of where drivers for Adobe products cause serious performance issues for AMD users in programs such as premiere pro, so be sure to research these if that would be an issue for you.Overall:I definitely recommend this chip to anybody who has similar workloads and daily tasks as me. If you're going to be doing more than just gaming I would absolutely say this over Intel's flash ship counterpart.

Was great until mine shorted out. Amazon QC is nonexistent for PC components.
","

  This is a post will discredit Amazon a bit. I bought this CPU and it worked great for almost a month until it shorted itself out. I have had many issues buying PC parts from Amazon and I don't understand why. GPUs shipped broken, monitors busted... Anyway, this is supposed to be a review about the CPU itself.I actually got my currently-working 2700X from eBay on a sale. It's fantastic! 8 cores, 16 threads of 4.4GHz without even manually overclocking; the CPU overclocks itself better than I could!Games? It does not hit the extremely high FPS that Intel CPUs might, but it stays VERY stable. What does that mean? For example, an Intel CPU in Battlefield 1 will hit as high as 180FPS, but sometimes drops to a gross 40FPS. This Ryzen 2700X cannot hit 180FPS, but goes as high as 160FPS and only goes as low as 120FPS in even the most demanding parts of the game. If you care about frame drops, the Ryzen never has them. It's hard to articulate smoothness versus raw FPS maximums. It's like a smooth curve rather than a jagged graph.Productivity? This thing chews through 3D renders and video editing processing.Price? I bought this at $350, and even then it was a steal.Should you buy it? Definitely.

  **To control the RGB lighting on the cooler you only need to connect the USB connection to a motherboard USB Header and download the Wraith Prism Software from their site..

AMD finally wins in price and performance.
","

  Coming from a Haswell-E 5820K, there is a significant boost in performance with the 2700X. This is my first AMD chip since the Athlon XP series. AMD has made a comeback in a big way and I'm happy to say they are finally able to seriously compete with Intel.I highly underestimated just how much the 5820K was bottlenecking my SLI GTX 970's. My average frame rate, depending on the game, has jumped 10 - 30fps. A good example would be Deus Ex Mankind Divided. A horribly optimized game that ran sub 40fps on the same SLI setup with the 5820K. That same game now never dips below 50fps, with an average of 65 - 70fps. Impressive.The included cooler is quite good. Idle sits at about 45c, which may seem high but the delta between idle and full load is really low for a stock air cooler. Even with the stock TIM, full load in games hit about 55 - 58c, and I haven't seen it go higher than that. I have not tried any stress tests to see how high it really goes but I don't consider a stress test to be a good indicator of how it's going to perform in real world application. For me that's games, and in that respect, the stock cooler is plenty effective even at the 4.15Ghz boost clock.Bottom line is, yes the new Intel chips do VERY slightly better in SOME benchmarks (and the Ryzen 7 does better in others), but if you're like me and have outgrown the chase for meaningless benchmark numbers in the context of real world usage, then you will not be disappointed with this chip.

  This CPU is an amazing chip. I've worked with a lot of cpus and this one destroys absolutely everything. It has great ram support and it legitimately destroys the i7 6700k out of the box. If you are looking for a good motherboard, I really liked the ASRock X470 Master SLI/AC. I've built a lot of systems and I loved this motherboard. Unfortunately, this motherboard is a newegg exclusive but its really a good board. I used my old 3200 mhz g G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 16GB memory. It runs at 3200 mhz by changing a single bios setting. This system is very stable and runs great. At first, I was sceptical about leaving Intel CPUs but I'm glad I did now. If your on the fence about this purchase, you should just go ahead and buy it. It's really the best value and performance in it's class. Plus it has an AWESOME stock cooler.

  I was building a gaming rig.  Didn't need the most advanced CPU or most expensive so I went with the 2700x.  I've been using it for over a year now and liked it enough that I helped my son build his rig using the same processor.I will say it runs a bit hot, but only during heavy gaming.  I normally hear headphones during gaming so I can barely hear it, if at all.  Compound this with a Vega 56 GPU, which runs even hotter and likely causes the most fan noise during gaming.I don't game so much now, but I want a very solid system and this rig has been excellent.  It hasn't crashed on me once.  I work from home now with covid so I am on my computer for at least 5 hours a day, including weekends.I won't buy this one again, but I will buy the next gen AMD processor when I am ready to upgrade.

I built in my desktop on February 2019 , so excited to be using it for work ( Graphic Designer and Video Editing production) everything was going good until last week when the PC suddenly shuts down... Sent it for an evaluation and the test showed that the AMD Processor was DEAD...Contacted Amazon Support and the only response I had was to email a department that would send me a response ( still waiting after 3 days ). SO are we paying all this money for something that is supposed to last only half a year? THIS IS CRAZY.  Was having high hopes here AMD.

Wonderfull Chip and cooler. Probably best not to use the stock thermal compoud though.
","

  The first PC I ever built I used an AMD Athlon processor in, and I loved it. When I found out about the Ryzen processors I was excited to see what they could do, and I was not disapointed. This chip feels very compitent. I put it into a gaming system, and I have had no issues with it. I also like the cooler. It looks good, and seems to function well. My only complaint about this setup is the factory applied thermal compound. I know, wipe it off and apply third party, but Im not over clocking, so I figured it would work for my purposes, and I was not disapointed, that is untill I had to swap a faulty motherboard. When I removed my cooler, it pulled the whole chip out of the socket. I was terified thinking it had dammaged something. Thankfully all pins were in place. Then came the hard part. It turns out that the factory thermal paste had spread all across the chip, and melted down the sides. I have never seen factory paste do that. The real problem though was that it somehow formed a sort of glue that had now bonded the CPU and cooler togather. They were not coming appart for anything (at least anything I was willing to try on my $300+ chip). Eventually I was able to disolve the thermal paste and save my chip using some very light heat and a little alcohol and a piece of dental floss. Aparently this happens more often then I had realized because there was a whole subredit about how to fix it (Thank you Redit ;-) . In the end it all worked out well and I have everything back up and running in my new MoBo. It was just an experience I will not forget.

Just buy it.

  This is one more victory for team red. I never thought that I would live to see the day where I could purchase an eight core, 16 thread processor that can comfortably sustain a 3.9ghz o.c. on an air cooler for under $200. There was once a time where the perception was that AMD was for the budget pc user/gamer that couldn't necessarily afford an Intel cpu. Well, those days are officially behind us because the Ryzen series is leaving intel in the dust. On Cinebench, running at 3.9ghz, this processor scored a 3961, and in doing so, outperforms several i7 processors. Although, for single core applications, intel chips tend to have a narrow lead, in multithreading, Ryzen blows comparable intel chips away. If you're looking for an excellent chip for under $200, look no further. Btw, the included cooler is massive, and it looks pretty sick with the rgb.

  The 

AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler - YD270XBGAFBOX

   is the Best CPU for any task one could imagine and in my opinion absolutely put the competition to shame with it's inclusion of the Wraith Prism(RGB) fan. The fan actually does an adequate job of cooling this beast of a processor and that speaks worlds for AMD's commitment to the customer.Amazing processor, truly, just nothing else to say about it.

  7/15/2020 UPDATE: So regarding the whole offset voltage thing. It seems you may find mixed results. Yes the decreased voltage reduces heat. Reduce heat means higher potential clock right? Wrong. In situations where the CPU was already more than capabable of handling itself to where it will not harm itself even running full speed(stock) under heavy load. It changes freq. But the problem comes with the voltage requests of the motherboard. The CPU will also downclock if it does not get the voltage it needs. ""But you just enable PBO!"" Yes that loosens the power caps but remember, volts = watts x amps and amps = watts/volts. So heres how it can possiBly screw you if you don't balance the reduced voltage with the increased amperage.  Your MOBO is still requesting the same stock voltage of say 1.58v(my highest hwinfo64 reading) at 138w(PBOenabled. highest hwinfo64 reading) @ at full load causing almost 95amps draw. And thats a problem vs stock where the lack of voltage isnt causing power demands that just cant be met. Causing downclocking. And also reducing  XFR to almost zero Benifet since the CPU will refuse to clock any higher if it feels any of its parameters that would allow it to aren't Being met. One of which is caused By the reported SV12 Voltage bing lower than the VID. Making the CPU think its reached max power already since hardware limitations didnt allow for an increasing in amps to compensate for the reduced voltage. Which I admit, a good power supply will help reduce the issue.In other words, yes you are shedding heat. Great if you dont need the extra horsepower and want to extend life. But if thats not for you, then I wouldnt recomend any voltage offset over -.0500v. Beyond that your just asking to starve the CPU of power. Check GamersNExus for Benchmarks on this exact scenario.So with the stock cooler. MSI b450m Tomahawk:My temps are around 40-45c idle. Expected. Loads under gaming 60-70c. p95 75c.ALL PRETTY DANG GOOD FOR A STOCK COOLER STOCK SETTINGSMy boost clocks are hitting 4.25-4.35ghz consistently during gaming. Which is amazing. I noticed a HUGE difference since I upgraded from a FX 6350 to this monster.I recently tried a -.0750v offset and so far its very stable and shaved off about 3c-5c on all my temps. And the boost clocks seems to be running about the same. Benchmarks seem to be unaffected as well. I will remove the negative voltage offset as soon as my MSI Frozr L heatsink comes in tomorrow. There is no need to overclock this thing. DO NOT BY AN X if you want to overclock. Buy the non X save $20+ then OC to the X specs. Easy as that. The way ryzens are designed is to self OC to its limits. If you are running hot with high voltages GOOD. Its constantly pushing its limits to get the speeds it needs based on demand. I hit 1.5v+ during gaming all the time. Brief voltage and temp spikes will not hurt this baby at all. I love the way they designed this thing to run.All in all the Ryzens are great I HIGHLY recommend them. Save yourself hundreds and go with a Ryzen.

No brainer upgrade from Ryzen 5 1600 for the price
","

  I am fortunate to live near a MC so I have been rocking a Ryzen 5 1600 that I picked up for $70. It was a great upgrade from my old i5 2500K and I have had no issues with it at all. This 2700x went on sale at MC for $129 but Amazon is only $135 after 15% back on my Prime CC. Saves me time, gas, and toll. Plus I sold the Xbox Game Pass and free game already, as well as my Ryzen 5 1600, making my out of pocket cost on this 2700x upgrade only $50. Amazing deal.Processor is blazing fast. I gained two more cores and 4 more threads, as well as a PBO capable processor. Make sure to upgrade your motherboard bios to the latest possible prior to upgrading if you are coming from a 1st gen Ryzen setup. Dropped the new processor in and booted with no issues. I was stuck at 3.4 GHz on the old Ryzen 5 1600, topping out at 3.8 GHz on a manual overclock. I'm getting 4.25 GHz on all cores now with PBO. Processor still stays at a nice and cool 45 degrees C on a full load.Amazing value. I may have to pick up another to replace the file server's 1st gen Ryzen too.

Overclocker Enthusiasts Beware!
","

  This is an amazing chip for what it does at this price-point. I'm not talking budget-level performance either. This is enthusiast-grade performance without the nasty Intel price-points. And the chip is designed to provide almost all of the performance it's capable of out of the box, without having to do anything with it (great for basic consumers who don't want to fuss with settings and whatnot).Overclocker enthusiasts beware though; this chip is designed to run itself to the limits. So on the one hand, it's awesome that you're basically getting almost all the performance it's capable of out of the box (CPU/case cooling being the limiting factor; your mileage may vary). But for those of you who love to tinker with your components to try to get the most performance out of them; overclocking Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series is basically pointless. There's very minuscule performance to be gained, and in quite a few cases you actually lose performance even with higher clocks. You're better off overclocking your RAM as that is more effective at boosting the compute performance... for this I highly recommend you check out your motherboard vendor's Quality Verification Listing for compatible RAM. Go check out Gamers Nexus' Youtube channel for more on this.

Going on fourth AMD Ryzen build.  Very pleased!

  I'm going on my fourth AMD Ryzen build with three of them using the Ryzen 7 2700X.  All of the 2700Xs are overclocked at 4.3GHZ with liquid cooling.  Extremely pleased with performance, stability, price, availability and support.  I know AMD plans to support AM4 platform until at least 2020.  I look forward to upgrading with lastest Ryzen at 7nm or smaller maybe in 2020.  So these builds are good at least to 2022 or later I would guess without having to upgrade motherboards.  If you account for all the parameters for choosing a CPU platform, AMD Ryzen totally blows away Intel platforms which are stuck at 14nm.The only downside is I wish the CPU didn't include the Wraith Prism LED Cooler as it is such a waste since I'm always building these as liquid cooled.  I got all these air coolers with no use for them.  No one to give them to as not many Alaskans build their own computers.

One star for Amazon service, five stars for the product

  CPU is great. Frankly unbelievable value. Upgraded from i3-4170, replaced only MB, CPU, and memory (Gigabyte B450 AORUS PRO WIFI  and G.Skill Ripjaws V 16GB to go along with this 2700x). Somehow even existing Windows 10 install did not complain, started without any issues, and did not ask for any new drivers. The improvement in speed is obvious even without running any benchmarks -- stuffs just loads faster and everything seems more responsive (even, again, without re-installing Windows).The reason for one star -- the CPU was advertised with a game bundle at the time of purchase (seller was Amazon). Amazon CS acknowledged this in multiple chats and emails (2 weeks worth of that). The story seems to be that Amazon ran out of game codes and was waiting for more. In each new chat or email exchange Amazon simply kicks the can down the road -- something along the lines of ""we will resolve this in 2-3 business days"".

8-Cores, what's more to say

  Well I got this for myself along with a Crosshair VII Hero Wifi board but I made the mistake of buying the board and CPU when I was working 60 hour weeks. Right after the return window expired I was able to properly test the board, which was defective. It took Asus 2 months and 2 RMA trips to get the board straightened out. Shame on you Asus. The only lesson I learned is I won't buy a motherboard unless I have enough time to test it.My brother upgraded to a huge 32"" 4k display but he was still rocking a Core i7-2600k and a GTX 970. For Christmas I gave him the working Ryzen setup along with 16gb of G.Skill Flare X 3200mhz cl 14 memory, and a GTX 1080 handmedown because I found a 1080ti before the stock dried up. I had never seen him so happy, which made the upgrade worth for him worth it. It makes sense since the 2700x performs the same as the i9-9900k and i7-8700k at 4k when gaming, mainly because the GPU is the bottleneck.Before I gave him the setup I did some memory testing of my own with a set of G.Skill 3600mhz cl15 memory. I was able to get the system to boot while running the DOCP profile but at such a high speed the board would sometimes kick the memory settings out with the overclocking failed message. Otherwise I was able to run a few stress tests and benchmarks with the memory at 3600mhz and tight cas latency timings. If I manually set the speeds to 3466mhz cl15 then I had no trouble at all. Setting the memory properly did make a difference with the Unigine Superposition score, but it was maybe a 1.5% difference at the most.With the DDR4-3200 cl Flare or another capable B-Die set of RAM, the 2700x is about the same as having 2x 6700k or 4790k processors. The XFR2 boost works too well. I can't wait to see what Zen2 has in store.

  Using this with Asus ROG 470 mobo, and all works fine with Wiin7.  Excellent value for desktop or decent gaming rig.In order to install Win7 you will have to locate some of the drivers yourself, but they are available.  Microsoft will try to make you believe Win7 won't work on these newer Ryzens, but absolutely not true - I'm writing this on the Win7 Ryzen machine.  In fact a lot of benchmarks come in better running Win7 rather than Win10.Get your updates from Wsus Offline and you'll keep your rig updated just fine. Asus has an EZ Installer utility that will add the USB drivers to your Win7 installer ISO - Or just install Win7 from a CD and that will work as well, then add the USB stuff later.GREAT value, and we'll be ordering more.

  My son was excited about getting this processor. The shipping and receiving process was quick. Needles to say as soon as it arrived he got right to work on installing it. We both struggled like all hell to get the damn clips to latch on and push down on the lever. After several times of taking turns getting it on and thinking this feels to tight to fit on. But I got it on and we both thought finally, it's smooth sailing from here. Or so we thought. My son and I are standing on the side of the case watching the pretty rgb lights of the CPU fan. When all of a sudden we hear the retention clip snap back and see the piece of the bracket that holds the CPU fan in place flying across the side of the computer case. The look of disappointment on my son's face instantly puts me  on high level THIS IS BS mode. I mean I was pissed. Now he can't game on his computer because theirs no way to keep the cooler on the processor. AMD needs to make this right by sending us replacement brackets for making the retention clips unnecessarily tight.

Perfect Editing CPU, Fantastic Gaming CPU

  So I bought this processor purely because Ryzen has a pattern of much better multi-core performance over Intel (even though per-core strength is typically weaker than the Intel equivalent from this generation), and if you're the type that will be doing any kind of creative work with Adobe, you want a processor like this.At over $100 cheaper than the i7-8700K, it is about 10% less powerful in gaming and simple desktop performance, but you can actually get 5% or better workstation performance than an Intel CPU. Not much of a gain, but price-to-performance in that category is really hard to pass up when you're talking about saving $100 and getting a CPU cooler included with the processor.I put that extra $100 towards my RAM and currently run 32GB of Vengeance DDR4 and am able to load all photo and video editing apps by Adobe at the same time in less than 45 seconds. Shut down time is less than 7 seconds with all apps closed, I can immediately start using my PC after log-in, and it takes less than a minute to get to that point. Zero issues after a month of use and I couldn't be happier. No need to overclock so far. It's insanely fast and totally stable.Using on an ROG Crosshair VII Motherboard with an RTX 2080 Super and RM750 Gold.

I paired this with a crosshair Hero VII Mobo so I can fiddle around with overclocking and I installed 6 SDDs  Base clock is around 3.6 GHz and starts you at 2400 RAM Mhz. Unlike Intel, AMD chips really like faster RAM.  I paired this with 32 GB of 3200 Mhz Ripjaws Ram and increased the Ram speed.Very easy within the Bios to increase CPU speed to 4.0 GHz with very little rise in CPU temperature.  Very smooth gaming and stunning speed when rendering video. The Ryzen 7 with its 8 cores was 400% faster at video rendering than my old Intel 7 CPU.  I did try boosting to 4.3 Ghz and 4.2 Ghz but was unable to completely stabilize the system.  Found it to be rock solid at 4.0 GHZ and left it there.  For the huge $$$ savings compared to Intel chips and the increased cores, this is a no brainer buy. AMD you have converted me!

  Up and running a few weeks now, boot is near instantaneous once BIOS posts (note, using ADATA SX8200 M.2 NVM SSD).  Paired with an ASUS ROG Crosshair Hero VII w/WiFi, and 16GB (2x8GB) Corsair Vengeance 3GHz DDR4.The good:Pretty much everything.  Heatsink and fan are of very nice quality, very quiet, very nice looking, and although I'm not usually a fan of lighting gizmos, the RGB manages to look sleek and not childish.  Runs below 40C, even under moderate load, at stock clocks.Instructions for heatsink/fan were not clear, particular with regards to RGB connection, nor orientation of cooler bracket (this is important to make sure it doesn't fall off).  However, I figured it out.  I have built several systems over the years, the last being a Phenom II x940BE (yeah, it's been a while).Have had one issue (?)...random, silent reboot in the middle of the night....there is a known issue with Ryzen on Linux and long idle states resulting in processor voltage instability.  Not sure if it's related, hasn't happened in the weeks since, could be a fluke or me misinterpreting the systemd logs.Overall, at $299 it's a fantastic processor + heatsink combo, zero regrets.  Not an AMD fanboy, but mostly not a fan of Intel for their past sleazy business practices.

  I've spent a lot of money in the past for performance versus price. Until this CPU came along I was always on the other side of the fence. My first AMD was a Sempron and wasn't that impressive until I upgraded it to the Athlon 64X2-4600. It was the fastest thing I'd ever bought until I purchased this Ryzen 7 2700X. Turned out to be the best number crunching CPU I owned for the money. I was very impressed by it's performance and truly didn't expect any big change. The promises posted by AMD were spot on considering typical sales pitches by other prominent companies.

Good bang for buck, just some notes
","

  I chose this card because I wanted a powerful workstation that could handle a lot of multitasking. This has good speeds, but more appealing to me was the fact that it has 8 cores. So while I think this is a fine CPU for gaming, it should also be able to handle a lot of different tasks that require a powerful CPU.It seems fast and my benchmark tests are good. But I would just note two things for everyone:1) This CPU does not feature integrated graphics support. You need a separate GPU. Otherwise, if you try to build a system with this processor but no graphics card, you're not going to get a video signal.2) I found the installation of the ""Wraith Prism Cooler"" a bit confusing. I thought I had latched it into place when I hadn't. I noticed my Ryzen 2700X was running around 50C idle or higher, which seemed too hot to me. So I latched the cooler down in the opposite direction, which did take a little force, and temperatures dropped to around 40C or less. So be mindful of that.All in all, I carefully chose this card by comparing benchmarks speeds to my budget to try to get the fastest card with the most cores for an affordable price. I think I succeeded.

2nd Gen Ryzen has Arrived
","

  I was an AMD fan for years but jumped off the train a few years ago in favor of  Intel.  The first gen of the Zen architecture, had some issues, particularly with ram so I held off.  This 2nd gen is fantastic.  I also made the decision to give the included cooler a try after water-cooling my builds for years.  Again, I wasn't disappointed.  The CPU stays in the 30's (C) and it looks cool!  Make sure your motherboard supports 2nd gen Ryzen.  I bought an x470 board so no issues but an older x370 will likely need a bios update.I have played around with overclocking this chip and haven't nearly experimented enough to render a verdict but my quick assessment is there isn't much overhead to do so, certainly not without a superior cooler.  With that said, it performs like a champ right out of the box!  If you don't plan to overclock, maybe look at the 2600 series.

Phenominal processor!  Phenominal stock cooler!

  I only have one con, and it's not really much of a con, but installation of the cooler could have been a bit easier.  I don't love the bracket design they've got going on, the lever to tighten it feels a bit flimsy even if it isn't really.  I wish they had stuck to the simple four screws method around the CPU.Other than that, this processor is absolutely wonderful, and the stock cooler is very powerful and absolutely silent.For gaming, the highest it has gotten was 70s on Assassin's Creed odyssey maxed settings on 1440p getting 70+ fps.It pairs great with a 1070 ti which is what I'm using for GPUI've got it in a MSI b450 gaming pro carbon AC motherboard which handles it like a dream.Really sweet processor.

  i purchased this CPU back in April and it is a workhorse (MSI Gaming Carbon Pro, MSI 2060 Gaming Z, 32 GB 3200 DDR4)  When the 3000 series came out, I couldn't see spending 300 dollars for only 15% performance increase.  I'll wait until the 4000 series or until the price drops. Would recommend a x570 MB so when the 4000 comes out for easy upgrade.  Make sure you get QVL certified Memory specified in the MB manual.  So buy this awesome processor and use the savings for a better video card and you  can't go wrong.

  Intel killer at this price point.  Absolutely destroys anything I throw at it.  The stock cooler is also great and leagues better than any stock cooler you get with Intel products.  Highly recommend this or any Ryzen CPU for that matter.Side note:  Amazon failed to send out promotional code for ""The Outer Worlds or Borderlands 3"", and their incompetent personnel were either unable to or incapable of resolving the issue.  If you are buying the Ryzen 7 2700x do not expect to get the codes you are entitled to.  From what I can tell this is blatant FALSE ADVERTISING on Amazons part.  They are participating in a promotion and not following through for their customers.

  This is a powerful CPU make sure you get a motherboard with a robust power delivery (as I learned the hard way) as the CPU will draw between 1.4 and 1.5 volts bone stock. This is the chip you get when you are building a ""better than mid-range/budget build"" You'll need a pricier power supply and faster ram, otherwise your not getting the full benefits from the CPU.If your looking for just budget gaming look for the 2400G. Otherwise be ready to spend some more $$ on better hardware.The cooler that comes with this thing is pretty freak'n nice for a stock cooler, and works well in small form-factor builds. It's made by cooler master, and performs as well as one of their stand alone products. I idle around 35c on air (but I did put the fan on the higher setting). The RGB is best controlled though the usb hookup, with the cooler master wraith prism software.

  When re-purposing an old mini-itx I had laying around as linux media PC in the living to be a rose gold glitter bomb gaming rig for my wife's birthday I hit a snag. The connector for the front panel ports had broken a pin, plus it was a bit underpowered to handle much gaming (and NO RGB OMG! lol) so I needed to upgrade it, except the perfectly passable i5 I bought 1 1/2 to 2 years ago apparently is dead to everyone with no decently priced (and literally none at my favorite two vendors) in that form factor. Luckily before I pulled the trigger I realized I could get this and a motherboard for less. Best of all this was such an upgrade that I ended up keeping the 1060 I was going to upgrade since with this chip her primary game looked and played great. Plus the fan is quieter and has RGB which surprisingly looks good in her case and shes actually keeping it on and even playing with the programs where as previously she thought that was for teenage boys playing counter strike lol.

  It was a toss up between this and a Ryzen 5 1800x... I don't regret choosing the 7 2700x instead.  It works great but I've yet to use it for virtualized desktops and development purposes.So far it's been running smooth as silk with my RAM sticks OCed to their rated 3200 Mhz.  Windows launches the smoothest I've seen since my old AMD Athlon x2, I went Intel on my last build...Have yet to OC the actually CPU, though I think it used the profile when the XMP profile was enabled for the RAM.The fan?  The fan isn't rated for OC so it'll be a backup in case the aftermarket cooler dies.

Great CPU

  I currently have built 23 computers with these processors. The installation is really easy and the cooler provided is good enough for the work we do. When I ran a stress test the highest temp I got was 74C. The CPU handles amazingly in gaming and regular work. The price which keeps going on sale is a steal compared to the i7-8700k. Only downside is you have to be careful removing the CPU cooler off the CPU when installed. The Thermal paste used sticks to it like glue so if you don't wiggle it slowly to make them separate you are going to pull both out at the same time possibly damaging the unit.

Well done AMD!  However, in the last 2 weeks from writing this, the ""Prism"" cooler sounds really bad - like it's about to die.  The video attached lets you hear it.

  I recently went team red, and am super happy with the results. I have been using an older Intel chip (4790k) and while it wasn't a slouch by any means, it was still showing its age. I was tied to DDR3 RAM and I do dabble in content creation and gaming/streaming. Trying to run everything all together caused some noticeable slowdowns/stutters. I paired this chip with an Asus ROG STRIX X470 board and 16 GB of DDR4 from Corsair. I do have an AIO cooler that I chose to reuse and as such I left the wraith cooler that was included in the box. It does however appear to be a pretty beefy cooler, and not just a basic fan like you would get with an Intel chip. Pay attention to the orientation of the chip before installation, there should be a gold triangle on the corner that coincides with a mark on the board socket. This seems to be where most new builders accidentally damage a pin and you don't want that. Speed wise I saw an immediate jump in terms of how fast rendering happened, and putting load on the chip was like slicing warm butter. Smooth, easily spreadable and loaded with delicious goodness. Benchmarking showed a definite increase in the multicore score compared to my 4790k which is great. I wish I had saved a screencap of each but that didn't occur to me until after I had done the AMD chip. I haven't dabbled in OC this chip yet, I want to do some research to determine the best route to go but I hear it clocks well and can get some great speeds out of it. Overall I am glad I got this, I could have waited for GEN3 Ryzen but I don't mind. I feel like all the bugs got worked out here.

  This CPU absolutely rocks!  It is blazingly fast. Having built many computers over the years, this CPU impresses me like no other.  I'm using it to run Linux with Windows running in a VM under VirutalBox.  Note: I am not a gamer.The CPU has 16 hyper-threaded cores.  This allows me to allocate 8 cores to the VM and reserve 8 more for Linux.  It's beyond what I need.  My previous system was an Intel Core i5 running at 2.6Ghz.  This new system running the Ryzen has solved all my performance complaints.  Javascript that would run slow on some web sites is no longer an issue.  I can compile the entire Linux kernel in 15 minutes on this system.  It only takes 10 seconds to boot up a Windows VM.  Encryption speeds on my backups are blazing fast.Lastly, AMD actually ships the CPU with a half-way decent fan that doesn't sound like a jet engine taking off.  This is the first time I've built a system where I didn't need an aftermarket CPU fan.  Overall, I am one satisfied customer.

  Upon delivery, no noticeable damage to the larger box holding the 2700X and a few other items. Upon opening the larger box, saw there was no protection at all for any of the items except for a plastic bag around a large bottle. The 2700X box was examined for damage, saw none, but when I broke the seal and opened the cooler's box, found two loose cables placed below the Wraith cooler's heatsink's protective cover. Saw scratches on the thermal pad, the protective cover was all but shredded in the mid-part.  I was hesitant to even open the CPU box for fear it was badly damaged.Checked for bent pins, found none, so i installed the 2700X into a B450 motherboard using a small closed-loop water-cooler instead of the Wraith cooler.  Upgrading from a 2400G, had to switch the HDMI cable from integrated graphics to the discrete graphics card. Powered up the computer, posted right away. No need to update the BIOS or reinstall the OS.Using 16GB of 3200 memory, performed a few stress tests and benchmarks, experienced one lock-up while the auto-overclock was engaged. Backed the memory down to 2933, system became stable.  Still putting it through the paces, so I'm just happy it works at all. Pleased so far with performance, rightfully concerned about the packaging.

This CPU performs great in any task, perfect for gaming
","

   December 30, 2018 (5 days of use):I'm using this processor for gaming, but this is the PC that I use for all what I have to do and I can tell that this processor is made for any task, and it will perform great. Userbenchmark's bench gave me as a result of 100.2% in Base Clock. The AMD Wraith Prism performs great, even in long gaming sessions. I have a poor ventilation on my PC, because I've been armed it by pieces on my own (my next purchase will be some fans), and this Ryzen has never exceeded 85°C after long hours of playing games that demand enough CPU, taking into account that I'm only using a good GPU that generates some heat, that I'm using the stock AMD Wraith Prism Cooler and another intake fan in the front of the case, just that. Also, when I'm only surfing on internet or doing other tasks that demand almost nothing to the processor, the temperature at which it remains after a while is around 40°C - 48°C.AMD Ryzen Master works very well, you can change every aspect of the frecuency of your Ryzen, controll the RAM frecuency and even make some overclock of both, changing values like frecuency of every core, voltage, and even enable the Precision Boost Overdrive, that's a type of automatic overclock, where the CPU takes into account its temperature, maximum frequency and maximum power, to achieve values higher than the 3.7GHz base clock without having to worry about whether the temperature is harmful or if it is exceeding the maximum power or the maximum overclock frequency of the Ryzen. In my opinion, this is a great CPU for every task you need, you will not have only good gaming performace, also a great performance on every day use and in tasks that need a lot of cores and threads.Important for those who want to use the stock Wraith Prism Cooler:Connect ONLY the USB cable from the cooler to the motherboard and not use the RGB cable. Both work, but you will be able to controll RGB only with the USB cable. Also, don't connect both at the same time, because the cooler will only recognize the RGB header and not the USB. Then, download the Cooler Master Wraith Prism RGB Controller app from their website, and then you'll be able to change the color of the halo ring, the fan and the AMD logo, separately.My actual hardware is:-- AMD Ryzen 7 2700X-- Gigabyte Aorus B450 Elite motherboard-- Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 3000MHz (2x8GB)-- AMD Wraith Prism RGB Cooler-- Gigabyte Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB OC G1 Gaming-- MyDigitalSSD SBX 256GB NVMe drive-- Seagate Barracuda 2TB (2016)-- Corsair CX600 ATX Power Supply-- AZZA Blaze 231 RGB case

  I did take off one star for ease of use - as the cooler clamp is a bear and a half to install.  I bought an aftermarket cooler to avoid this (I literally thought I would break my last motherboard while installing the cooler clamp bracket).  AMD has heard complaints about this for years - but has not changed this very hard to install cooler clamp bracket and the fan is too noisy - compared to aftermarket.  That is a shame.  the cooler is great and in my case a waste.  Plan on getting an aftermarket one for ease of use.Other than that it is by far - IMO - the best value out there.Edit:  I don't know why they won't ship it with an aftermarket clamp.  Nice cooler - But darn-it upgrade the clamp and fan and it would be premium and another good reason to buy it.  - But still, I like it and has been very stable!

  Got this during Black Friday 2019 for $160. It was an unbeatable deal. I just looked at the R5 3600 like ""sorry buddy, I want you but lol...they're making it difficult."" I know they usually say the extra 2 cores work well for streaming so I did some twitch streaming @60fps 720p high video bitrate over wifi just to see how it handled it. Had several of my friends tune in including myself from another device. Stream was flawless. Meanwhile the game I was running was Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. 1440p, completely maxed out graphics locked at 60fps. Didn't check the results without a cap while streaming but I know that when I was playing off stream and removed the cap I was getting like 170fps. I paired it up with a Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.  It's a match made in heaven and the RGB of both the CPU and GPU are glorious.I've yet to find any reason to overlcock this CPU. It destroys everything I throw at it. Afterburner shows that the CPU handles itself nicely, boosting up to 4.2Ghz when it needs to, and coming back down to 3.7Ghz. I've never seen it hit 4.3Ghz on its own but like I said, when all your games get FPS like that at stock with those resolutions & graphics settings, what's the point? Emulators get devoured too. Wii U, PS3, Wii/GameCube, PS2 etc, just straight devoured. Breath of the Wild running at 4K@60 like.....""WASSUP?"" Not to mention CEMU 1.17.1 is dropping very soon and we're gonna see an even bigger boost in performance for AMD users. I always see the argument about ""get the R7 2700X over the R5 3600 only if you stream"". No bro, just get it cuz it's cheaper, has more cores, and has a monster heatsink. The gaming performance you're gonna lose is extremely negligent. Check out the testers on youtube.Speaking of heatsink, almost forgot the temps. I use a NZXT H510 with only the default exhaust fan setup. No extra case fans. I just tweaked the fan curves of the case, cpu and gpu slightly to my liking. Not enough for noise to be an issue either. I live in the Caribbean, it's dry season at the moment, so it's hot as hell. No AC in my room. My temps never go above 70c while gaming....so it's pretty safe to say the heatsink is doing its job. I was expecting more heat with a cramped case like mine and that monster AMD gpu (you know AMD looooves some toast action), but everything's actually running cool. This CPU/Heatsink combo man, there's just so much to love and so much money to save. Gotta love it lol.

  I paired this Processor with an MSI X470 Gaming Plus MB, 16GB of DDR4 3000 Team Force Memory, a Nemix 512MB SSD & a Sapphire RX580 8GB Video Card. Power is supplied by a ThermalTake 750 Watt Power Supply. This was an upgrade from my 10 year old Intel Core 2 Duo 3.0ghz processor & 8GB of DDR2 Memory. The system is running Windows 10 Pro. The installation & instructions were straight forward. On the initial setup, I briefly had the the CPU running at 4.4Ghz. The system was stable, with no problems. The only concern I had was running at this speed (using the Stock Ryzen 2700X CPU Cooler set to High) the CPU temps were too high for my liking. So I reset my CPU speed back to stock (3.7Ghz) & the CPU temps are back where they should be. Take Note: If your going to Overclock this CPU, I recommend using a better quality cooler or you would risk damage to your CPU. As far as speed/quickness compared to my old system, hands down this new build is lighting fast. I hope I have many years of good service with the CPU/Motherboard Combo. Take Note: My 1st attempt using the same components (CPU & Motherboard), I had to RMA back to Amazon. Symptoms: Failed POST. No power - Nothing. Contacted Amazon & they made the RMA Process very smooth. They replaced both the CPU & the MSI Motherboard with no questions asked & no cost to me. Once I had the new components in hand, I proceeded a 2nd time. As previously mentioned, I encountered no issues. I was able to pick up the AMD 2700X at $265 & the MSI Gaming Plus MB at $90. Quite a bargain compared to Intel's Offerings. Bottom Line: Equal/Superior Overall Performance without spending twice the cost. Watch Out Intel, AMD will be eating your lunch. Anyone considering this processor should give this processor a Serious Consideration before spending more money on Intel's Offerings.

  As I purchase this  on sale, it is an incredible value in computer technology. For my new build, I decided to give AMD the nod, and went with this processor. (I have not built with AMD since the Athlon X2 6000 Windsor core.). This CPU handily outperforms my OCd i7-5930K on the X99 platform, and that is no slouch, for a lot less money. I am running this on an ASUS Crosshair VI Extreme X370 Motherboard, and I am not noticing any thing missing from X470. My overclock and RAM compatibility are fine.While this is truly a great CPU, (and I look forward to Matisse), this is not a great overclocker CPU. You can get some extra frequency out of it with superior water cooling and some luck with the silicon lottery, but do not expect much over 4.3 Ghz. Of course, I did not buy this  CPU for the overclocking potential. I am running 4.1 Ghz on all cores with air cooling, and am quite satisfied. Your own results may vary. This CPU will be used for both Content creation and for gaming. Very glad I went with this CPU.

  I managed to snag this bad boy up on Black Friday, and got it for around $100 less than the normal price. Even at its standard price, this is still an excellent CPU for gaming, media creation, and workstations. Even with the stock cooler, there is a little bit of room for overclocking, though the performance is more than adequate at stock clock speeds. The fact that the included cooler is RGB is awesome. The fan looks amazing in the case.About the ONLY negative I can think of is that the cooler is a bit loud at idle. That said, when the fan speed ramps up, it doesn't get much louder. It's not annoyingly loud or anything... but, in a quiet room, you'll notice it.AMD knocked it out of the park with this CPU. Many will argue that the 2600X is better for gaming, due to its higher clock speed... but, considering that the clock speed of this CPU isn't much lower (and can easily be OC'ed to compensate for that small margin), and more games are being optimized for multi-core CPU's, I see no reason to choose a 2600 over a 2700. Especially considering the relatively small price difference.

Going from """"""eight cores""""""*** To actual eight cores with SMT is night and day.In addition, the included Wraith Prism cooler is a great inclusion. It has ARGB, and will keep your CPU reasonably cool. I ended up replacing mine with a be quiet! Dark Rock Slim, but you really don't need to upgrade if you don't want to. This is a big step up from my 8350, which would overheat if my room got even slightly warm.Overall, this CPU is a great buy. However, if you're more focused on gaming over multitasking, I recommend the Ryzen 5 3600X over this. The 3rd gen. Ryzen CPUs have better frequencies and IPCs, making them faster in general. This is still a good option nonetheless.

Another happy AMD customer..

  My i7 4790k board died and I really wanted to support AMD in their return to the competition!  I'm very happy with this cpu.  I'm running this on the Asus Crosshair 7 Hero with 32gigs of G-Skill Trident Z F4-3200C16D-32GTZRX.There was a small learning curve to overclock it but I got it running at 4.25ghz on all cores at 1.3875v and running 32gb RAM at 3400mhz.  Cooling is a Corsair H150i RGB.  I am 100% stable with Aida64, Prime95 with small FFT's on, Cinabench and 3dMark.  Temps barely touch 80c in Prime95 small FFT's.  I used the OC preset number 3 (forgot the name of the setting but there are many guides onlineEverything runs very snappy with normal desktop work.  Games are much better than with the 4790k!  I can run everything I have tried at nearly maxed out everything.  This is obviously not on the level of some of the Intel offerings that can clock much higher.  The beauty is that the X470 motherboards should support the new 3700X with a BIOS update so the upgrade path is easy and coming soon!

  I love it I switch from an Intel 6700k I didn’t wipe my os  however but it seemed to work fine after a few updates the hiccups are mostly gone. Luckily I turned my license digital so I reactivated windows. I purchased this with the asus strix 470 f mobo. Seems to be a power house. Whatever I may have lost in gaming compared to intel I’ve gained plenty on multitasking. It’s like nothing phases this cpu.

Amazing performance, the fan is quiet and the cooler master software is better than Asus Aura.
","

  As you can see, I eventually got an AIO for my CPU. I used the stock cooler for 2 weeks my idle Temps were 45 C and it got in the upper 70s under a load. I used Asus aura sync with the stock cooler, then I moved the cooler in my old PC, my FX-8320 is much cooler and I'm using cooler master's software, I like it more than Asus aura, it has 3 lighting zones the AMD logo, the rings, and the fan. The Ryzen 7 2700x gets up to 65% usage when playing Anthem (Ray-tracing enabled on GPU). I get amazing performance, watch out for TeamViewer if you have it, it used up 65% of my CPU! I don't know how it did that, but I knew it when I reached 100% CPU usage in Anthem. Overall, there are people who say AMD sucks, I'm an AMD fan and it's a good time to be an AMD fan. Their Ryzen CPUs are amazing and way cheaper than Intel. I hope they come up with Ray-tracing for their GPUs that would be a game changer. Seriously if you demand performance a powerful CPU at a low price, look no further than AMD!Update:I used the stock cooler on my AMD FX-8320 and the thermals are unbelievable, I'm still a little skeptical. According to all temperature apps my FX-8320 running at 100% usage 3.7 Ghz reached a max of 36 degrees Celsius. I was playing Assassin's Creed odyssey for 6 hours it was paused for 2 hours, but it still put a load on the CPU. I called AMD to see if my CPU might have a bad temperature sensor, they said it's fine. I guess I'll see, I touched the heatsink to see if it was hot, it was mildly warm. If it really is rimming at 36 degrees Celsius, then this is an amazing cooler.

Amazing CPU at its original price, but an unbelievable performance bargain now!
","

  In the old days, people bought Intel CPUs if they could afford them, and AMD was an also-ran you would buy only if you didn't have the cash for Intel.  Boy have the tables turned with Ryzen CPUs.  They are now faster, more reliable, and cheaper than Intel for comparable performance.  If you are hesitant to buy AMD because you always believed Intel is better, try a Ryzen - you won't regret it.This specific CPU is 2 years old now.  I bought it when it was new and paid $320 on Amazon for it.  Now it's $220 because there are newer CPUs.  If you can afford the $300-$400 price range there are faster (newer) Ryzens I would buy, but if you are on a budget you will NOT be disappointed with this chip. I use it in my Plex Media Server and even with 4 clients streaming 1080P video (3 of them transcoding video and audio on the fly) plus 2 shows recording on its DVR, this CPU rarely breaks 50% utilization.  Though it was designed as a desktop CPU, it actually makes a great server CPU because of its stability, which is further improved because it supports ECC RAM.  In 2 years of usage, it has never crashed.  My uptimes are measured in months, with restarts only when an OS update requires it.  Highly recommend AMD and Ryzen, will definitely buy again.

Seems powerful
","

  First time building my own PC and used the Ryzen 7 2700X.  It was very simple to install into the MOBO, just have to be careful to only touch the edges, not the bottom or top.  The cooler was a little more difficult to install only because I thought I would break it.  There is a latch on the cooler that attaches to the MOBO and you have to apply quite a bit of force for it to snap down.  Don't worry tho, you won't break anything.So far it handles Subnautica, Fallout 4, X plane 11, Wreckfest and a slew of other games very well.The temp hasn't spiked over 63 C even with just the stock cooler.  Well worth the money compared to intel, which was more expensive and didn't have a cooler.  I also read these are going to be forward+backward compatible which is a huge plus for when you'd need to upgrade in the future.  I don't believe intel has that capability.

  Needed to upgrade,  gave my i7 4770k pc to my kids and used this for a living room htpc. Great for games movies and basic computing's. At 150 dollars I am very very happy. AMD is about to release 3rd gen so prices might drop slightly in 5 months but at thos price why wait.Updated 2 months later, great with games however trash with video converting,  PC crashes everytime, just a blank screen while pc runs. I turned the power Management fir the cpu to 60% instead of 100 and no more crashes. This is with an upgraded fan with a corsair case so the air flow is on point and after market fan but this will not work at full strength. I am very disappointed there and now should've bout the 3rd gen ryzen. Everything else is flawless running 100% power but if you video convert stay away. The i7 4770k which is 5 years old does video converting so not sure what the deal here is.

Good Value But Not For Gaming
","

  Lots of reviewers here don’t really understand how important cores and clock speed are or aren’t. More isn’t necessarily better. For a gaming pc, you’re  better off going with a Ryzen 5 2600 or the new 5 3600. This eight core cpu will only benefit you for productivity, or other applications outside of gaming that will utilize the extra cores.With that said, Ryzen still is behind Intel in clock speeds and overclock headroom so if you have to have the best for gaming, don’t buy into the AMD hype. Intel is still king for high FPS high refresh rate gaming.

A great chip with a decent cooler and an unmatched upgrade potential
","

  This chip successfully blends gaming performance with streaming/multicore workload performance for a lot less than the  competing 9900k. If you are just going to game, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you are a streamer/content creator who also wants to snag some pretty cool frames in games, this is for you.With many games, the cpu usage rarely goes above 50%, and even while running obs at the same time it keeps on rolling. The only game I have had a problem with is GTA V, of all games. When loading, the game takes all the cores that it can get, despite being over 5 years old. Once loaded in, its better, though  it still takes up a lot more cpu than makes sense. In RS2 Vietnam, for example, the cpu is rarely utilized to more than 30%, even with discord, chrome, and a bunch of other processes going. This makes me think GTA is an anomaly.The stock fan is loud, but effective. It also has RGB. It is good enough to run as a permanent solution, and even overclock with. However, it has this stupid clippy thing to attach  it to the mobo and it's kind of annoying.As for upgrading, this chipset is supposedly going to be supported for 2 more years, so it is likely you will be abler to swap chips in and out in the future without also swapping motherboards and effectively rebuilding your pc.All in all , 4.5 stars.

Runs a little hot, but a great CPU for the current price
","

  When I saw these go on sale for 160 I had to pick one up and get a new build going. My previous PC had an AMD FX 6300, so upgrading from that to this Ryzen 7 is pretty amazing.The 6300 could handle most of what I wanted to do, but this Ryzen handles it with ease and does more. Constant 60fps with 1440p and some games in 4k with good framerates paired with the RX 580, and down the line I plan to upgrade GPUs to get better performance since I'm sure it can do better. Nearly instant boot times when paired with an M.2 NVMe drive, and most processes are a breeze.The Wraith spire was very easy to install on the ASUS Strix B450-F since it went directly on the brackets that were already on the motherboard (which was great since the coolers I've installed in the past have been a pain in comparison), looks pretty with the LEDs and runs relatively well from what I can gather.My only concern is the temps on this CPU, and to my understanding the main difference with X models is that they come overclocked, and I imagine that's why the temps are high. Of course, the 6300 with an aftermarket cooler rarely went over 100°F and that's the CPU I've had for a while, so I was a bit surprised to see the temps show up at 130-140°F while idling. According to some posts I've seen this is the normal for the 2700X, and it does make sense since it is more powerful and comes overclocked in comparison to the CPUs I've had more experience with.Thankfully even though it does run hot it doesn't get much hotter, my temps haven't really gone over 155°F while gaming or performing tasks, and the max is about 185°F. The usage percent hasn't gone above 40 for most of my regular gaming and tasks either, which is impressive.It's a great CPU to get, especially while it's on sale for around $160.

This CPU is a workhorse
","

  With eight cores and multithreading, you'll have no shortage of CPU for your average productivity and videogame needs. The stock cooler on this thing puts every other stock cooler to shame. The cooler is easily worth 35-50 dollars on it's own, featuring RGB lighting, and cooling that ACTUALLY WORKS. You'll be getting temps of 35 up to 70 celsius. That's amazing for being a stock cooler. I didn't even buy a real cooler for it because of how good the stock is. If you're going to be doing some moderate to high overclocking, you will want a better cooler though. It's unfortunate this cooler uses that *HORRIBLE* latch system. Also a bit unfortunate because of infinity fabric, ram speeds appear halved.

Beast CPU

  After trying 3 different coolers on this thing, it seems to run very hot. However after obsessing about my temps for so long, I decided to ignore them. I'm still playing at 1080p and this cpu is more than enough for that. The CPU doers run noticeable hotter than Intel. This doesn't bother me anymore though and for the price, you are getting a really good processor and it allows you to spend more money on a GPU. I gave 4 starts to stability, because this is the x version.  It constantly jumps in temps and usage. I get a sawtooth temperature graph. Even when my PC is idling, the CPU is going nuts sometimes. It's only annoying if you pay attention to it though. I have never had a problem in gaming or any other tasks.

I take a look and check the chip and see it has a few bent pins. I then email AMD support to see if the warranty might cover it and it takes literally 2 weeks before AMD support tells me that the warranty will not cover it and tell me to go to a local hardware store to fix it. 2 WEEKS and I still have not gotten my computer setup.

  I've enjoyed this CPU for about half a year.It's been a great value and has done fantastic for both games and content creation.Even with the release of the 3000 series Ryzen this chip should be considered.If you are a gamer only this is not the chip for you as you can get a 3600x for just a little bit more money and get better gaming out of it.This chip is now best suited for those who want to do content creation on a budget although it still does gaming very well. You will not find a better CPU near this price point for content creation and multi use purposes. Very likely the best total value you can get at time of this review.If you only want budget content creation the 2700 non x variant maybe the way to go. Although the 2700x is the better total value.If you have lots of money just look at the 3000 series instead.

  I've been an ""intel"" guy my entire life. So when one of my friends recommended this as a close bang for your buck option for gaming I thought he was nuts at first. But it turns out he's absolutely correct. Before my last pc fried I was used to intel and was running an Intel core i5 4570. I think I paid $189 for this on sale? Anyways this thing over clock's based on tempurature so when you use sufficient cooling it's just nuts. With my new setup it rarely gets anywhere over 45 Celsius (running it with an Asus rog b-450f motherboard and rtx 2070 super) when you compare this to the Intel option which I belive was around $500 AND it does not come with a cooler included (which this does) you can't beat it. Save yourself 400 dollars in the long run and accept the general 4 to 9 percent of performance lost tested on many games.

  What's to say that hasn't already been said.The second generation of Ryzen is amazing. When the 2700x first came out it wasn't super worth it. Even now, for gaming performance the third generation Ryzen 5 3600 is slightly better even with less cores, the 2700x has a bit more versatility for streaming and video editing.The stock cooler is made by Cooler Master and is great for base performance. I wouldn't recommend overclocking with it outside of maybe a smaller boosts. It looks great although to note, you need to hook up both cables to fully control the RGB on it.It's one of the quietest stock coolers I've ever owned. Not saying it's noise free but it's almost inaudible in my NZXT 500i.All in all, it's an amazing CPU, I would highly recommend it to almost anyone. I think it would best pair with a RTX 2060 for 1080p at 60 FPS or RTX 2070 super for 1440p at over 100 FPS in most titles.

  This CPU is unarguably great, but the cooler that comes with it is not so good.  As you can see in the picture I am accompanying, the bottom of the cooler which makes contacts with the face of the CPU is not entirely flat.  There are grooves between heat pipes.  If this cooler was to be a decent one, there won't be any such grooves between the heat pipes at the bottom.  The bottom is to be entirely flat.  Thermal compound comes between the cooler and the face of the CPU, but the compound is not designed to fill these giant gaps.  And, also movement of the cooler will also add to the problem.  the latching mechanism of this cooler doesn't securely fix the cooler and allows movements of the cooler in relation to the CPU.  If AMD is willing to send me a decent CPU cooler for free, I will gladly accept it.

  I was an AMD fan back in the begining of the millenium and then they had poor preformance for a while. I recently built my sone a gaming computer with a Ryzen 5 1500X and it has been great. Its a great chip that has been preforming at a phenominal rate, especially for the price. I needed to build a new PC for video creation/editing and some light gaming. So, I went with the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X because of the great performance of my sons Ryzen 5 and the price point. This chip is a BEAST!!! I have significantly shortened my video rendering times and it doesnt flinch at the task. I havent messed around with overclocking yet and I am not sure I will have to for what I need it for. This chip is significantly up to the tasks I have in store for it. The price is cheaper than the Intel i7 8700K and I believe it benchmarks higher for multi-core processing in comparison. The one thing I will say about the AMD Ryzen CPU's is they are finicky about working with different RAM modules and rely on them heavily for computing. So ensure that you research the MOBO QVL abd CPU QVL to get the correct memory. I am definitely TEAM AMD!!!

Update: Figured out my issue, deleting my issue and rewriting what was up
","


  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   This cpu is great, upgraded from the Ryzen 5 1500x.  Installation was smooth and seamless. Read the description of this product and make sure your bios is flashed unless you know you'll be able to boot straight up. There's software to customize the lights but make sure you only install the usb cable to it and your motherboard. If you install both or the rgb cable you won't be able to customize. The lights are just an added bonus but overall it's great. Also be sure you have your retention hooks that came with your board as this uses retention clips.*UPDATE*I figured out the problem was that the minimum processor state was set to 90%. That's an issue because that's what helps control the amperage going through the cpu. The software that is for the 2000 series cpus showed that my edc was always at 90%. This meant because the minimum was set to 90%, the cpu amperage would never fall below critical. So playing a cpu intensive game will cause the amperage to exceed what the cpu is rated for. This is what killed it the first time (and had probably killed my gpu along with it because it never booted with the 1500x after that, plus i fried it, lol whoops.) I had set the minimum down to 1%, and this helped a lot but when I stress tested the cpu and the edc would hit critical and even hit 100%. So i had to turn off core boost and this kept my edc at safe levels. Might have just been me but when getting this processor, go through the checks I did. I have it OC to 3.9 and may boost it later but for right now it works flawlessly. Download the Ryzen Master software for this cpu and keep an eye on the edc. This processor will be turbo'd even at idle (it will stay at 4.1 until you start playing a game). If you notice the edc wont drop below 90%, I'll rehash my steps:Open up control panelGo to hardwarego to power options and hit choose power planMake sure you have AMD Ryzen Balanced selected and then click change plan settingsGo to advanced settingsGo to processor power management then drop down minimum processor state, and type 1%If your edc is still too high for your comfort, restart your system and go into your bios and turn off core boost. Everything should be fine then. You will lose the edc reading but dont worry, your cpu will be fine. OC as you wish. Just be mindful when doing so. Hope this helps, I don't want others to have their systems get ruined like mine did and have to buy new hardware like i did. This is a fantastic processor, there is just a hiccup to fix and luckily it's easy to do.

  I have nothing but good things to say about this product, but be aware that you must get this chip seated properly on your board. I made this mistake and spent the better part of a day trying to figure out the issue. Non-the-less, it was user error and so it goes. Can't happier with the value I get out of AMD for my business machine builds. IMPORTANT NOTE: Be aware that this CPU does NOT have an onboard graphics processor. That means that you will have to install a graphics card in order for your computer to work. I recommend a graphics card for any and all users including business software users. Much of software today is actually more graphics intense and a decent graphics card will help you drive multiple monitors for more efficiency and helps ""smooth"" out applications, decrease load times, increase overall productivity and it's plain old better to have dedicated devices.

  So before I used to have an intel 4690k. Yes I know its an old CPU, but when I upgraded to this Chip....MY GOD! It felt so good to be able to play VR, have my streaming software running and live, having chat windows open, task manager, and an oculus mirror program so my stream could see my perspective. My Old CPU would be around 99% usage, but now my 2700x runs around like 25-30% usage. Like my god! I love how free I feel with this east in my rig. Now I can swirl my tap water and feel fancy as I enjoy a good ol gaming session.I really recommend this product for anyone who is an intel fan, because its just as much bang as an i7 8700k, but at such an affordable price that this budget bucks me good.All jokes aside, this really does improve my performance a shit ton! Especially because I can now take full advantage of my gtx 1060 6gb finally. I have 16g DDR4 3600mghz Trident z ram. I got this CPU while I upgraded my mobo, ram, and cpu (duh).

Excellent CPU, well worth the $$
","

  If you're looking for your first CPU (as I was in my first personal build) and want something that has excellent performance without dropping $500 on a CPU then the Ryzen 7 2700X is a great choice. This CPU does everything I need it to and more, and performs nicely with the mobo/RAM I bought with it (Ripjaws V 32GB 3000Mhz / MSI X470 CARBON PRO mobo). I had absolutely no issues with installation and at least with my setup I'm getting 4.0GHz out of the box without any tweaking at all which is excellent.In the end definitely worth the investment and a great product.

5 stars for the CPU, 4 for the cooler
","

  There are a lot of complaints that the Wraith Prism cooler is loud. In my experience it's not so much that it's *loud* as that it's very obvious when it changes speed. And unfortunately, with default BIOS and Windows settings, it's going to change speed a lot--BIOS will generally make your fans react immediately to small temperature changes, and under the Balanced or AMD Balanced Window power plans, the OS will constantly cycle the processor frequency up and down at idle, which leads to regular temperature fluctuations, which leads to regular fan speed fluctuations (about one cycle every 10 seconds).My solution was 1) to set the ""step up time"" and ""step down time"" BIOS fan settings to the maximum values MSI would allow, and 2) to configure my fan curve to maintain a constant 40% until 60C (it only gets that hot under heavyish load), and then ramp steadily toward 100% at 80C. Those two things together keep it unnoticeable most of the time.

  When I decided to build a new video machine, I was discussing with a colleague about how to spec it.  He suggested I buy as much processor as I could and add RAM later.  So I went with the 2700x over the 2600x.It's beautiful.  The RGB cooler looks great.  In a high airflow, fan cooled case using the stock OC software, it's cool and stable.  I can't say anything negative about this unit at all.If I had it to do over again, I'd have gone with the 2600x and 64GB RAM out of the gate, because my software doesn't even come close to using all the processor, but 32GB RAM isn't enough.

2700x is very well-rounded
","

  What I've always loved about Ryzen CPUs is their value compared to Intel. AMD is comparable to the 8700k (~$360), and some even consider it to be on par with the 9700k (~$420 on Amazon). Upgrading from a 1600 (on one computer) and 2600x (on another) is a breeze. Why? AM4 compatibility, which is something Intel decides not to do. Want to upgrade to Ryzen 2 (TBA at CES)? Just take off your cooler, take your current CPU out, and put this new one in WITHOUT the hassle of dropping another $190-$290 on a new motherboard. The 2700x even comes with a cooler, which the 9700k does not have, and a fine cooler at that. An aesthetically pleasing cooler and fully functional one that keeps one of my 2700x under 73C  with Precision Boost 3 (which goes up to 5Ghz for me). My other 2700x is AIO water cooled, and can push out up to 6.5Ghz (on all cores) with Precision Boost 2 at 70C-80C.This CPU at idle gives out 2% usage, which I took for granted until I looked at an i5 8400(?) which idled at 20%. Also, Ryzen Master, beautiful work of art. Instead of restarting my computer a million times to get a stable clock, I can just go into Ryzen Master, increase core clocks until it crashes, then raise the voltage and find a stable clock speed. Or you can leave it to Precision Boost 2, but I like to run my CPU at 4.2 Base with Precision Boost 2 enabled.If you're doing a mid-tier budget build for all-purpose, I really suggest this CPU, as it can do everything equally well, as it is more around daily tasks than Intel's gaming tasks. I love this CPU so much, that I've fitted it in all four of the computers in the house with no complaints on gaming or such from others.Edit:Added photos of stock 2700x cooler. Fan colour changes and the ring around the fan has an RGB wave pattern. It can maintain a semi-idle 2700x at 35C-45C. Also uploaded some photos of it. Haven’t touched the software though and I personally don’t plan to.Edit 2: Just got my 9900k, and it was a massive disappointment compared to this $310 Ryzen beast. In CS:GO, a CPU intensive game, it only ran 20FPS faster, which literally doesn’t matter since most monitors can’t go over 240HZ (2700x had 275 avg; 9900k has 300; but these CPUs max out at 500 in certain scenarios). My 9900k was even clocked at 5.3Ghz and costs $530, so compared to this Ryzen 2700x, it really isn’t worth it unless you want to show it off or do Adobe stuff which is optimised for Intel. But because I overclocked, my temps were 30C idle and up to 90C during gaming. On the 2700x, it never broke 60C, with the same cooler and fans.Pros-cost effective-comes with a decent stock cooler-easy overclock (if you like that sort of thing)-easy to upgrade from Zen 1 or upgrade to Ryzen 2-cheaper motherboards that can easily overclockCons-not the best single-core performance, but what do you expect for $310 compared to Intel's $380 CPU-not the best variety of motherboards (which isn't a 2700x problem, but just general)-I can't think of anything else

Ryzen 2700 X, Super Duper for everything
","

  Its easy to install.It is super powerful in single core applications.It is super powerful in multi-core applications.It comes with a Prism air cooler with a simple bracket, and already has pre-applied thermal paste.The only downside is that I already am looking at better fan and cooling options, as this is a hot running chip (like most all of them these days) but the temp can spike very quickly under load.  The Prism air cooler that comes with it should be fine, but if you are doing any kind of overclooking of anything in your case, or live in a hot environment - I would recommend an upgrade to the stock air cooler it comes with.  it is nice looking, super easy to install, but is pretty much at the limit of being able to perform.They have been successfully sold to others that have different AMD chips that aren't as robust or have lower cooling needs to folks on Ebay or in the classifieds.At this price, the AMD guys are hitting out of the park with this super fast, reliable, and overclockable chips having intel sweating a bit I'm sure.Highly recommend.

Nice upgrade over a Ryzen 5.
","

  Bought this as an upgrade over an old Ryzen 51600x. It's currently paired with a Gigabyte AB350 Gaming 3, 16 GB RAM and an ASUS RTX 2070 Black. I realize the MoBo and chipset don't seem to bring out the best in it, but it still outperforms my old CPU so I'm fine with it. It comes with a neat programmable LED fan that requires AMD's software for it. I didn't bother with it, looks fine as it is. Worthy of notice is the fact that the 1600x was bottlenecking the 2070, which is why I bought this. The 2700x is currently on factory settings and idles around 40° C and goes up to about 67° C when gaming, though my case does have quite a few fans so I suppose that helps.Performance in games at 1080p (I play a couple MMOs and racing games and such):Need For Speed Heat.At Max settings I get about 35 fps when driving through busier areas. High settings it sits perfectly at 60 fps.World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth:Max settings most world areas in the newest expac run at 60 fps. Main cities at around 35-40 fps. Battlegrounds/battleground raids will go down to about 25 fps but it's to be expected.Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers:Max settings in most areas run fine at 60 fps. Busier main cities will go down to 45 fps. Raids will usually hover between 50-60 fps.Overwatch:Max settings: 60 fps all around.

  When Ryzen first released, I bought the 1600x to replace my Intel, it was much better than my Intel (I had an older i5 that was OC'ed to the max). One of my friends told me about the price drop on the 2700X so I decided to jump on it, I am so glad I did. I can't believe the performance gains over my 1600X. If anyone is looking to build a gaming PC for medium dollars, I would highly recommend this processor and the Gigabyte Aorus X470. My benchmarks with this MB and processor W/O any OC is a lot faster than my 1600X, even in single core benchmarks (which is the only place my 1600X didn't do great). I can't comment on longevity yet, but I am very, very happy with what I have here.

  Haven't tried gaming, but for desktop and workstation (Affinity, Davinci Resolve, Cakewalk) it's been great!UserBenchmark has me at 109% for Desktop and 98% for Workstation. An i9-9900K, at over twice the price, is considered the reference at 100% and 100%.Cons? 105W TDP seems a little excessive. But the i9 isn't much better, at 95W. And power supplies, cooling, and case designs are sooo much better than they used to be.Also, the included boxed fan seems quite nice, vs the oem Intel I'm used to. Could do without the light show though. My kiddo suggests I should hook up the supplied cable to the RGB controller on the mobo, which should allow me to turn off the lighting!

Great for gaming and content creation.
","

  After using this CPU for several months, I finally have a final opinion.For gaming:I have this CPU paired with an RTX 2060 SUPER 8gb and I don't get any noticeable CPU bottlenecks at 1080 144Hz.It is installed in an Asrock B450M Steel Legend motherboard and I use the stock Wraith Prism cooler on it. Never once, have I thermal throttled. According to 3dMark I get a single core boost of 4.5Ghz but when I'm at the desktop it hovers around 4.00Ghz. While gaming I usually have Discord, Opera with Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and some other tab open along with Steam, Epic Games and of course the game i'm running and it handles all these tasks while not sacrificing any gaming performance. Overall Gaming experience (1080p): 10/10Content Creation:When I first got this CPU I used OpenShot video editor which could not take advantage of GPU acceleration so the 16 threads on this CPU were extremely useful. We're talking less than an hour for 20 minute 4k videos to be rendered at high bit-rates. (Mileage may very based on your ambient temps and motherboards VRM capabilities) Overall Content Creation Score: 7/10 (Might want a threadripper for anything professional)Included Wraith Prism Cooler: As good as you would expect form any $40 cooler, extremely efficient and should work the same for everybody. Might be able to handle light overclocking if you win the silicon lottery. And for the RGB, it's fantastic. The cooler master wraith prism software works great and doesn't need to be running for the RGB profiles to stick.Value for money: It's great if you can get it for under $200. I paid $240 and I'm more than happy.

  Do not purchase this thinking you're going to overclock it. It's honestly pointless for the trouble you will go through for less than 8+ fps at least gaming wise. I could not get anything stable at 4.3ghz under 1.4v, so I was stuck at 4.2, and when it was overclocked my cores we're still fluctuating between 2200 to 4200 on ryzen master, I cannot figure out why that is. I returned everything to stock and now under boost it hit 4.3 GHz but voltage peaked at 1.5v and crashed on division 2. I have owned it for 1 day and have had nothing but a headache so far, kind of regret not going the Intel route, I returned this cpu as well as the x470 rog strix f gaming mobo, not worth the headache and dislike rog bios , instead opting for a 2700 and an msi board and possibly not liking that either and just go for Intel.

  For half the price of the Ryzen 7 3xxx series cpu, its VERY hard to argue that this cpu is not an absolute steal for $165 (at time of review). While gaming in heavy cpu games (Battlefield V is my main game currently), cpu stays ridiculously cool under load with provided PRISM cooler, sitting at 64C after hours of gaming and maintaining allcore turbo of 4.3GHz. I also do coding for game development ad this cpu chomps through thousands of lines of code in no time without breaking a sweat.

  Strong performance for a superior value.  To be clear, there are certainly faster CPUs out there, but unless you are doing some extensive 4K/8k video editing there are few situations where a CPU at 3 to 5 times the cost will make a notable difference.While not top of the line, the Ryzen 7 2700x is a very strong cpu and won’t disappoint for about 98% of the tasks this CPU will be asked to do (even performance gaming).  If you’re building on a budget spend those extra dollars on M.2 storage (huge improvement), fast DDR4 memory, and the best GPU you can afford. The led cpu cooler is a nice feature that’s satisfying to look.

  Great product.  New PC build runs like a dream.  I'm not a gamer.  I just don't want to deal with manufacturer garbage programs on my PC.  One thing I would recommend is to buy your own thermal compound.  Clean all the manufacturer's compound off the fan and put your own ""pea sized drop"" in the middle.  My first one, I used it exactly as it came from AMD.  With the thermal compound all over the square, as I maneuvered the fan unit, the compound oozed off the sides and messed up the install.

  This is my first purchase of an AMD processor that was not an FX model. And the FX was a fairly decent processor. Now I was skeptical about switching from Intel(my last build) to an AMD due to how hard it was to cool that FX. However, I bit the bullet and made the buy. Coupled with the EVGA 240 CLC, the highest temp I got was 60C. That was throwing 3 benchmarks at it(Cinebench, ASUS Furmark CPU burner, and Nova bench). Now the downside is that EVGA's CLC software CAN NOT READ AMD RYZEN PROCESSORS ACCURATELY.I got temps in the 80's, 90's, and even 100's on the EVGA flow control, even with the coolant temp reading 22C. So Beware these false temps in third party software. I trust CPUID and the MOBO's BIOS.

I'd recommend the Ryzen 7 2700 over this if it's on sale or the Ryzen 5 2600(x) if you want to spend a $100+ less and don't mind overclocking/having two fewer cores.AMD has made a very strong comeback and they aren't cutting corners like Intel by not including a stock cooler (or including garbage coolers), making the PCB thinner, and using thermal paste instead of solder for the IHS.

Nice, solid processor
","

  Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this processor.  It's great performance for the money.  Probably my only real complaint would be that the RGB on the Wraith Prism cooler isn't completely addressable without using the Corsair connector and software.  For my situation, this was not a real issue since my system is water cooled, but I can imagine it being an annoyance for anyone wanting to air cool, unless they are already using corsair's software.

  I was wanting to get a gaming and 3d design computer setup on the cheap.  My younger brother has a slick gaming rig but has a couple thousand easily invested and I don't game enough to justify that much money and I really needed a quick work computer for doing my Fusion 360 stuff.  This thing fit the bill perfectly as it came with the better cooler, xbox game pass and another free game on top of that.  Now I've got a capable computer with mostly new parts (used GPU for $70) and for less than $600, I'm set.  Thanks AMD!

If you are going from a 6 or earlier Intel or fx cpu then its a worthy upgrade and affordable vrs Intel, but if you are in the 7gen Intel keep what you got and save your money till either manufacture comes out with something that is a major improvement.  I am hoping then when Ryzen 3 comes out there will be a major improvement, If not then as much as I do not like the Intel monopoly  I will be going back blue.

  Haven't had an AMD processor since the Athlon X2 series on the 939 socket.  This was used to replace an Intel i5-4670K system.  As well as consolidate two computers into one.  BIG BIG difference!  The new 2700X system is a dual purpose Python development/gaming system.  The extra cores are a night and day difference for the former.  This thing can run a Linux VM crunching data and storing that within a local database and play a game at the same time while I wait!  If you need the extra threads just grab this CPU and spend the extra money saved on more RAM or a better GPU.

Blown away with the thrilling performance and stability of this processor

  I built my first PC in 2002 with AMD processor and ATI graphics card and then I moved to Intel until now. I was skeptical of AMD Ryzen at first and hesitated several times buying this CPU. I even cancelled my order of my CPU and motherboard. I ordered Intel CPU and motherboard and then cancelled the orders and order AMD Ryzen again. But my decision was right. The performance is similar to Intel. While gaming would have been a little bit better with intel, the consistent performance of ryzen is impressive. It is able to keep up with intel CPUs and will too in the coming years.I was worried about the quality of motherboard of Ryzen, but damn the x470 motherboards are packed with features and even better than most intel z370 motherboard and on par with new intel z390 boards. I will hopefully upgrade to 3rd gen zen2 processor next years with the latest motherboards.I could not even think of buying AMD products in the past let it be desktop or laptops. Intel was the only option but my perception have completely changed and people deciding to get into this platform should not hesitate either.

  I'm running this AMD Ryzen 7 2700X under Linux Mint 19 as a general workstation. I paired it with an EVGA RTX 2080 GPU, 64G of RAM, and SSDs. These aren't the absolute fastest parts, but the price came in about $300 less than a build with an Intel chipset for comparable performance. Typical workloads include lots of compilation (gcc), Blender, VirtualBox VMs, docker, Lightworks video editing, and other development tasks. Under moderate load the fans tick up, but it runs cooler than the box it replaces though it's easily twice as fast.I don't play games on this, but it can render a moderately complex Blender 3D scene in about 45 minutes.

Great PROC

  This is a great PROC for your money and the cooler is good.  A little loud for my taste though.  Also, if you want to control all of the colors on both the fan and the ring, you will need to connect a little cable to it and plug it into a USB slot and not all of the MBs have two free USB plugs inside you may need an internal usb hub.  Also, DO NOT plug in both the USB and the RGB cable, it will default to the RGB connection and you wont be able to control the ring.

  Upgraded from a Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 Just doing that I basically had to build another PC so why not go all out? I went with an AIO cooler, OC'able RAM, M.2 Drives Vega 56, the works!This thing is a beast and I've yet to tame it. The AIO cannot keep up so I've ordered a better AIO to see if it helps. I tried AI Suite 5 Way Op - it got to 8% then stops because temps are critical and it throttles. I uninstalled SUITE and went with RYZEN master and it's all fine and good if you want to idle at 30 and under load hit 80+Also, Ryzen does NOT like OC'able RAM. You are far better off doing everything manually in Bios than by using software like Suite and Master. I was able to get all cores running at 4.1 but I have some more work to do because as soon as I start OC the RAM the whole system crashes and I'm back running optimized defaults.Overall though this is a significant upgrade to previous CPU and if you are considering a TR and you are NOT an architect/Engineer this CPU is excellent choice for gaming and entertainment.

  I had originally purchased the 2700. On my mother board by default the base clock hovered in the 3.5GHZ range and would boost to 4.15GHZ. My Max all core stable OC was 4.1GHZ.With the 2700x as you can see the base clock sits around 4.1GHHZ all core with boosts into the 4.4GHZ range.Again in both instances this is what the AMD driver set the clock speeds to based on my motherboard/psu/cooling. The 2700x in default preformed slightly better than the 2700 with the 4.1GHZ all core manual OC in all benchmarks and will do much better in applications that require the extra 300MHZ boost.

   The 2700x is currently the most highly rated gaming cpu per TomsHardware.com and PCGamer.com.  In my opinion, the bang for the $ is much better than an equivalently-rated I7 CPU.Bottom line: I highly recommend the 2700x.  It and it's Wraith cooler are really easy to install and the 2700x is similarly easy to overclock.  The Wraith Prism LED has just the right amount of bling and comes with a square thermal pad that matches the 2700x footprint exactly.**Buyer Beware: Do NOT order any extra thermal paste.  It's simply not needed.  Also, even if the shipping package is unopened, it still cannot be returned for a refund.  (I learned the hard way.)

  I picked this up on Black Friday for an amazing 159$. I am coming from an AMD FX-6300 and I am very happy with this chip. I paired it with the GTX 1660 Super and all of my games are defaulted to ultra (gears 5, overwatch, pubg). It’s very fast. I haven’t had a chance to do any thing to push it more but you don’t need too. It was this or the 3600x. I am happy with this one. More threads for less money. Awesome deal if you can get it for less than 200.

  If you are on the fence about this processor I can give you some real world examples of where it helps. Blender if you animate using blender this processor can pump out a standard HD animation in the time it take to play it. Premier pro, this processor is more than capable of rendering videos effortlessly while you do something else. Gaming, I have not seen a single CPU bottleneck that this processor caused. it's a great chip if you are looking for that power to do more than just game on your pc and when it come to recording game play or streaming it's absolutely amazing.

Worth it

  I went from an Intel 6700k to this Ryzen 2700x and so far I am not regretting it. I have not tried any games yet but doing normal stuff in Windows, installations and using Google Chrome (specially with multiple tabs open) there is a noticeable speed increase. I have not tried to overclock it yet but I notice when using CPU-Z the Ryzen will boost itself up to 4.3 Ghz under load.I will also toss in a positive review for the Wraith Prisim Cooler it came with. It was easy to install, it seems to do a decent job at keeping the 2700x cool, and it looks cool with the LEDs. Some have complained about the noise, but for me it's not bad at all. The Corsair AIO I had in my previous build was quite a bit louder. I was planning on going with a new AIO for this, but I may have second thoughts after seeing the Prisim Cooler in action. So far I have yet to see the CPU temps go over 55c.

Excellent multitasking processor

  Never built a desktop before now but I wanted something that could do a ton of things at once and this is what I hoped for and got. Sure the i7-8700K may be better for gaming but sometimes I like editing videos at the same time as playing games and this does it well. The prism cooler is tough to install on a Gigabyte Gaming motherboard but that's the only gripe I have and it's probably not the cooler's fault.Overclocks to 4.0GHz out of the box and plays Ghost Recon Wildlands at 60-80 FPS with a 1070Ti with respectable temps (between 55-65C) so it can handle anything.

Almost No Bottlenecking!

  When I was doing research on this processor, a lot of resources told me it would cut the performance of my 1080 Ti in half. What I found is that when I overclocked the Ryzen 7 2700x to 4.1 ghz, that it was almost the exact same as a an Intel CPU, just with more cores and better for multi-threaded applications. However, the reason I give it 4 stars or gaming and not 5 is because although it performs well in gaming, Intel still beats it. These Ryzen chips are great for people who want to game and work on their systems. If your a person who ONLY plays games, then get an Intel. But if you game AND do other things this CPU is 100% for you!

Excellent performance without an overclock

  After killing an 1800x with too long of an overclock I replaced it with the 2700x,  the overall stability is just way better.  I found I didn't need to overclock the 2700x to get better perceived performance then the 1800x on an OC.  The 1800x by the way just slowly became more and more unstable over about a years time on an overclock.  I started overclocking with an 80286 so I have a little experience managing thermals and voltages.

  Recently decided to try AMD for the first time mostly because of my budget and a recommendation from a friend. I use to have an Intel Core i5 4690k @ 3.50GHZ and was looking to upgrade my rig but my budget was roughly $600.. Was going to originally buy an Intel Core i5-9600K 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor - That was priced at $250 but was told by multiple friends that the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X is equivalent to an Intel Core i7 and some online posts have said that the performance on the Ryzen 7 is actually better - And all for the price of $250 the same price as the Intel i5 I was going to buy..Fast forward a week and I got my Ryzen 7 2700x with my new motherboard! I've been told the con to buying an AMD is that they get really hot - I was idling around 55-65*C  and when I played Rainbow Six Siege or any high demanding game it would jump to 86*C - The Wraith Prism LED Cooler is not ENOUGH for this Ryzen 7.I would highly recommend buying a cheap Liquid Cooler - I just purchased the Cooler Master MasterLiquid LC240E / That was roughly $70 - I'm now idling at roughly 35-40*C and when Gaming it's at roughly 45-50*C! So a big fat jump from 86*C to 45-50*C just because of the Liquid Cooler.Overall everything seems to be running great! I'm enjoying AMD so far, I would highly recommend getting a CPU Cooler just makes everything easier in the end.

  As far as processors go, there are a few things to note anout this one in particular:1. Easy to install-- if you're new to PC building, just find yourself a short video and you'll be fine.2. Comes with its own cooler and fan combo (also has LEDs), and the cooler assembly already has cooling paste on it, but the factory stuff is weak sauce. Replace it.3. This thing SHREDS. If you're looking to be able to game and stream from the same rig, this processor won't even break a sweat doing it. Overall, HUGE bang for your buck.Short of a Threadripper or an i9, this is probably your best bet.

  This much CPU for under $200 is bonkers. This card is such a great value. On my system with x470-F Mobo, 5700xt GPU, and 16 GB 3200 RAM, it runs at 34 C using the included air cooler and at 55 C while gaming. Out if the box it's giving 4.1GHz clock speed.Things to know:1. This card needs a GPU. You won't be able to use Mobo video outputs with this card.2. The stock cooler is beautiful and works surprisingly well.3. If you need to remove the stock cooler after install do yourself a favor and watch a video on how to do it on YouTube. The stock paste is like glue and if you try to pull the cooler straight off you risk yanking the CPU out of the socket like I did. Luckily all the pins were in tact.This card is great for gaming. Would highly recommend.

Perfect for streaming and gaming on the same PC
","

  After finally saving up enough to upgrade my PC, I chose to get the Ryzen 2700x since I like to play videogames, stream, and edit videos. Ryzens are good at multitasking and are a bit cheaper than Intel CPUs so I figured I'd give it a shot. I can say I'm glad I chose this CPU!I've been able to stream my games at 900p 60fps using x264 encoding (CPU encoding) while playing on high to ultra settings using my GTX 1060. It could probably handle higher quality streaming settings but crazy high quality settings for livestreaming are not viewable for those with lower connection speeds. My goal was getting at least 720p 60fps but I bumped up the resolution a bit and it looks great!I've noticed that adobe programs open much faster, run better, and videos export much faster. I haven't noticed many other speed improvements really, but if I upgraded from my HDD to an M.2 SSD my speeds should increase overall. My previous CPU was about 4-5x slower than this Ryzen according to benchmarks I've done so your improvement results may vary.I did notice that the stock cooler for the Ryzen has RGB and does a neat color cycle in the fan area and on an outer ring around it. I'm not crazy about RGB so everything I have came with what I bought, but I think it looks nice even though my case does not have windows to fully display it.The only issue I've had is that there appears to be an issue with the usb 3.1 gen 2 slot on my motherboard that has power or data transfer issues. I've heard this slot is controlled my the CPU so it is likely that the Ryzen isnt giving it enough power when it auto-throttles too high. I've seen many others have this issue using Ryzens (meaning not just the 2700x) with various boards and on both Windows and Linux, so it is likely a Ryzen or just a usb 3.1 voltage stability issue.

  Used to be an Intel guy, but AMD has won me over. Fantastic CPU, despite running quite hot under load.

At the time when I purchased was about $200 cheaper than a 8700k Intel and as I originally wanted to do a entirely AMD/ATI build went with the AM4 platform. Haven't really got into overclocking it yet, mainly left it at the stock settings; however plan on tinkering a bit with that as I have upgrade the PSU as well. Only con I could think of is that Wraith cooler. On the cooler it has a JRGB & a internal USB connection.

  Upgraded from a 4.7 GHz FX8350, my GPU is no longer bottle-necked by my CPU. This upgrade alone boosted my FPS 30 or more. Even though this is not a gaming CPU, I picked it up for gaming. It's design is strictly for creative software. But, I couldn't ignore the price. It's gaming performance is close enough and isn't much slower than 3rd generation. Wraith cooler reaches uncomfortable temps with this CPU, I wouldn't recommend using it for long.I mean, it can be used for gaming, I just did not want to get a 3rd gen so soon. I never enjoy buying day one hardware until it has matured for a year or two.

  The CPU arrived dead (with sketchy packaging and not looking brand new!) and the stock cooler was physically damaged under the fan upon opening the box.

No lag, no slow downs after hours of playing games watching a movie in the background and have a lecture going in the background while streaming, while burning a movie.  Seriously done all that all at once, and it feels like there is nothing loading in the background.  Nothing get this CPU down.

  Haven't tested with video editing yet, but 3D modeling/animation, video conversion, and gaming performance are all significantly boosted with this processor.  Of course, my previous processor was an A10-7850k, so pretty much anything would have boosted my PC's performance.  The only issue I have with it at the moment is that the fan revs up loudly sometimes for for a couple seconds for no apparent reason.  That's a minor concern, though, especially considering how great it's been so far.

  This CPU is generally really great. It performs well in games and boosts to 4.3 ghz. However when it boosts with XFR2 and Precision Boost, voltage temporarily increases, meaning temperature increases. On my system, with a Dark Rock Pro 4 cooler, my temps float between 33 and 44 Celcius, with the occasional spike into the 50s. I haven't noticed anything higher than 60 or 70 Celcius during gaming, so not a huge issue so far.

  Had to get a replacement (it happens sometimes) but it runs just fine. The only ""issue"" I found was the heat it makes. I highly recommend getting a top of the line cooler and thermal compound before using it for any form of work. (I have no issues with gaming with a low end cooler but I'll need to upgrade it)

  At this point it may be the top AMD processor that isn't thread-ripper.  If you need value look to a lower model, but its good and its ready made for over-clocking.  It comes with the Wraith Prism cooler which is the best performing of the Wraith series so far.  Good overall value.

  Everything runs great, easy to install for the most part and the stock cooler handles itself pretty dang well.

Great variable workload processor
","

  I've gotten 2 of these processors so far and have found them to be powerhouses when it comes to production workloads. In gaming they are on par with some less expensive, fewer core packed packages. As a general purpose processor they may be a bit overkill and they do run a little hot. The included cooler isn't as terrible as most would say but you will also not squeeze the most power out of the cores with it either.

  Most times playing an average game these days, the CPU would just coast at an average of 20% load; With other more demanding applications (either with a Digital Audio Workstation app, or a video compression app, or anything heavy duty - this cpu will take the cake... provided it doesn't bake you with it cause of its heat output at times)

Good cpu
","

  Stable, no issues. Wrote more about my feedback in regards to the platform on my board review. You can find plenty of reviews on this, but this is highly recommended. Great for gaming and software development.The performance is really strong, no blue-screens, and they did a good job of coaching/handhold the board companies to make sure they have their act together on this release.  I have only had it for a few days, but i didn't even need to reinstall my os from the previous cpu which was intel (your mileage will vary).  This is truely a great platform. And with amd you can upgrade your cpu in a couple of years, in the same board. They promised though 2020 support which means you get the 7nm cpu. Since there is real competition now you can expect some real innovation in the next couple of years, so this is a big deal from both intel and amd. It makes everyone betterNice to see amd back in the game. It has made a huge impact on cpu prices and feature set. The cooler also worked great for me. No temperature issues. The cooler is louder than what i liked. as a bit of an enthusiast i would rather have a larger but quieter fan on the board. The cooler is perfectly designed for this cpu. i would by default spend any money on an after market cooler 100 would be better used on a gpu or ram by far. Note you can also make sure your case has good airflow and go with simpler cooling solutions since you don't need to compensate for a bad case or case fan setup.Anyway, this is a great well rounded cpu. As a software engineer it is great to see fast compile times, and cores to spare for hyperv and docker. I can also play all the latest games just fine. though truth be told you can do that with a 150 dollar cpu. I didn't have any problems with Ram compatibility. I came from Haswell (intel) i dont' notice any difference in gaming (not expecting to) but productivitivy is a big boost. If you just game you really don't need this much cpu generally.

  In my search for parts for my PC the processor was a difficult choice as most good processors were in the $300+ range. However, this processor outperforms a great chunk of what’s out there and is relatively cheap. I previously had a 5th gen i5 and this is a crazy upgrade.

  There is nothing wrong with this chip or the fan other than the fact if your a noob to building PC's you might not know there is a good chance that you will have to update the bios to get it working. It's a slightly challenging process but once you get it done it will work like a charm.

AMD Has FINALLY won me back.
","

  Oh AMD... it has been far too long. At one point I loved AMD, but eventually over time their stagnation drove me away. Before I was going to build my rig, I was set on getting an 8700k. I am so glad I didn't.where the 2700x beats the 8700k:- Anything you want to do that can take advantage of the cores will beat the 8700k. This thing is a champ with multi-threaded processes.Where the 8700k beats the 2700x:- Gaming. Intel still has higher single core clocks and since most games don't take advantage of multiple cores this means the 8700k still beats the 2700x. The good news here is that doesn't mean the 2700x is bad. It is actually very good! But in 99% of games the 8700k is better. If you are a gamer the 8700k will probably be what you go with.Overall: I love this CPU. AMD has finally won me back from Intel. Although this chip may not beat the 8700k when it comes to gaming, it does beat it in practically everything else. To me this was more important and why I purchased it. I could have done a more technical write up but there are plenty of good reviews that touch more on numbers.

Flawless replacement - upgrade BIOS first!
","

  I replaced the 1700 I had in my Asus X370-Pro motherboard with the 2700X and it's been flawless.  Be sure to upgrade your BIOS before replacing the cpu as you might be running a BIOS that can't handle the 2700[X].I did mess around with overclocking but honestly there's no point overclocking the CPU if you have an air-cooled system.  The air cooling that comes with the 2700X is very good and there's no reason to replace it.  If you got the 2700 (non-X) and want to overclock that, you probably want to upgrade from the box cooler.  The 2xxx series CPUS are most sensitive to memory speed, so you will get most of the potential performance boost by buying high speed memory and enabling the profile in the BIOS (be sure to do that as stock settings will run the memory at 2133 otherwise).  The XMP2 auto core boosting profile gets you just about all the overclocking that the CPU can do in an air-cooled system without actually overclocking it.  (The 2700 non-X will be different... there O.C. CPU profiles are more useful).Of course, all bets are all if you liquid-cool.  Even so, precious few people have managed to get this cpu running at 4.3 GHz on all cores and personally I don't think its worth the hassle.  If you do intend to overclock the cpu, make sure the motherboard VRMs can handle it.  Power consumption rises very quickly.But by the same token, people who are looking for power efficiency can do the opposite... underclock the CPU instead of overclock it and get a good chunk of the performance back by plugging in high speed memory.  I've tried this combination and its decent.  It makes for a very quiet case and low component stress.  But yah... its fun to run the thing all out, too.Unlike when the Ryzen 1xxx series CPUs were released which required a year's worth of BIOS updates to get stable with high speed memory, BIOSes seem to be rock solid with the 2xxx series right out of the gate.  I've had no issues.-Matt

  If you like to overclock, this is a CPU you can go to town with. If you don't like to overclock or don't want to get involved, look away.

After overclocking this 2700X, I get about a 15% performance increase. Thats pretty good. Considering the price difference currently:1700X = $2802700X = $329Thats a $49 difference which is 17.5% improvement and exactly in line with price to performance.But like I said, you have to be willing to overclock it to get that performance boost. If you don't know how to overclock, there are plenty of YouTube videos that can help you out. But make sure you have purchased a very good liquid AIO cooler (important).If you already have a Ryzen 7 1700X/1800X, there really is no need to upgrade for the small performance improvement. With Zen 2 coming out in the future, its best to wait for that instead.If you are coming from the Intel world or older AMD CPUs, get this CPU and an X470 motherboard. I think you will be pleased with your purchase.

Blazing fast. With caveats.
","

  It's fast! And the cooler looks... well, cool!Overall, it's a great CPU. It beats  Intel i7 8700K in many benchmarks. However, there are several caveats:1. It's hard to find good DDR4 compatible with it. With most sets and motherboards, XMP profiles won't work. You will have to tweak BIOS settings (DRAM voltage and CAS timings) manually.2. Memory access latency (when accessing memory outside of CPU cache) is extremely high (about 3 times that of Intel CPUs - about 60 ns vs about 20 ns for Intel CPUs). So if you need it for running memory-intensive applications that access a wide range of memory addresses in a random manner, then Intel i7 or i9 will be a much better choice.3. It has only 16 PCI Express lanes. As a result, using more than one M.2, U.2 or PCIe SSDs may be a problem. For example, in order to use a Samsung 960 Pro M.2 SSD and an Intel Optane 905p SSD at the same time at full speed, I had to use a PCIe to M.2 adapter card in a PCIe 8x slot, which resulted in my GPU running at 8x speed in a PCIe x16 slot on my Gigabyte X470 AORUS Ultra Gaming motherboard. Fortunately, I did not need fast 3D graphics on that machine. So if you need more PCIe lanes then go for either Ryzen Threadripper or Intel CPUs.

  Not the fastest CPU, it doesn't have the most cores, and it isn't even the cheapest, but AMD has managed to pack some of the most impressive performance ever witnessed at this price point, and for that, I have no problem calling it (one of) the best CPUs ever released on the consumer market.If you put this thing on a good X470 motherboard, it's basically a plug-and-play experience to get optimal performance. XFR2 is amazing, and makes intel's Turbo scheme look amateur by comparison. Though it's most direct competitor, the 8700K is on average 20% faster (Particularly in gaming, so if you just care about Max FPS, probably look into that CPU instead) to get that kind of performance, you have to get really lucky (silicon lottery) or Delid the 8700K to get into 5GHZ territory, or 4.5GHZ All core overclocks.The 2700X will age much better than the 8700K though, as we're witnessing (even in gaming) an explosion of multi-threaded programming as developers shift into the next-generation APIs like Vulkan and DX12. So unless you're on the competitive game circuit, this is still probably a better bet than an 8700K for gaming, especially once you go up to 1440p where GPU lock is more common.

Value and performance leader! Best system I ever built! Buy premium components to get the most out of this processor.

  Best AMD build ever! MB is ASUS Crosshair VII HERO wifi (with latest BIOS). Memory is G.Skill FlareX 3200 CL14. With these premium quality components, I achieve a sustained OC of 4.2GHz with no errors or instability using Prime95 and AIDA64 extended torture testing. Memory running at 3200 CL13, which is significantly better than the default XMP settings of the ram. CPU and memory at recommended voltages. Passmark rates CPU performance of this build in the top 1% of the world. Included cooler works good, but is not suitable for serious overclocking like I have described above in gaming or other CPU intensive applications. I don't recommend 3466 DDR4. Buy ASUS QVL 3200 parts only, then tighten the timings for best performance. I also recommend an M2 drive as your boot drive. Anyway, the Ryzen 7 2700x is the most bang for the buck on the market today and I am 100% satisfied with my decision to purchase this AMD product.

I just installed Ubuntu 18.04 and so far everything is perfect. Man does this scream. I can kick off my builds and I'm done in about 11 minutes, which is down from 18 minutes on my Intel i7-6700k.After the Meltdown and Spectre problems with Intel, I jumped ship as quick as possible. I'm very satisified in the move to AMD. It has been almost 20 years since I owned an AMD CPU. Definitely worth the switch, especially for the money.

  Upgraded from a Intel I7 4790K, Happy with the purchase.. in gaming i dont notice any difference as im gpu limited with the 1080ti at 2560x1440p.  But for multi threaded apps its much faster...  Dont care much for the wraith cooler and i wish their was a cheaper 2700x option without a heatsink as i am watercooling my pc.This is the first AMD cpu i have had since my opteron 165 on my old Nforce 4 board back in i think 2004 ?  Im happy to see AMD FINALLY after 14 years back on top.  I bought mine at microcenter since they are cheaper at $300 and you also get $30 addtional off with a motherboard combo.  I purchased this cpu with a Gigabyte x470 Gaming wifi 7 board and 16gb of g.skill flare x memory.  Paired with my 1080ti.I know the 8700k is faster gaming wise, but i wanted something future proof.  With AMD ill be able to upgrade the cpu to the 7nm ryzen 2 when it comes out without needing a new motherboard

This is the same as the 50th anniversary for a bit cheaper BUT.. READ my review! :)
","

  I have nothing but praise for AMD, the company has such great morals and they treat their community with respect and love.To see them come out with a 50th anniversary edition of this chip I was enthralled to get my hands on the chip and put it through it's paces, although it wasn't much of a difference compared to the original chip, the extras made spending the bit extra well worth the $30 more I paid at the time.The T-Shirt that it came with fit really well and was nice and durable, also getting two games that were valued at over $100 was a great deal, Division 2 is a great game with lots of interaction and World War Z is a gorgeous amazing game as well. This is your decision to pick up the regular or 50th anniversary edition, but I can say without a doubt they are both fantastic and have the same performance.. so it's up to you if you want to spend a tad more and get the extras.The chip came nicely packaged in the AMD package and included the extremely nice AMD WRAITH PRISM RGB cooler that has two cables, WHICH IS CONFUSING FOR SOME people but please note the one is for your RGB header on your motherboard to control with your motherboard software and the USB cable is to hook up to your USB port on your motherboard and control with the AMD WRAITH PRISM software from their website. The cooler is gorgeous with it's bright addressable LED lights and shines bright just like a diamond! :) And paired with the software it works great and has a lot of options.The CPU, well I would sit here and go on and on about it, but I know you've all seen a lot of reviews and read a lot of reviews about the 2700X but all I can say is this is the fastest CPU I've ever owned myself personally and having 8 cores and 16 threads makes it tear through most workloads without any hassle. I have NOT overclocked this chip yet, but from other reviews I've seen I would be able to with no trouble from the CPU cooler that is included. The 3.7GHZ stock speed with 4.3 boost works great, I have noticed the boost kick in only when I am pushing my workload to use around 45% of the overall CPU and having 20MB of total cache is awesome as well.The heat level stays very cool at around 30C idle with the included cooler and I've only pushed it to around 68C at around a 70% load with the stock cooler, works FANTASTIC, I am also using ICY DIAMOND thermal paste.I can't say more about this company, they are a great company and I wish them the best of luck for many years to come, let's CRUSH Intel and show them whats up! :)

Great Value, Top-Tier Multi-Threaded Performance - The Ultimate Streaming Processor
","

  First off, I'd like to say that I have no dog in the ""Team Read"" vs. ""Team Blue"" fight. My personal desktop runs an FX-8350 while my laptops have i5s of varying age, all of which have served their purpose.The latest generation of Ryzens and Intel chips are all quality performers - you truly cannot go wrong with either, but there are specific instances where the Ryzen is the clear winner. Those are the instances I'll be talking about in this review.One of these factors is price. A top of the line Ryzen is much cheaper than an equivalent i7 or i9, comes with a stellar stock cooler where Intel does not, and has far cheaper and more ""future-proof"" motherboard options. In all but the most petty of scenarios, like squeezing a few extra frames out of single-threaded games in 4k, there is virtually no performance difference.So the clear winner, in my opinion, is the processor that delivers a comparable experience at a lower price. That's the Ryzen 2700x, hands-down.The second is intensive multi-threaded operation. This processor found its way into my girlfriend's Twitch streaming setup for this very reason - for a combo streaming/gaming machine, the Ryzen is the clear winner. Another friend with a nearly identical setup, on the same Internet connection, running a 7th-gen i7 simply cannot keep up without dropping frames or significant in-game stuttering in OBS.While Twitch or YouTube live streaming is something of a niche use-case, any multi-threaded applications will benefit here. Video/audio editors, large multi-layered image encoders, programmers compiling a lot, or heavy multi-taskers would do well to put a Ryzen 2700x at the core of their workstation and save a few bucks over Intel in the process.The only ding against the 2700x at present is that the 3000 series is on the horizon with a new, smaller nanometer die and is sure to deliver better performance. But that's been the case for Moore's Law since the 70s. If you can get a 2700x below MSRP after the 3k series comes out, you'll be getting a screaming deal.In short, the Ryzen is a great processor for multi-tasking workstations as well as gamers. If you're a live streamer who plays games and broadcasts from a single machine, the 2700x is a no-brainer.

Upgrade from 1700
","

  Without changing any of my hardware I was able to swap out my 1700 with this beautiful beast. Decided to even use the included cooler and without changing any settings the RGB looks stunning out of the box, the fading colors and rotating rainbow around the fan just make a mesmerizing display.A fair warning, my motherboard was struggling to comprehend the processor before embarrassingly late BIOS updates. I had a b350 and ran into very frustrating problems before a BIOS update (released literally days ago) fixed the issues. The computer wasn't booting half of the time, USB was disconnecting periodically and it was generally unstable. It's good to know that vendors are providing the updates to properly handle these processors thoughI've been hitting higher clocks out of the box than my overclocked 1700 which makes me very happy, if there was any latency in games before the upgrade they are all but mitigated now. Everything is noticeably snappier which is surprising but welcome. Skip the 1800X, if you want the highest end desktop Ryzen, the 2700X is a no-brainer.

  Running at 4.0 base 4.3 boost on my 370 Crosshair 6 Hero. It also idles at 25 degrees and hasn't seen it go much over 50 in limited testing. So far Ryzen 2 looks legit. Not a huge upgrade from my 1800x but I just couldn't resist. Ram latency also dropped slightly on same ddr4 3200mhz.

Solid CPU and excellent value, but marred by strongarming from Microsoft
","

  It's a pretty solid CPU with 16 threads on 8 cores which is great if you do any data crunching. Based on cpubenchmarks.net, it's one of the best in terms of bang for your back, and it's pretty close to the market leader in absolute power as well. Unfortunately, both major companies' newer processor are suspect from a privacy/security standpoint, but intel has a much worse reputation in that regard - as far as I know Ryzen doesn't have a remote shutdown feature or a radio in the CPU (intel does, look it up).The biggest negative of this CPU is that it requires an AM4 socket. Which means you also must upgrade your motherboard, which means you have to get new RAM (your old RAMs won't be compatible). This needlessly balloons the cost of upgrading by a few hundred. On its own, that wouldn't so bad - the new architecture is part of how the CPU gets its performance after all. But many AM4 motherboards on the market are trash, even more expensive ones. I had particularly bad experience with ASRock x470 (poor quality, crap drivers, atrocious tech support), often recommended for this CPU, definitely avoid that one and ASRock in general - I suggest getting Gigabyte or ASUS at least.Among other issues, by switching to this CPU you are losing Win7 support, because Microsoft decided to pressure AMD and mobo manufacturers to make people switch to Win10. The new x470 mobo chipset that comes with AM4 is USB3.0 only, for which Win7 doesn't have drivers, so you will have to patch the install media for it to even let you install (your existing Win7 install will probably break due to the hardware change). Eventually, I was able to install Win7, but it took several days and was very frustrating to troubleshoot. Note that Win7 does support some other AM4 CPUs, just not this one. Adding insult to the injury, it actually has much better performance on the unsupported Win7 than supported Win10.This comes with a fairly large stock cooler, which isn't great at keeping it very cool, but you should be okay if you're not OCing or pushing the CPU to its limit (with 8 cores, it's hard to imagine you would, if you're not the kind of person who automatically buys a cooler with their CPU). Granted, this CPU is specifically designed to be OC friendly, so not OCing it is a bit of wasted potential, but that's up to you. The stock cooler does have an annoying neon light with shifting colors - I could have done without the useless light pollution inside my case.In summary:* CPU has great performance, definitely a better choice compared to competing intel products.* Requires its own motherboard and RAM, which will cost you* Don't count on being able to use Win7 with it

  I have an I7-3770K and I wanted to build a second machine and use the 3770k as a NAS, I got this CPU on sale with the ASRock Taichi Ultimate board and 16GB DDR3200, and noticed a huge difference between the 3770K and this CPU, My passmark scores I didn't believe and I added my Samsung m.2 1tb I got on sale and instantly I'm booting into my OS in under 8 seconds with applications and VM's loaded and running. I now have a second machine same build but with 32GB DDR4-3600 both are watercooler with the Cosair H150i my main machine runs Dual 1060 Windforce video cards in SLI, as for my second machine, i've now installed linux, and have over 12 VM (Virtual Machines) running which allowed me to power down my 8350 as the TDP is high on it, I'm also in the processor of moving over all my VM's to this machine which will let me power down my old xeon 2670 (dual) as I run 3 4U Racks at home, they are my developmental servers, and when I'm finished with a project I move it to my dedicated server.My girlfriend said if these go on sale to get 3 more same board 32gb of ram for each.We are doing a massive cleaning, selling off our old equipment, smaller drives, and upgrade to larger drives, for instance we sold off 5 dell optiplex 990s SFF for a buy it now price, and a lot of 2tb drives, which we use to buy 10tb drives, HGST enterprise or WD Gold.

Excellent Value, Great Performance.
","

  I love this CPU. I was debating between this CPU and a 8700k and the 2700x was a clear winner after calculating all the part costs needed. First, Intel cpu itself is $30 more than AMD. An Aorus motherboard with 2 x m.2 ssd slots that i need for Raid0 was $23 cheaper for AMD than it was for  Intel. Unlike Intel, AMD comes with a free RGB cooler that looks awesome! A decent cooler for Intel, Hyper 212 evo is another $30. I saved $73 just for going with AMD. Very important is also that Intel runs hotter than AMD by roughly 10 degrees if you compare stock AMD and Hyper 212 evo coolers. Because of the higher running temperature of Intel, the cooler fan on Intel will run faster and be noisier than the AMD on moderate and heavy workloads, Of course i could have water cooled Intel and made it cooler and quieter than the stock AMD cooler but that would be another $70 on top of Hyper 212 evo cooler cost. (+$140 total vs AMD)Another great advantage of AMD is that i can upgrade to the upcoming CPUs with ease until 2020. Intel on the other hand usually doesn't support current generation of motherboards on next generation of CPUs.Now about performance. In gaming AMD is slower than Intel by ~10-15% on 1080p resolution. On 2K or 4K resolution the difference is only 0 - 5% which is negligible.The multitasking performance on applications is 20-25% better on AMD than on Intel and there are also 2 more cores for running virtual systems if needed.I bought a 4K 27"" inch monitor for $200 (Sceptre U278W) and a Nvidia Gtx 1060 6gb for $230 that was on sale and can't be happier. In games i lower the resolution to 2K and most of the games run at ~60fps while looking stunning. Low demanding games like Fortnite play great on 4K resolution on max settings.If you absolutely need that extra 10-15% advantage on 1080p gameplay on Intel, buy the Intel, it's still a great CPU. If you want substantially better professional work performance and want to save ~$70, money you could spend on better gpu, ssd, monitor or other peripherals, it's a no brainer, buy the AMD.

This thing will rival even the best i7 processors, but be careful when removing the cooler
","

  The R7 2700X may not have the single-core performance of a strong i7, but it more than makes up for that in its absurd multi-core performance. To be honest, you probably know what this chip is capable of if you're here.Unlike Intel's chips, AMD's Ryzen chips do not have any integrated graphics, meaning that your computer will fail to POST if you do not have a dedicated graphics card.The performance I've had with the 2700X alongside my RTX 2080 in every game has been more than sufficient enough to satisfy even the upper bracket of PC gaming enthusiasts. Tie this processor in with a good graphics card and you'll be able to run any modern game on maximum settings for years to come. That is a testament to its horsepower, as PC gaming largely uses single-core performance. Still, an i7 9700K or a decent i9 will perform better than a 2700X in games.However, if you plan to use your computer for anything more than just gaming, the 2700X will outshine the vast majority of the i7 lineup even at its lower price point. Video editing, database work, compiling and running code, and more go best with a 2700X (or a 3700X or 3900X if you can afford it). The performance of the 2700X is well-documented and I have nothing more to add to it, but I do want to talk about the cooler -- the Wraith Prism cooler that comes with the processor.Like most coolers, it comes with thermal paste already applied. It's not terrible, but replacing that paste with something popular would make a bit of a difference. You need to be very careful when taking off the cooler, or you will almost certainly rip the 2700X right out of its socket. If that happens, I hope you are prepared to catch it. If that chip falls to the ground, you'll get some bent pins. You can straighten bent pins out if you're skilled enough, but a few pins will likely break off from the drop. At this point, your $250 processor is now a $250 paperweight, and not a very good one at that (the chip is quite light).So, when preparing to take off the cooler, RUN A BENCHMARK OR SOME OTHER INTENSIVE PROGRAM FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES. This will heat up the processor and thus the thermal paste, making it softer. Then, when removing the cooler, TWIST THE COOLER BEFORE PULLING IT OUT. This will make the paste on the cooler and the processor let go of each other, or at the very least make the grip weaker so you won't rip the processor out. This is standard procedure for removing any cooler, but it's more important with this one since the AM4 socket is notorious for not having as strong a grip on the processor as, say, a Skylake or Kaby Lake socket.

Buggy, picky about memory, gets pretty hot on a slight overclock (<10%)
","

  After finally getting my computer to post after 5 hours of scratching my head, I finally got a chance to see what Ryzen was all about. Maybe the x470 Asus board was defective. Maybe the processor came from a bad batch. Maybe my memory isn't as good as I thought it was. All I know is that I've never had this kind of issue with stability as I did with AMD.I purchased a 2700x along with the Asus x470 Crossfire Hero mobo to replace my i7-6700k and z170 board. I was looking to upgrade my core/thread count without breaking the bank. I already had 32GB of Trident Z 3000mhz that conveniently had Samsung B-die on them. I have a 256GB NVME boot drive that I replaced with a Corsair 1TB NVME drive.After reassembling my tower with the new equipment, I fired it up to see what this thing had under the hood. I was quickly met with a repetitive loop of Q codes indicating a memory issue. After testing each stick one by one in each slot to no avail, I finally decided to try a new set of memory from the local brick and mortar BB. No dice.I checked that the processor was seated properly, that the ram sticks were all seated properly, and that all power connectors were securely fastened. Let's try clearing the CMOS. Yep, that did it. Now we're cooking with gas......well, until I tried enabling the XMP profile. Back to the memory issue.I cleared the CMOS again, and went back into the BIOS settings. This time, I manually entered the voltage to 1.35v and set the timings up to what they are supposed to be. Saved, exited, rebooted just fine. Got windows to install just fine. Ran windows update, ran the Q installer to install the Asus chipset and driver software, then rebooted. Oh boy, here we go again. After playing around with bios for a bit, I was able to tune the memory well enough to survive reboots. Awesome, right? Wrong. So very wrong. This is an unlocked processor, with a mid to high end tweakable mobo. It should have been able to handle basic overclocks. It did not. In fact, it became less and less stable on reboots as I went along, even when resetting it to default settings.I have a mid tower gaming case with two front fans, bottom fan, rear exhaust fan, and an AIO h100i (thank goodness I heard my original boxes. The connections to the motherboard are different on AMD than Intel) cooling the CPU and case. I'd say the cooling is adequate. My 6700k never eclipsed 80c, even under the most torture I could give it. The 2700x hit 90c on a 5% OC. What grease did I use, you might ask? Kryonaught Grizzly.I tried to give it a chance for 3 days, but having it act up when trying to remote into work isn't going to cut it. I sent it all back and replaced it with a 9900k and an Asus Z390-e board. The mobo was cheaper, but the CPU cost me another $140. The board was $30 cheaper than the x470, so $110 difference I can live with that (got a sweet deal on the 9900k at 10% off of a $479 starting price). It was worth every penny. Not a single boot issue, not a single issue with any one stick of my 32GB of memory, and my temps with a modest 5.0mhz on all cores barely gets into the 70s with the temps. This thing is a beast.Pros for the 2700x:Price8 cores/16 threadsComes with a cool looking cooler if you need oneCons:Buggy/unstable (for me at least)High tempsPicky about what memory it will useIf you are strapped for cash and don't mind having to become a computer engineer to tweak it to death just to get it to run, then give it a shot. I've been building my own computers since the 90s, and have never had as much trouble with getting a computer to boot and stay up as I did with this thing.If you can spend a little more, and want to ensure you have as hassle-free of an experience as possible while also gaining additional performance, then stick with Intel. Performance per dollar is a weak argument. I could see that argument if the 2700x and 9900k were equals, but they aren't. The 9900k is worth every penny I paid for it over the 2700x.I do not recommend this processor. I'll admit it could have been the board that was buggy, but I'll never know. I couldn't be more pleased with the 9900k. It's over twice as powerful as my 6700k was.

  I'm impressed with my Ryzen7 2700X.  It definitely makes a difference.  From my i5 system I've had over 4 years I started with a Crucial SSD upgrade, and that made a huge speed difference, and it replicated my hard drive perfectly.  After that I then wanted to upgrade the CPU and graphics.  Got some better deals locally from a large computer chain store.  But the problem with upgrading the CPU here is I needed new motherboard and also new RAM, which makes the whole process more expensive.  Thats really the only downside.  I also added a MSI AMD580X graphics card which was a good deal and is plenty fast for me.  Now some other issues -After the MB and CPU swapout - Microsoft WIndows 10 lost its activation and gives me the message to Activate WIndows, and it won't accept the old key.  My PC has been up for about 9 years now and this is the 2nd motherboard upgrade I've done so my Win 10 was the MS upgrade.  So that is an annoyance but I can still do everything, including updates.  But overall the system is running great and I'm doing games as well as running some VM as well and everything is very quick.

  PROs:-Fast CPU with 8 cores + 16 threadsCons:-Runs hot.  Approaching 80C when fully loaded.  AMD has already factory overclocked the CPU.  The heatsink can't keep up with the CPU.-Random system freezes at idle when ASUS default BIOS setting is used.  This is a QA miss on AMD's part.  The freeze happens when the system goes into lower power c-state.I shouldn't have to spend a week doing QA for AMD.  The solution to the system freeze problem is to change a couple BIOS settings.  1)  Turn ""Global c-state""  off  2)  Change ""Power Supply Idle Control"" to ""typical""  instead of ""AUTO"".  The system is stable afterward.  This issue is very common with 2700x and may or may not happen with other CPU models.

The 2700X comes with its own cooler which helps bring down the cost of my build and couple with a MSI Tomahawk MOBO its been great.A word of advice, the cooler has 2 settings a low and high rpm which is next to the RGB and USB pins. If you decide to run it at high RPM i would recommend removing the AMD sticker especially if yours isn't well centered. On low, the sticker doesn't seem to cause any issues but on high you may develop a rattle when the fan slows down and removing the sticker seemed to help remove the noise. If you hear a rattle from the fan it might be worth a try.

  I just put together a 2700x build and I couldn't be happier. My intention was to get the best bang for buck processor that could handle any games I throw at it and also handle some heavy use in music production.For gaming so far it has not even come close to struggling. Paired with a RX580 and 32GB of ram it seems like it will handle anything. Granted I don't game extreme like some people. I have only tested it with Madden19 and CSGO so far but both are maxed out and running flawlessly. I would imagine some of the most intense games will force me to tweak the settings a bit to keep it running smooth but I also only have a mid range GPU in comparison to whats out there.I haven't tested it for recording but I already know it will beast through that as well.Now.. performance aside.. the thing that I love most is how awesome the stock cooler is. I have heard you can even Overclock without needing to swap it out. I don't plan to OC so I will probably just stick with the prism cooler it comes with. Its sexy and has awesome air flow. When I had my case open I could feel air from across the room like I had an actual room fan going. And again.. just beautiful to look at with the RGB fan + ring going around it.I'm sure I will upgrade away from it within a year or 2 since I was kind of late to join the Ryzen club.

  The Ryzen 7 2700x is quite simply the best CPU I have ever had the pleasure of owning, and simply put it preforms way better than expected. It has no issue with any task or game thrown at it, and video editing, rendering, and other heavily tasking applications are a breeze for this CPU. The stock fan is actually quite good for what it is. Although it really isn't capable of over clocking, it definitely preforms well at stock speeds and is very quiet. The dual channel RGB lights are also a nice addition for computer cases with transparent panels, and accepts most RGB adjusting programs, like AURA Sync from ASUS. In conclusion, if you want high-end performance for 300 dollars, this CPU is the way to go.Pros --Easy to install.-Thermal paste pre-applied to heat sink.-Blazing performance.-Runs cool on stock cooler.-Quiet.-Amazing value for performance.Cons --Delicate Pins.-Thermal paste may allow the CPU to adhere to the heat sink.

","

  Great performance but burned out after only 3 weeks of encoding at stock settings. I constantly monitored temps and at load was only 65-70C so that's wasn't a problem.  Amazon is replacing it but this chip completely burned out on me;  I was running it on an AsRock AB350M.  It is possible the board is to blame as it is one of the crappiest boards I have ever owned. In 20 years of building PCs I have never seen this before.  The chip had a brown burn spot on the pins and smelled like fire as did my entire room.  I ordered an MSI B350 Tomahawk to put the replacement chip into which should be better.  Hopefully this never happens again because the performance was very good.  Should get the replacement in a couple of days.UPDATE:  Changing to 1 starI contacted AMD and they told me that they would not cover this under warranty.  I will probably never buy another AMD chip.  I have mostly built Intel systems and never had anything remotely like this happen.  No way can I recommend investing $400 into a CPU if they won't even cover catastrophic failures.  They didn't even ask to see the chip.  I had run a 1600X on that board for several months without an issue. All I did was update the bios, drop in the 2700X and everything appeared fine. How can they refuse to replace the chip?  I am sure AsRock isn't going to buy me a new chip.  Luckily, Amazon replaced the chip in the 30 day window and I am sure AMD will not stiff Amazon on the return, but it seems they were plenty willing to stick it to me.

  Bought this processor to run with my new Asus Crosshair VII x470 motherboard. Installed fine, turned it on and then I heard a subtle but very noticeable rattle from the Wraith Prism cooler. Unacceptable and annoying in my eyes. I know I installed it properly, I was very cautious about that. Anyways, upon trying to remove the cooler from the top of the processor for return (they're a package deal) the cooler pulled the processor out of the motherboard completely.

  Alright so the people saying the 2700x beats the I7 8700k in gaming are wrong. Everything else though it rocks. The single core performance won’t beat a 5hz overclock on the 8700k so for gaming that’s the only reason is beats the Ryzen cpus. But if you are buying a 8 Core 16 Thread CPU. Losing 20 or so FPS at 1080P isn’t the reason you are buying a high core count CPU in the first place.

  Currently facing problems with it even booting into the bios. No display when turning on system. All LED’s and fans running. It might be because I have a Crosshair vi hero which hasn’t been updated onto the newest bios and I don’t have any older chip to update it. It just sucks how I can’t use the new cpu with an older motherboard. I tried flashing the bios with the newest version,which doesn’t require the cpu but ended up with no luck.UPDATE 6/8/18When first installing I experienced some problems even booting up.

  TRIGGER WARNING: The following review will most likely trigger your fragile little feelings if your daily dose of tech news comes from WCCF.P.S. my purchase was from Micro Center but no one reads the reviews there.Purchased and quickly returned.UPDATE:6 customer builds later and only 1 of them was satified with the performance ""upgrade"" and the one that was satified was coming from the old 920 i7. 3 of them have gone back to intel platforms and have had no complaints.Updated score to reflect the experiences. Trigger warning for AMD nutthuggers still remains, sorry.CONS:1. Weaker than my 8700k at stock and it cant hold a candle to the performance of an 8700k when over clocked to 5.3@ 1.28v. (binned chip)2. No overclocking head room unless you are going the LN2 route.3. Runs too hot for my tastes under load. Although the updated prism cooler is leagues better than the failure that was wraith cooler. Needs water cooling to even be considered an option.4. Prism cooler uses the horribly bad clamping systems (whatever you want to call it)5. A better competitor to the 7 series intel cpus.6. 8700Ks are the same prices an leagues betterPROS:1. Better stock cooler then last ""gen""2. Better stock thermals then intel cpus (but gets laughed at like an anime nerd on prom night when both are water cooled)3. Great for budget content creatorsFYIWhile not AMD's fault, the new mobos for these cpus aren't quite ready and memory issues galore.i build many custom PCs every month and none of my customers are requested these, yet.Just stick with Teams Green and Blue.

  I picked an Asus b450 mb, originally with a 3700x and corsair vengeance ram.  Got the ram and the mobo quickly, the 3700x kept having it's date pushed back so I cancelled it and got the 2700x for a better delivery time also to remove the worry about having to update the bios so the 3700x would work.  Got the 2700x a few days later and put it together with a coolermaster hyper612 v2 I already had. The bios was up to date (nice), I was seeing 4.291ghz, just short of 4.3 ghz, again good, but ram was 2166 instead of 3200.  Youtube search and found the bios adjustment to get the rated 3200mhz for the ram, couldn't be happier.  This replaced a e5-1680v2 which I gave my wife that couldn't be overclocked on an unbranded mobo.  Also bought the 4 yr. warranty for both cpu and mobo, just in case.  Mobo was $80, ram was $80 cpu $197, had everything else laying around, really can't beat Ryzen price/performance availability.Update:  I am occasionally seeing 4.5ghz and I did not overclock.

  Put this in my buddy's gaming build that I built him since he mostly plays league of legends. The included fan tends to keep everything cool just fine with the normal overclock that AMD's software provides. The fan RGB is also quite nice, especially in the all black build we did. One thing I would recommend is making sure to wipe your hard drives fully if you are switching over from an intel processor. Doing the Windows 10 driver removal for switch processors can cause glitches, freezing, and overall unreliability of your system.

  Caught this on Cyber Monday for $172 after tax. Switched from an Intel i-3, which isn't a fair comparison, but does relieve the cpu bottleneck when paired with a GTX-970. Games run much smoother now at 1080p, 60fps.I have noticed that the temperatures tend to spike between 30-40c. At first I thought it was a poor thermal paste job, which I checked and was good. Played with fan curves a bit, which fixed the fan noise, but not the temperature spikes. After some digging in the AMD reddit and forums, the temperature spikes are normal behavior. Just so you're aware if you're coming from Intel. As long as your thermal paste decorating is good, it's seated good, it's normal. That said, if you find fan noise, like it's spooling up and then spooling down, a little irritating, set the fan curve above the highest temperature spike.

Great cpu,
","

  The included Wraith Prism Fan and heatsink although nice to look at does not keep the cpu cool enough, better to include a liquid cooler as standard, but this is for AMD who produces the combo not the seller. Other than that A very good processor.

It's worth it
","

  I'm writing this months after I bought it, and doubtless it's cheaper now, so I'm just happy it worked.My motherboard had problems booting up when I first got it, but now it boots every time, no waiting, with very fast memory (not samsung memory, Hynix)

  Amazon ad reflects false information about this combo on this product , it will not function properly on 16GBs of Ram , it needs at least 32 GBs to work .

runs a bit toasty for me with the stock cooler
","

  I set to auto overclock and it runs quite hot for me (45-55c) at 4.0ghz . I set it to base speed and its around 42-45c. I would recommend getting a good cooler if you plan to use this all day/overclocking.

  Nice multicore processor for a great price, since the newer ones came out. And does not suffer from the big performance hit that Intel chips have from the vulnerability mitigation last year.
