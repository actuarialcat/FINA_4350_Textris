Holy crap, this thing's fast
","

  Holy crap, this thing's fast. I upgraded from a 4 core I7 Intel processor. My old rig couldn't keep up with editing 4K video without badly stuttering. This thing does 4K previews with transitions and effects at something like 20% CPU utilization. I did mate it with a killer graphics card (ASUS ROG-STRIX-GTX1080TI 11GB), but this CPU deserves the best! I'm not an overclocker, so I'm not pushing the limits, but I suspect this thing has enough horsepower for anything without overclocking.I had never built a water cooled rig before, but it was pretty straightforward. I used an all in one NZXT Kraken X52 and it works fine.For the motherboard, I used a ASRock X399 Professional Gaming board, populated it with 64 GB in four 16 GB DDR4 2400 ECC Kingston Valueram. I like the fact that AMD allows this ""consumer"" CPU the ability to use ECC RAM, unlike Intel which now requires the use of the ""server"" chips if you want to use ECC.The only integration glitch I had was installing Windows 10 - I had to disable the IOMMU option in the BIOS (I think it was buried in the Northbridge or Southbridge sub menu).

Unbelievably good performance and price. Perfect for high-end DCC applications
","

  I have to admit, I'm completely blown away. I've hand-built 30+ PCs in my life, and every single one was Intel-based. There was a time when AMD simply couldn't compete on anything but price, which was never of interest to me because I value performance. I lean heavily on my computers for high-end 3D animation/design/rendering work, as well as gaming and other common functions. I bought this processor to test as a potential replacement for my existing rig, which had two 10-core Xeon chips ($1,000 each) on a server-grade motherboard. This 1950x CPU shreds that setup in Cinebench and real-world render times, is way faster to boot up, runs cooler and was almost 1/3 the cost! It's been completely reliable and capable. Seriously, if you're the kind of person who's always built around Intel CPUs, now is the time to reconsider AMD.I would highly recommend this CPU to anyone who needs lots of cores for 3D/DCC or other applications that will benefit from having 32 threads.

Blazing Saddles!

  I'll try to keep this short - IM A GAMER (along with other things) AND THE PERFORMANCE IS GREAT! BF4/BF1/Battlefront 2 all run fine! Witcher 3 got a Ryzen update and is SMOKING my intel i7 4930k. Most PPL come from intel backgrounds and thats fine - theres a bit of a learning curve here. If your having performance issues download (from AMD of course) AMD RYZEN MASTER - its a program that allows you to set your CPU up or revert it back to stock... Whats important is that you set your memory to LOCAL mode and leave legacy compatibility mode OFF (keeps all the CPU' cores enabled). BOOM there was the performance I was looking for! I Game but I also edit and upload the video's on Twitch/YouTube. The Handbrake encoding speed is nice. Halving the time it took before. There were some hiccups with the motherboard initially but its all been ironed out. I cant believe the memory speeds Im hitting with this - nearly 90GBps on the ram in quad channel config @ 2400mhz. I had the same speed ram in DDR3 on my i7 4930K and the best I saw was around 24GBps! (both 32GB quad kits / G.skill tridentZ RGB vs RipJawZ @ 2400MHz).It's MASSIVE! and when you first hold it the thing youll notice is the weight - its HEAVY. What a beast of a CPU.  ALWAYS REMEMBER TO GET THOSE BIOS UPDATES FOR x399!!!! Especially if your using the Gigabyte.What can I say I love it, it's fast and if you like video editing your in for a TREAT! Adobe needs to get After Effects/PremierePro updated since it can only use 18 cores but Im seeing software get updated to take advantage of Ryzen so fast.Overclocking is fine and all but unless you NEED to, I wouldn't OC right off the bat. Im cooling mine with the Fractal Design S36 and when Im transcoding videos in handbrake I average around 63.5c and thats with stock thermal paste. Im waiting for my new PC case to put arctic silver on. Some idoits say Threadripper runs hot - complete BS! Its thermal shut off diode is at 115c! Its rated to run 68c 24/7 - so yeah stock its cool. Idle temps right now for me are 32c. using HWinfo64 I can see my entire mobo is using 120 watts idle and with a full workload averages about 350 watts not counting GPU's. I have it on an Corsair RM850 and its powering the CPU fine (even when I did OC for some testing).Dont let it sit in your case with a slow SSD SATA hard drive  - give this hungry mother what it wants - a full blown PCIe x4 m.2 drive! Its just begging for one and most of the motherboards can feed it up to 3 of these with native ports! FYI AMD just released full m.2 nvme RAID support driver (which is a bit psychotic) but I guess if you need 20GBps read/write hard drive speed - have fun! Intel is BLOCKING this on their non Xeon boards...Conclusion - Im an intel guy and Im having a BLAST with the Threadripper. Its exotic and different in a way I like. Im not a guy who like the status quota - I like things free and open for me to have my way with and AMD has given me just that! No more restrictions and BIG BROTHER saying what I can and cant do. This firecracker is lit and ready to explode.

No regrets! Awesome 4K plus video editing beast.
","

  Threadripper is great for editing hi-res video like 4K or up to Red 8k footage. My old Intel i7 4 core chip could not handle 8K even at 1/4 resolution in Premiere Pro and I had to use proxies to edit. Threadripper rips right through the footage no problem, I'm almost able to play full resolution smoothly on the timeline it just drops a few frames. Smooth at 1/2 res through. Render times are equally impressive. If you use Lightroom or Photoshop it works good too, however if those are your primary programs then I recommend going for the fastest clocked CPU you can get as they don't use multiple threads that well and I have noticed slightly slower performance using Threadripper versus my old Intel i7 running at 4.3GHz. However Threadripper is super easy to overclock using AMD's program Ryzen Master and definitely helps improve performance in certain applications. Gameplay is awesome for a workstation CPU and plays all the latest games at very high detail and is only about 20-30FPS slower than a fast Intel CPU. Some early reports were that Adobe Premiere Pro CC was not working well with Threadripper, not using the multiple cores well but I'm seeing all 32 threads being used at 100% utilization while editing Red footage and about 60% average GPU usage. I think most of the problems that you may read about were caused by early Motherboards especially the ASUS boards. I'm using the Gigabyte X399 Designare EX Motherboard and it was super easy to install the CPU and setup and has been very stable. Just make sure when you install the CPU to tighten each screw in order 1-2-3 a little bit at a time, then go back and tighten them all they way 1-2-3 in that order and you should have no problems. I also recommend using the Enermax LIQTECH TR4 240-360mm AIO Liquid CPU Cooler which runs very quiet keeps the CPU cool running at idle around 30C and under full load around 50C.

Great CPU, just research & plan out your motherboard and RAM carefully, it's not one size fits all
","

  There are a lot of claims going around that this CPU requires water cooling so I tested it. Mine easily and stably overclocks to 4.0GHz with a single-fan noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3. Could possibly clock a little higher with liquid cooling but I haven't attempted it, even though there's plenty of thermal headroom. My CPU only runs a degree or 2 hotter with the noctua than with h115i. This processor also plays nice with high speed RAM, just make sure you get an asus motherboard if you want to hit 3600mhz on 128GB. I tested 3600mhz on 64gb with the zenith extreme and it works, but I ultimately chose the asrock x399 fatal1ty professional gaming for size reasons and my GPU wouldn't fit on the first slot of the zenith extreme. There are lots of other benefits to the asus boards but there are some unique benefits to the fatal1ty board, like onboard 10G lan for what that's worth. So with the asrock board I've been able to run 3200mhz on 64gb. It doesn't say anywhere in the manual or elsewhere that the board does not support 3600mhz, but if you select 3733mhz, it will revert to 2166 when you boot into windows. And when I selected 3600mhz, it'd boot and run at that number but crash as soon as i ran a program like google chrome. Tried it at lower and lower rates until I got to 3200mhz which is completely stable, so I'm guessing that's just a known limit but asrock's customer support is unaware of it. So yeah the threadripper is an amazing CPU but there are some things you gotta plan out in advance for your system. By the way, if you want to boot off an NVMe RAID array, this is definitely the platform to go with. The setup isn't trivial but it's this versus intel VROC, so there you go.

Great Product!
","

  Pros:-Extremely fast-Price for value is great!Cons:-Had some challenges getting it to run at optimal performanceOther Thoughts:Unlike some, I found the installation to be very straightforward. The best tip I would provide is to screw in the number 1 screw a little, then the number 2 screw, then the number 3 screw. Then go back and tighten them all up.A few tips to save time on optimizing.First, make sure you are running four sticks of quad channel memory. Dual channel really hurts your performance.Second, turn off IOMMU in the northbridge bios settings. This also hurts performance.Third, turn off HPET in the bios settings. This KILLS performance. Prior to getting this turned off, my FPS were half what they are now, programs were slow to load, etc....With these three items out of the way, I am having a GREAT experience. Wonderful CPU. Everything loads instantaneously.

  I'm always a little hesitant about performance specs you read online, but this is the first system I've built in a while that I have been very impressed with. AMD has finally made some chips that I prefer over Intel.The one thing I'd change about my build would be doing a CPU water cooler instead of the ""high-end"" heatsink I purchased. As with most AMD chips, the temperatures get pretty high, and I'd have liked to have a little more room to push the CPU.Ultimately, even with zero overclocking, it performs incredibly well. I'm able to edit 8k RED footage at half res fairly seamlessly.Specs: AMD 1950x, 64GB RAM, SSD for main OS, NVIDIA 1080 TII edit over the network using theOther additional hardware:Synology DS1817+ NAS with an added 10-gigabit network card.D-Link DXS-1100-10TS (Network Switch)ASUS XG-C100C 10G Network Adapter (for my desktop computers)CAT 6a network cables (to get 10-gigabit speeds)With this setup, I get transfer speeds averaging 650MB/s.

Great for multistream 4k video editing
","

  I think this is a great CPU. It is relatively easy to install if you get a motherboard with the Lotes CPU Socket - not Foxconn! Foxconn is horrible (see reviews online about it). I have only played a few games on it (Fallout 4 mostly) and it has no problem in 1080 Ultra settings (but that's mostly GPU anyway - which I'm getting a slight bottleneck due to going with a midrange video card due to budget restraints).I got this CPU for 4k video editing. I'm using Vegas Pro and a few other editing programs, and coming from an old i7-2600k, it blows it out of the water (I mean, if I were liquid cooling - which I'm not. I'm using the Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3 and it works great with it).I can render out a 10 minute 4k edited project with 5 audio and video tracks (complete with color grading and multiple effects) downsampled to 1080 24p (16MB bit rate) in about 6 minutes. Then I can take that same completed 10 minute 1080p video and render that out to DVD 24p  (720x480, 8MB) in 57 seconds.I've only had the Threadripper 1950x for a few days, so I'm still testing and playing around with it - but I love it so far!

This CPU makes it possible to build an affordable workstation with 3.7GHz 10+ cores

  Threadripper CPU made it possible for me to build an affordable workstation around $2000-$3000 with 3.7GHz 10+ cores.  I am not an experienced PC builder, but it was breeze for me to replace my 6-year-old Dell XPS by just assembling Prime X399-A, TR 1920x, EVO 970, Crystal 570x, a couple of SP140 fans.Since this CPU allows not only 2-digit number of cores but also 64 PCIe (3.0) lanes, you can add 3-4 graphics cards for high-performance computing. Simple Cinebench test (R15) of the system revealed 93.85 fps for OpenGL and 2234.cb (multicore) 150 cb (single core) for CPU without OC.If you want to build one like this with an Intel CPU having same number of cores but less core speed (2.7GHz) and less number of PCIe lanes, it would cost $5,000-$6,000.  Thus, I am more than pleased with this CPU and would highly recommend it.

Great bang for the buck

  I purchased it during the fire sales and for 12 cores/24 threads it's a down right bargain. Great way to get into threadripper and you can probably upgrade (to a second generation) down the road to much more performance at another bargain price... by waiting for the third generation or close-out.Using Ubuntu and Windows it's not quite as bullet proof as Intel although after a little work it runs great and out performs the i7-8700K (all cores @ 5 GHz) I was using previously. Only complaint is it runs rather hot (even being water cooled) and will throttle itself accordingly.

Awesome, 16 cores/32 thread CPU from AMD!
","

  First of all, kudos to AMD for making HEDT a lot more affordable for the masses. I bought the Threadripper 1950x on sale for $450. AMD's competitor sells a similar processor for a hefty $1,129! Threadripper gives you access to 16c/32t without costing an arm, leg and perhaps a kidney.Here are some of my thoughts regarding TR 1950x:a) The 16c/32t is awesome for multi-threaded programs. I use this mainly to crunch through numbers and gigabytes of data. It's simply awesome.b) You can easily disable half of the cores from 16 down to 8 cores using Ryzen Master. It's very useful when gaming since it reduces CPU latency, power consumption and temperature. Also, game engines can't efficiently use all those 32 threads. I also tend to do this when I'm doing tasks that does not require a lot of CPU computing power.c) Be prepared to cool this beast of a CPU. Remember, you are dealing with what's essentially 2 CPUs embedded within a single module. You need a 180W rated air or liquid cooler. In my case, I'm re-using my Eisbaer 240 from my Ryzen 1700 to cool this processor.c) Don't buy a Threadripper if you're only gaming. That's what the 6-core or 8-core Ryzen is for. Your money is better spent on a powerful gaming GPU. This thing is built mainly for multi-threaded professional workload in mind.d) The X399 motherboards can cost as much as the processor itself. You should consider this when building around a Threadripper.e) Plan your Threadripper build well since the motherboard layout varies. For example, the Zenith Extreme's 1st PCIE slot sits close to the DIMM slots and TR4 socket. Some coolers might block these slots.

Temps are great and temps on these cpu's read 27 degrees Celsius higher when using a reading of Tctl which motherboards and auto tuning utilities use.

These cpu's read higher on purpose to make sure the cpu fan is doing its job from what I have read.

  I have been using this CPU close to two months now and I am extremely impressed with it.Resource utilization is amazing, I don't even need to use game mode on the CPU because resource managment intelligently decided between using one CPU dye or the Other.in most cases for gaming 16 threads will be reserved entierly for gaming and the other 16 will be reserved entirely for background tasks. You likely wont see a game use all 32 thread for a couple years but something like assassins creed unity might do it at this moment.It uses all 32 threads for encoding/compressing/decompressing so your projects are lightning fast.I should note that I am using MSI's X399 pro carbon motherboard with this processor and that motherboard seems to be the best combo with this motherboard if you want stability. (I also have a review on that product with critical information in getting your system working properly, be sure to check it out)Noctua is the only cooler I would recommend with this processor. 99% of all liquid coolers and competing air coolers are relatively insufficient for this processor.warning: Do not get ram faster than 2666Mhz for this processor!

Failed torque wrench trashed TR4 socket (need new motherboard)
","

  No doubt, this will be a fine CPU, when I get a chance to use it some day. That will be a while.Prior to installing into the TR4 socket of my motherboard, I watched the installation video on AMD's web site, and 3 more on YouTube. It is essential to tighten the CPU into the socket with enough pressure that the connectors on the base of the CPU will make adequate contact with the pins in the socket, but to not tighten is so much that it bends those pins. For this reason, AMD supplies a torque wrench. The wrench failed, however,  resulting is disaster.I very carefully followed the procedure of tightening the 3 screws in order — or would have, given the chance. As I tightened the 1st screw slowly, I carefully listened for the tell-tale click of the torque wrench that would indicate maximum safe contact pressure had been attained. The wrench head was supposed to slip at this point, preventing additional torque. Only thing is, that click never came! Instead, the sound I heard was a disquieting scraping sound. After removal of the CPU and inspection of the socket, it was clear that the sound I had heard was hundreds of pins in the socket bending! Note that this didn't harm the CPU (so I can't request a replacement), but instead wrecked the motherboard. AMD's very limited warranty doesn't cover harm to other components resulting from the failure of their torque wrench.To make matters worse, the very carefully chosen motherboard had since gone out of stock everywhere, and it may be weeks before it is again available.

  CAUTION - THE INCLUDED SCREWDRIVER LIKE MANY OTHERS DID NOT RELEASE ON THE RIGHT TENSION!

I would recommend watching these so you don't overtighten as this can damage the motherboards socket or the CPU.The CPU:I have long since been an intel fanboy, but not anymore.Temperatures:  With a Noctua TR4 cooler, expect 23C-33C Idle with 40-48C under load.

At once.  You'll need lots of RAM if you want to do everything at once depending on what you do.  If you want to play a game, stream said game, render graphics to a file you should get no less than 32GB of 3600 MHz memory, most of these TR4 boards support up to 128GB RAM.If you do graphics work, video editing, rendering and still want a PC you can use to have fun; this is a great CPU.  I'll never get less than this in the future and it makes a quad core look like a toaster.Normal retail price is $800, it's been on sale often for $200, and moves up to $262 lately.  The boards are expensive generally around $250-$350, but well worth the cost to have up to 3 NVMEs, 8 DIMM slots and a high cap of 128GB RAM.10/10 Highly recommend, and would recommend further Threadripper CPUs they release.

  Fast and Affordable for 3D rendering workstation build.Using a Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3  air cooler, this awesome CPU set to 4.0ghz @1.35 on all 16 cores doesn't break 55c while rendering or mining 24/7!  This is better than most liquid coolers for Threadripper and much easier to manage.  I personally feel that liquid cooling for Threadripper is overrated, and this Noctua is performing great with minimal noise.

Impressive Performance at low cost!

  I use this CPU for level 1 virtualization on Linux. It does not disappoint.  It can handily divide the processing power between two virtual machineswith GPU passthrough. The price is still over $400 for a reason. The single core score (geekbench) is comparable to an intel 5820k, but with those extra cores,  you will not notice. The ryzen 1950x feels far more capable. My only gripe was that it is far more optimized on Linux than it is windows 10, the latency is definitely lower. This is still a powerful CPU in spite of its age. Make sure you match it with an excellent motherboard if you use it for GPU passthrough virtualization.

  I was supposed to get the Ryzen 7 7200X but then this saled at $200! That's 75% off of MSRP ($799). Who wouldn't jump on that deal!. I was happy I took this since I am not much of a gamer but rather is into 3D rendering, photography and lately venturing in videography. I know there's already the 3rd gen Threadrippers and this still the 1st gen but for my current workload, this is more than enough. If you chance upon another deal and this sale at $200 or less, don't think twice. Get it!

Running stable at 15% overclock
","

  First off: looks like a lot of people have been having issues with getting the wrong part in the box but mine was definitely a 1950X (make sure first thing you do when you get it is double-check). I built the system myself and had zero issues with installing/seating the chip, RAM compatibility, or POST errors. I ran the ASUS AI Suite once I had Windows install complete and it set system to 15% overclock (3.93 GHz) without me having to setup anything manually. Power draw and temp very consistent and no issues when running stress test or CineBench tests. So far so good!

  Threadrippers are in a category all their own.  No need for me to extol their virtues, those are highly publicized.  I'm swapping out all my server machines with the 12 core processors, these are game changers, at a bargain.  Doubled my server BW, while cutting server power nearly 40%.  Simultaneous 4k real time transcodes, never possible before, are now effortless.  Distributed encrypted filesystems, and best of all, I can saturate my 40G network backbone, with about 20% processor utilization.After a year, I'm still finding new, and exciting ways to leverage them into accelerating, and reducing cost, in our workflows..

  The experience opening this package was probably the best experience I've ever had.  You could almost feel the power as you in sealed the chamber and separated the chip from it's cradle.  The chip comes with a guide that allows for a fool proof placement of the chip.  Do not be afraid to give the chip a little elbow grease as you attempt to tighten the first screw.  There is a separate software called AMD ryzen master.  Be sure to get that if using this for gaming. I have found done games will immediately crash because they cannot work with so many cores.  The software allows you to put it into compatibility mode for gaming and then works like a dream.  Enjoy this beast.

  I purchased this processor along with an X399 Taichi MB.  Easiest build I ever experienced (over 50 builds in my career).  When I finished the build, I powered up with one DRAM stick to test posting.  When i did that, I had forgotten that I had left the Win-10 Pro USB stick in a jack from a prior build.  Not only did the board post, it loaded Win-10, and booted into Windows-10.  Simply amazing.  Performance is what you'd expect.  It's not the most nimble processor when lightly threaded, but when you run an app that wants to use threads, it is pretty amazing.

The motherboard went in the same case & used everything that was already there including the water cooler thanks to a bracket that AMD thoughtfully included with the ThreadRipper.  The ThreadRipper was scary with all its pins, but MSI had a YouTube video on how to install it & it went in just like they showed.

  Pros: cheap, stable at 4 GHz with 1.265V under load, can be cooled with air.Cons: motherboard prices. Low basic frequency for RAM.It's worth to mention that this thing in package is pretty heavy.Bought it with plan to later change for 2970/2990 while keeping the rest of system unchanged.Only thing that makes me a bit sad is that it doesn't want to work with my RAM on 3200 MHz with any timings. Currently running with 3066 MHz.Overall, it's good value/money, but most likely you won't want it unless you need a lot of PCI-E bandwith/lots of sata slots/quad channel memory/a lot of threads. Why? Because of price of x399 motherboards, and price of sufficient cooling system.Pro tip:make sure that your tasks supports multi-threading before buying it for them.

  I don't know whether it is just the one I received or whether all of the processors are like this, but I purchased around last year. And this CPU has been the worst investment I have ever made towards my video editing career. It works decently with vfx and 3d graphics applications and gaming is smooth as butter, but editing in premiere pro or after effects is a total nightmare. I can't seem to even edit a basic music video that is converted from 4k to 1080p.

  This was my first AMD processor.  Built it a few months ago, and so far, so good.  I went with this processor for video editing mainly.  However, I do like to game as well and I have not noticed any lack of performance in my games with this processor.  I haven't bench marked it, but I don't really care too much about red line bench mark numbers.  As long as I don't notice any lack of performance, then its good for me, and there's been no noticeable performance lag when playing games (FarCry 4, Crysis II, MGS, to name a few).  I do agree with others though that the packaging of this processor was rather obnoxious.  Quality packaging, but too over the top nonetheless.

Had issues, ended up with 1950X, long story!
","

  Had issues getting the 1920X to recognize all 128GB from memory kits on the QVL, ended up returning Dominator Platinum CMD128GX4M8A2666C15 and got Vengeance LPX CMK128GX4M8A2400C14 (price went up about $100 but ended up with slower memory), that didn't fix the problem. Returning the 1920X for 1950X (priced ended up dropping about $200, net ~$100 ""saved"" but wasted over a month of time) so ended up with slower memory, but more cores and working system. The Dominator series passed (when any 4 of 8 installed, 64GB) the RowHammer test (potential issue with ALL DDR4 or DDR3 RAM) where as the Vengeance 128GB passed all test but has thrown a RowHammer error once so far (possibly able to flip bits and cause corruption with malicious code).Swapped the Motherboard initially because it could of been bad board, in doing so found out that the original motherboard had issues with Active State Power Mangement (PCIe thing) which had to be disabled on one board. Kept the replacement board, replaced the CPU and the RAM (not necessary, but the Vengence was on Corsairs website as X399 compatible where Dominator memory was only on QVL list and most likely tested against 1950X only).In the end, enthusiasts like myself would most likely be getting 1950X anyways, which would have been tested for fewer defects and not resold (cores disabled) as 1920X and thus leading to all the memory (8 slots full 128GB) issues. *IF* you are going with less memory w/ 1920X/1900X...

  This is an outrageous product for an outrageous price. If you need a server, or a crunch machine, or a video editing machine, this will be the go-to affordable product in a home studio with a budget. READ THE INSTALL DIRECTIONS AND WATCH THE INSTALL VIDEOS because if no homework/research is done, one can mess up the motherboard pins and possibly risk damage to the processor as well. I have built many systems over the years as hobbies. It was actually reasonably easy for me. I read the directions and watched the videos. My old AMD 990FX motherboard and 8350 black processor actually games better than this chip.

Great CPU, with some platform problems and a lot of heat
","

  It is a great cpu, with huge potential to last for years, which is highly unusual in a field where obsolescence is normal at the 18 months mark. Its problems seem more platform based as the x399 chipset in the motherboards has yet to be improved, and I mean by a lot, and -of course- it is the heat problem. You have to keep in mind this is a 180w cpu that will reach its threshold temperature very fast if you don't have the proper cooling, and even in that case. I think we still have to see how it will behave in mid summer... so, liquid cooling all the way, and probably custom loop if you are going to overclock. In summary, excellent CPU for apps even yet to come and gaming, but be careful with its requirements.

  This thing is a BEAST. I use this to render in V-RAY (32 threads, oh yeah) but also for ZBrush, Star Citizen, video editing, etc. The thing just rips through everything, but it really shines for rendering. I cool this with a Noctua fan. Also, I leave it in Creator Mode all of the time and still get 20-24 FPS in Star Citizen (which is alpha, not yet optimized and doesn't offer massive framerates like most games yet). I get no real benefit in Star Citizen in Game Mode, at least, not enough to make it worth a reboot (which is quick for Windows 10 on M.2 anyway).The thing is amazing, and as more games and apps take advantage of more threads you're gonna be future-proof. If you're a 3D dev like me you can use it for all of your apps which make full use of the power of the Threadripper 1950x!

  This is a niche CPU. For most applications, proceed to an Intel 8700K. The least expensive Threadripper has the same core/thread count as some of it's Ryzen cousins, and similar speeds. Why pay extra for this? Well, with TR architecture you get quad channel RAM, which means something for certain heavy applications, and you get 64 PCIe lanes, which is essential if you are running a RAID card and 2 GPUs, plus an M.2 drive and God only knows what else if you are building a TR desktop.What I found exceptionally good with this CPU is cooling. Running a constant 4.13 GHz overclock and a EVGA CLC 280 cooler it runs 46C to 48C under a heavy load. I rendered a 3D map from minecraft into a single 3d image and this took all 16 threads to 99%, and yet, the 1900X stayed cool and the fans on the radiator remained almost silent. Considering that my cooler is round and thus does not perfectly cover the CPU, this is amazing performance. I think this stems from the CPU being so huge, and having so many pins, so much space across which to deliver heat.People say ""don't use this for games"" because they know you can get more value with a consumer CPU. However, that does not mean that if you want this CPU for some other need, that it won't run games. It's a 4.1 GHz CPU. It can and does max out DOTA2, PUBG, World of Warships, DOOM 2016, and most interestingly: heavily modified Minecraft. I have a Forge/Optifine/SEUS setup and it's very impressive what an impact a CPU of this kind can do. I still say an 8700K would best it in all of these, right up until you run video encoding or 3d modeling.A word about SLI: I am running 2 GTX 970s which came from a scrapped computer and have had no issues with any software whatsoever. Many others have but in my case its been a boon to not have to buy a GPU, take advantage of the PCIe lanes in TR4, and still have excellent graphics performance.I give the 1900X 4/5 because for most purposes there are better bang for buck CPUs, but otherwise it's simply fantastic.EDIT: I have added photos of the Threadripper in action, which demonstrate how it uses threads, in a few interesting applications.

AMD Threadripper - It wont mow your lawn, but it can do much more than that!
","

  As a processor, the AMD Threadripper 1950X is AMD's flagship prosumer processor, designed for users who are multi/mega-tasking, have specialized workloads that can take advantage of the many cores high end processors offer. On paper, it has near feature parity with similar Intel processors with potentially a lot more cores for a lot less money. So, really the question we all want to know is.... How is it?In practice its great for my workloads. I fit the ""Megatasker"" profile as well as have some programs that I frequently use that scale well with many cores. So trans-coding video via x265, while testing virtual machines for work, while controlling home automation, web browsing, and some gaming on the side make for a buttery smooth experience no matter what I throw at the system.Its good points:---  Many many many cores taunt you to find workloads it cant handle.--- The ability to run ECC (Error correction Code) memory adds a level of system stability formerly only available in server class processors.--- Having so many PCI-E lanes that you don't need to worry about starving your networking, storage or graphics devices regardless of configuration.--- Performance per $ that can outstrip the competition in relevant workloads.--- Soldered IHS. It might seem a stretch to list this, but from investigations into thermal performance vs power consumption this can play a very big difference in why AMD can seemingly push more cores at faster clocks. They have an effective way of transferring waste heat from cores to IHS to the HSF/Cooler. AKA: They didn't cheap out on the thermal packaging - The enthusiast crowd thanks you, AMD.Its neutral points:--- This isnt the CPU for you if you are a casual user, a hard core gamer, or are not  sure if your workloads would benefit from a >4 Core CPU.--- The AMD (Ry)zen architecture is fairly new, so there are optimizations that are taking place so meet these new processors - this simply means that what you read about performance today will improve over time - all things considered. It isn't something that is a guarantee for every application, but nor is it a bad thing. When Zen first came out overclockers had a rough time with memory compatibility at stock speeds - now we have memory compatibility up to DDR4-3600 - things like this are expected to improve as well as software improvements. Again they are not guarantees so as to put this as a positive, but performance of these processors will grow a little bit over time as the ecosystem and programmers learn to optimize for it..--- Power hungry. Of course a HEDT processor will pull a lot of power. It isnt good or bad, it is what it is. Just ensure your power supply, case and cooling system are appropriately sized for the thermals. Overclocking (if that's your thing) is a different story... See below:The Bad Points:--- Single threaded performance will trail comparable Intel processors - Intel still has a 10-15% advantage in IPC (but you arent buying this processor for single threaded workloads are you?)--- Lacking AVX512 support (yes, AVX-512 is a mess right now with many  (Partial) implementations and very little software that uses it to advantage - if you have such software, why are you looking at this, then? ;) )--- The 1950X is pushing its own thermal envelopes at stock speeds with rational cooling. 16 Cores at 3.4-4.2 Ghz is really impressive - but sometimes the 1950X's little brother the 1920X (the 12 Core Threadripper) manages better thermals, better clocks (Less thermal throttling), and higher performance in some workloads.This seems to demonstrate that the 1950X wont have a lot of headroom for rational overclocking taken as a whole, and the need to size any threadripper system for abundant cooling- doing so will prevent thermal issues from such a high powered processor.. When we do overclock we see power consumption go through the roof - even when simply raising Memory frequencies can add an additional 30W of power consumption. If you are an overclocker and this is your hobby - there is a challenge here for you - bring a big power supply, and a lot of cooling.Overall - Threadripper is a great ""Halo"" product from AMD that likely isnt for the majority of people out there - but it is an excellent choice for those who have a workload that matches its strengths. It also seems to be helping anyone who has noticed the stagnation of x86/x64 platform stagnation - Intel is now on high alert, and we see 6-core consumer chips imminent, price reductions for Intel HEDT processors, and this will only benifit us all in the long run.

AMD is back and glad I waited to get the RIPPER!
","

  I had this preordered and got it in the morning.I already had all my other parts set up and only needed my Threadripper.Coming from an extreme edition Intel CPU from about two years ago, Threadripper was a huge upgrade. I work at home and I really prefer having only one PC to handle both personal and workstation needs. Gaming performance was an upgrade and my workstation renders and processing was cut only in half.I was going to upgrade earlier in the year to an Intel CPU but after watching Ryzen, it made a lot of sense to wait for Threadripper. It was well worth it. AMD has done a bang up job with the architecture and even if you don't need such a power multitasking CPU, AMD competition will help drive CPU prices back down.After all these years, AMD is BACK!...

Mult-core speeds = fantastic!  //  Single-core speeds = meh.
","

  I can't give this thing 5 stars based solely on the fact that it is slower than the Intel 7820 processor I just swapped this out for, in pretty much all Adobe apps.  However, I do a lot of Physical rendering in Cinema 4D and for that this processor shreds nearly twice as fast.In short: multi-thread on this beast = amazing, single core lacks something to be desired vs. Intel.  Honestly I was not expecting Photoshop and After Effects to get slower, but they are.  It's not a massive difference, but it is enough for me to feel it.I'll keep pushing this thing to its limits and report back if these feelings change.(Also note: the only reason I returned the Intel 7820 is because my Adobe products were crashing randomly and I couldn't find a fix. I noticed that others had the same issue. No one seemed to have any problems with the AMD so I decided to make the switch.  No more crashes, so that's a plus.)

Don't get the 1900X
","

  Unfortunately, I can't review each one individually, as they're all aggregated into one score,For all Threadripper products, it's recommended you do some research, but to get you started you absolutely must get the AMD Ryzen master software so you can control the processor at a more granular level. This CPU series has some quirks with how the dies communicate over the infinity fabric, and depending on your application, you'll want to set Localized or Distributed Memory Control. With that said here's my thoughts on each of the CPUs. Most importantly, these are Workstation CPUs and all Threadrippers give you 64 PCIE lanes (useful for things like NVME storage and tons of Graphics cards) and Quad Channel Memory (Extremely useful for bandwidth-starved applications) these aren't gaming CPUs, and you can get comparable (Or better, we'll get into that) performance for a faction of the cost.16 Core part 1950X 5/5 - Phenomenal. Best Value for Performance a workstation can get. Intel's massive Skylake X's will outperform these, but at over 50% of the cost, and with all the quirks the X299 platform has. It'll be up to you if you can overcome the initial investment overhead of a Skylake X in added productivity or not. That decision I leave to you gentle reader.12 Core Part 1920X 4.5/5 - Great, but, for certain applications, (Gaming especially) You're looking at performance in line with something akin to a 1600X at best unless the quad channel memory comes into play (Fallout 4 is a good example of this happening). These aren't gaming processors, but they're particularly ill suited for gaming because of the CCX and die interconnect structure introducing latency, which is where the Local Memory Mode comes into play, but doing that isolates your application to one Die (Two CCXs) which reduces latency significantly but also removes 6 cores and 12 threads from the scheduler.8Core Part 1900X 1.5/5 - AVOID. A dramatic misstep by AMD, this CPU can strangle your PC. With performance not even meeting 1600x Standards because this particular Threadripper is a (2+0, 2+0) x (2+0, 2+0) CCX and die  structure [For reference, the 1700/X and 1800X have (2+2) x (2+2) so there is no die-interconnect latency for its 8 cores] , there's considerable latency introduced to get 8 cores running. And if you run in Local Memory mode, you've effectively got a sub-par quad core with overkill PCIE lanes and Quad Channel Memory. Save your pennies and get at least the 1920X.

It seems to me that they might have been rushed to market without rigorous testing.

I'm returning it plus the two motherboards I tried and reverting back to my ""old"" i7.

This is an excellent productivity chip capable of perfectly great gaming performance
","

  This is an excellent productivity chip capable of perfectly great gaming performance, where you don't really need to make compromises between being able to game or do single-threaded limited tasks while also being able to shred productivity tasks.Performance (Single threaded):it's rather good, though certainly not the literal best. However, this doesn't actually matter that much in games: there is a barely perceptible difference if you have a 1080ti and are trying to drive as many frames as possible through a 144hz free/g-sync display (and above 144hz you dont really notice). At 4K which I use primarily, its pushing enough frames that the game becomes gpu bound, so the i9 or 7700k has no advantages here.Performance (Multi threaded):threadripper absolutely shines here, in both synthetic benchmarks and real life workloads:In CB15, I was able to get 3019 stock (CB doesn't seem to be affected much by memory). With a modest OC (3.8ghz), I was hitting 3364In blender, I was able to use cycles in viewports with no perceptible difference to CUDA acceleration using 2x 1080tis. I was also able to use cycles in final rendering at around 3x the speed of 2x 1080tis, which is really impressive, especially due to better than 100% scaling vs my R7 1800X (ram speed might have been a factor - the R7 had ram at 2800MTs, but threadripper managed to get the ram stable at 3466MTs). (2x 1080ti's took 6.2 minutes, threadripper took just 2.1 minutes. The R7 1600X took 6.3 minutes)In a text data analysis workload form work, threadripper was able to complete analysis of one batch of transcripts in just under 4 minutes, vs. 9 minutes for a ryzen 7 1800X and 20 minutes for an i7 4770.Power & Cooling:The CPU stays inside its TDP under even the heaviest workloads I was throwing at it at its stock clocks, (it hit 179W though, according to HWmonitor). When OCing through, you can easily push it beyond while still managing to cool it, thanks to its soldered IHS (unlike intel...), and I'm using an old aio which manages to cool it surprisingly well. Hoping to get one of the new TR4 specific aios.PCIe Lanes:Got 2x Samsung EVOs and a PRO in my system, alongside 2x 1080tis in x16 each, in addition to a 10Gbe card in 4x mode, with room for even more stuff.

Not for Linear Algebra and Scientific Computing, yet
","

  I'm a computer scientist with proper training on both theoretical machine learning, computer architecture and parallel processing.Let's talk about the good things first before 'but'. It's safe to skip the first section if you are attracted purely by the title of this review.1. Good things: (Boring, you all know Threadripper is good.)We constructed this experimental server for machine learning specific development. 1950x + MSI X299 + DDR4-2666 128G + Quad GPU + multiple fast M.2. Installing the system Ubuntu 16.04.4 was fairly easy. I have to fix a few things in the kernel, no big deal. 1950x has 64 PCIe lanes, enough to handle 4 GPUs (16+16+8+8 = 48 lanes), 3 M.2 SSD (4+4+4 = 12 lanes). The whole system is fast without a doubt. ECC memory support, great, almost overkill. I did some generic CPU benchmark initially, the score is almost 2x compared to Ryzen 1700. It's not surprising since 1950x is practically 2 1800x connected by high speed switch.2. But,when it comes to linear algebra, things are quite bad. Since we constructed this server specifically for machine learning and tensor processing, this machine is almost unusable. To be specific, we use python, PyTorch, CuPy etc. I benchmarked the numpy and PyTorch CPU performance on 1950x and got shocked it was much slower than i7-6700K in almost every way. Certainly for numpy, the problem may come from the pre-integrated MKL BLAS library (Anaconda uses MKL by default). Alright, I can compile openBLAS and numpy from the source code, which is tiring in general, but I'm just curious if I can fix the things easily. After I compiled these and benchmark again, thing became much better for BLAS, LAPACK performance is still bad. To be specific, for matrix multiplication, below size 10Kx10K, i7 is faster. Beyond this size, 1950x-16 threads (vs 4 threads on i7) wins by up to 200%, which may comes from the doubled memory bandwidth since i7-6700k only is dual-channel rather than quad-channel. For a more detailed benchmark discussion, please Google 'performance on AMD Ryzen and Threadripper', you will see my detailed numerical reports on Github openBLAS repository. Then I compiled numpy with BLIS (AMD official BLAS library), its performance was abysmal to a level I'm sure I compiled it in a dumb way. For another discussion to understand the situation better, please Google 'Threadripper 1950x slow with Anaconda Numpy'.These are just for numpy, still not quite working. Down the road, in order to make all of our tool chains work, I will have to compile PyTorch, Magma?, Scipy, CuPy if not more ... I can not affort to do all of these, so I bought an i9-7960x platform instead. I don't think other AI and data scientists developers will have the patience to tune these either. You may wonder why I don't put all the linear algebra on the GPU, the answers are several folds. First, some times you need a quick prototyping. Second, like PyTorch using Magma, SVD stuffs are using both CPU and GPUs. CPU easily becomes a bottleneck with such a performance. Third, I understand 1950x has lower single thread performance, uses slower memory, if the linear algebra is also slow, it's really not the machine for our purpose. Please remember, this is a very special purpose.3. ConclusionI think I will really like Threadripper if I'm not using it to do linear algebra. The software eco-system is not there for scientific computing yet. If you need to use CPU to do any linear algebra and tensor processing, Threadripper is not ready. You should just go and buy an Intel platform, like dual Xeon or i9-7960x.4. Misc (Important) and Subjective Opinion:Finally I have to emphasis again Threadripper is a great CPU in general! I would like to give it 5 stars. It's super fast, power efficient and cost effective. I shouldn't give it '3 stars' just because it doesn't yet do linear algebra well. However, I would like to draw attention to this specific problem so that it will be addressed and the scientific community will benefit more from AMD's product in the future! This review is only for linear algebra and scientific computing.If you are doing video editing, recording, streaming, gaming, etc, the opinion in this review is not applicable to your application at all. Threadripper has a really good spec and concept. Though this experimental system was not successful, I hope the software can catch up soon and then we will be happy to try again.

Threadripper is a tank!!!

  Although Amazon screwed me on my pre-order for this CPU and the motherboard I wanted, I was able to get it on release day from another popular computer vendor.Pros:-Easy Install-Super fast with tasks like rendering video in Vegas and multi tasking-Can multi task better then any other CPU I have ever used.-In a test I did, I went into Extra Param settings on XSplit broadcaster for Twitch, and under encoder present, I selected 'slow' and started streaming with it while gaming. Threadripper zipped right through it without issues.-NOTE ON INSTALL: For those who have had issues with the 1-2-3 screw tightening on the TR4 boards when installing this CPU -Don't tighten the first screw all the way down. Tightening it down all the way will push the bracket towards that screw, raising the back end of the bracket where screws 2 and 3 are. This makes it hard to get the threads on screws 2 and 3 to catch. Start all three screws slightly so the threads catch, and then tighten screw one all the way down, then 2, then 3.Cons:-Not many full IHS coverage coolers yet-Does run a little warm on idle with current AIO coolers. I am running the NZXT Kraken x62 and my idel temps run between 31c and 33c depending on ambient temps. When doing full loads with video rendering or running Prime95, I have been getting 63c to 65c with the Kraken cooler in 'Performance' mode. These are acceptable temps, but I imagine with a AIO cooler that had a full IHS coverage for this cpu, they would be much better.Other Thoughts:VIDEO RENDERING: This CPU is a monster. I have been doing a lot of multi tasking test with it since I have installed it. I recently had an Intel 6800k and did some video rendering test with it before installing Threadripper. I had a 30 minuet full HD video (60fps @50mbps) on the timeline, with some color grading, cross fade transitions, and Waves audio plugins on the master bus. The 6800k rendered the video in 1hr and 14 mins, where Threadripper took it down in 51 minuets.With the 6800k, I would be limited on what I could while rendering,. I might be able to get away with web browsing if I was lucky. With Threadripper I am browsing the net with 5 to 6 tabs open in Chrome, using the Windows Netflix app, and checking email at the same time, and I still am using only 78% of the cpu.GAMING: Many people have stated this is 'slower' or 'not as good as Intel' chips for gaming. That is correct. This CPU was never fully geared towards gaming. It is for high end desk top users who have heavy tasks that require a lot of power or multi-tasking users. However, having said that, I have been able to game with this CPU just fin eon my particular setup. I am not a 'hardcore' gamer where the 3 fps a second I might get with my GPU overclock matter. I am running an LG Ultra Wide production monitor with a 60Hrz refresh rate. I have had no issues running games like GTA V, Hitman or Rocket League, at the 60fps mark I want with this monitor. So gaming is possible with this cpu, it's just not going to give you the higher numbers other smaller CPUs can. This is because games do not scale well across a large number of cores.

Amazingly Fast CPU

  Note, I purchased this from a local store, not Amazon, but worthwhile reviewing either way for those who find it helpful.I upgraded from an i7-4790K (Devil's Canyon) and the difference is just night and day! I've always been an AMD fan but unfortunately nothing really caught my attention from their lineup in recent years except maybe the FX-8350 which I had prior to the i7, and then this line of products came out.I'm not much of a gamer so my review is not based on gaming performance though I can say that for the times that I do play, everything is smooth. I mainly use this as my professional workstation, for some pretty intense multitasking, including running virtual machines, SQL and MySQL databases, and as of late quite a bit of CPU driven data processing and machine learning development with H2O.Ai and other frameworks (both CPU and GPU).The very first, and probably most important thing for me was availability of PCIe lanes. On Intel's comparable products you get x16 lanes, x20 if you're lucky and for an extremely heft price tag maybe x40-x44 on the top of the line i9's. With this 1950x you get x64 right off the bat. Why is this important? If you're using multiple GPUs like I am, and was on the i7, the GPUs alone eat up most if not all of the PCIe lanes, so forget about putting a high end NVMe on the system and expecting it to perform at full speed.As an example, on the i7 I had x16 lanes, 2 GPUs and 1 Samsung 970 Pro NVMe. The GPUs consumed all PCIe lanes leaving the NVMe competing for bandwidth with other peripherals and SATA drives and instead of performing at advertised speeds of ~3200/2400 MB/s (or whatever those are) it was maybe pushing 800 MB/s... A ridiculously low fraction of the speed I should have been getting.Now I can confidently expand my storage through other available M.2 ports or AIC PCIe cards without having to worry about bandwidth.Running multiple CPU intensive VMs is a breeze, and no longer need to stop my databases when running other intensive tasks, it just works, and always smooth.One minor, but important con to mention here is on overclocking. Coming from Intel, I'm used to just clicking a button to enable Turbo Boost and not having to worry really about overclocking with specific voltage settings, etc. You won't have the same option with this CPU, and while I understand there's some sort of automatic boost going on with a few cores that bring this CPU up to the advertised boost speeds, it's not as straightforward as Intel with their Turbo Boost technology.With that said, you'll have to really learn using Ryzen Master to overclock your CPU properly and with stability. I personally can't seem to OC to the advertised boost speed of 4.0 without having to worry about thermal issues, as any settings I've found that make it run stable at 4.0 also make the processor run past the 68c max operating temperature. I can run it comfortably at 3.7 with no issues, but anything after that starts causing heat problems so plan on buying a pretty good liquid cooling solution if you want to push it to boost speeds on all cores.

This chip is a beast.
","

  Let me start off by saying that I am not an AMD fanboy, and I have been using Intel CPU's for the past 14 years. Starting with a Pentium 4 3.4Ghz CPU. My previous CPU before ThreadRipper was an Intel 4930k(6 Cores/12 Threads). I had been running that for 5 years, and it was time to upgrade.I knew that AMD was coming out with the ThreadRipper, and I knew that Intel was coming out with the i9 to compete. I am glad I went with the ThreadRipper. Not only is it half the cost as the Intel 7980XE, which only gives you an extra 2 Cores/4 Threads, it is only faster by about 20-25%, and has 20 less PCIe lanes. So, you are essentially paying for the Intel name in my opinion.This chip is fast, I'm very excited that AMD has finally released something to compete with Intel, and with Ryzen I believe they have.Specs:CPU: 1950xMotherboard: Gigabyte X399RAM: 32GB G SkillGPU: GTX 1080CPU Cooler: EKWB ThreadRipper SupremacyGPU Cooler: EKWB GTX 1080 BlockRadiator: XSPC RX360Temperature for CPU at idle is around 30c, and under load is about 50c. I don't do any overclocking, and I don't intend too at this time. If I do any, I will post the results here.Compared to my Intel 4930k, the Threadripper is about 70% faster. Although it does pull more power, which is expected as it has 10 more cores!I am very happy with this purchase, and I am excited to see a CPU war between Intel and AMD again, as that is where we will start seeing more advancements again. As this past decade has done very little in terms of advancement due to the CPU market not having any competition.

  This makes the i9 9900K obsolete on arrival.  Not only do you get 12 cores and 24 threads with AMD for approximately the same cost, but you get a solid upgrade path towards the entire Threadripper lineup well into 7nm 2020. Even if you buy used processors down the line to maintain the edge, this platform gives you tremendous value and longevity! The only reason you would consider an i9 intel is if you love to game at 1080p at 300fps instead of 250fps lol, aside from that there is no comparison in performance and value and longevity. When you mount the processor into the socket, remember that you have to torque in relatively tight, that's the only thing i learned the hard way.

  I don't believe in upgrading frequently. In fact, I only build a computer every ten years,  sooner only if something catastrophic happens in between. That said I'm building my new computer after using a Phenom 1090T. I got the Threadripper 1920x because it's exactly what I need for a long haul system: 12 cores are way more than enough for the time being, 64 PCIE lanes can handle any upgrade I can think of, and up to 128gb of ram, I can say for sure that I won't even use half of that. My purpose is for a CAD workstation and general engineering work: CFD, FEA etc... Haha. This chip at this price allows for a very economical system, not only for my workload but for future proofing as well. Well done AMD! 👌

Intel Fanboys who create fake reviews
","

  Like all Intel Fanboys who create fake reviews, the one that is NOT a verified buyer who states ""Bad gaming performance. Runs hot. The most power hungry consumer processor in the world."" are half truths.  This review is to counter that fake one.1. Is it bad for gaming performance?  It's not bad.  It's not great.  It's good.  It's about on par with the Ryzen 7 series.  Remember, the Threadripper allows you to destroy everything else AND still be good at games.  If all you care about is getting 10-20 more FPS in games and NOTHING ELSE, and want to spend A LOT of money buying Intel products so that you have no competition to create lower prices, by all means, keep paying Intel, fanboys.  If it weren't for AMD, Intel would only release CPUs (like it has always) that increase only 7% performance per year.  The 7th generation i7 CPU is only 7% faster than the 6th generation i7 CPU.Don't forget Intel's illegal shenanigans it pulled a few years back by bullying computer manufacturers into only buying Intel.  Intel truly is an evil corporation.  The U.S. sued Intel and forced Intel to pay $1 billion in damages to AMD (which is not nearly enough for the pain and suffering and lost revenue and profit that could have been).  The EU also sued Intel, but Intel's deep pocket is postponing the EU courts from doing anything.  Seriously?  You make tens of billions a year, you illegally cheated to become the top player, and $1 billion EU penalty you won't pay?  Keep supporting this company, Intel fanboys.2. Does it run hot?  Not even.  If you look at online reviews, the i9 7900X is the one that runs hot, by as much as 20 degrees.  Want to know something else funny?  Read the VERIFIED Newegg and Amazon reviews and you'll also see the i7 7700k runs hot too lol.  There's something called Google and the Internet.  Use it.3. Does it use more power?  Sure, but not by much.  Again, use the Internet.  You have no excuse for being ignorant in this day and age.By the way, Threadripper completely sold out in the United States and Canada after ONE DAY OF SALES.  Can you say that of Intel processors?  hahaWhat's that?  You're going to buy the i9 7980XE for $2 grand?  Early reports suggest Intel is panicking and released them early, without properly fixing all the bugs.  Good luck.  You better hope you test it out early and refund it.  With the $1 grand savings, you could have bought AMD stock and gained enough money to buy multiple Threadrippers.

  If you run the kind of workloads that can scale to this many processors there is nothing better for the price. I overclocked mine to a stable 3.9 GHz with an NZXT watercooler and 1.3v core, and I could definitely go higher with a better cooler.Be warned though! This chip can be a nightmare to socket correctly into a motherboard. I've built many computers and it still took me four tries before I could POST correctly. So before you think you have a defective one keep trying! I also highly recommend NOT attaching the cooler until you can POST for this reason. Just be careful and power off quick after each try.

  Had issues getting the 1920X to recognize all 128GB from memory kits on the QVL, ended up returning Dominator Platinum CMD128GX4M8A2666C15 and got Vengeance LPX CMK128GX4M8A2400C14 (price went up about $100 but ended up with slower memory), that didn't fix the problem. Returning the 1920X for 1950X (priced ended up dropping about $200, net ~$100 ""saved"" but wasted over a month of time) so ended up with slower memory, but more cores and working system. The Dominator series passed (when any 4 of 8 installed, 64GB) the RowHammer test (potential issue with ALL DDR4 or DDR3 RAM) where as the Vengeance 128GB passed all test but has thrown a RowHammer error once so far (possibly able to flip bits and cause corruption with malicious code).Swapped the Motherboard initially because it could of been bad board, in doing so found out that the original motherboard had issues with Active State Power Mangement (PCIe thing) which had to be disabled on one board. Kept the replacement board, replaced the CPU and the RAM (not necessary, but the Vengence was on Corsairs website as X399 compatible where Dominator memory was only on QVL list and most likely tested against 1950X only).

All ANN work is done through a GPU but large amounts of ram is required because the software needs fast cache for episodic memory storage, searching and retriaval. The price point for more than 4 cores is still pretty high. Soo...I decided to build a HAL from used parts, with the exception of the motherboard, drives, and powers supply. I was able to get E5 2670 V2 pair for $300 bucks and 128GB of ram for $300! The server has one Vega 56 8 GB GPU, a Samsung 960 Pro 256 SSD and a 4 TB drive. All together including the case and power supplly was about $1700.  Also note that the memory capacity for this rig can reach 1 TB of ram.So while AMD is a great price point for what it does, the used after market hardware is really the only affordable route for the AI enthusiast...

","

  The Threadripper is a beast of a processor that is perfect for high end home workstations, home servers, etc with plenty of Cores, PCIe lanes, and RAM capacity to go around. Unfortunately, the Threadripper X399 platform is currently plagued by PCIe bus issues. Common PCIe cards like the Inateck 7 port USB Expansion card recommended by Oculus are misconfigured by the firmware and cause the system to fail to post (other brands have been confirmed to have the same issue). PCI passthrough is completely broken; GPUs get stuck in D3 state. IOMMU fails to fully isolate all slots correctly. These issues are confirmed cross-motherboard in various threads online. AMD has not acknowledged filed support tickets or AMD Community forum posts about this issue thus far. Extremely disappointing since the original Ryzen hit these same issues. While they were later fixed by the AGESA 1006 update, we are now in the ironic situation where the high-end virtualization features work on the cheap consumer parts and are broken on the high-end X399 parts. For an asking price of $999 this is not acceptable. Hoping AMD fixes these issues soon, as the Threadripper is otherwise an amazing processor. « less
