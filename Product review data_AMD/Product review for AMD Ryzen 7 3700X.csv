Fantastic chip, outperforms the $489 i9 9900k in productivity.
","

  This chip is a beast! Was able to snag mine from 'AMD authorized reseller'. Came in 1 day when it was estimated to take 3. This thing blows everything out of the water at this price point. On par with the intel 9700k in gaming for $70 less, and better than the $489 i9 9900k in productivity and multitasking. First time buying an AMD chip but with their recent innovations its hard to justify buying Intel.

No point in buying a 3800x
","

  TL;DR:  Really good and stable processor for all around workloads and gaming.  Still has a good stock stable boost clock of about 4.2GHz with a good cooler about the same as the 3800x without the extra $$$.  Be care full of the Motherboard you buy as it may be troublesome updating the bios on x470 and lower boards to support the 3rd generation of AMD Processors.Full Read:For gaming I see this baby stay stable clocks at 4291-4316MHz and sporadic single core turbos up to 4392MHz.  The 4.2 ghz all core stable boost clock is about the same as a 3800x (according to other reviewers) but the 3800x has a bit more of a higher single core sporadic burst, but probably not worth the additional $70 for the tiny performance difference. I have a Phanteks PH-TC14PE (nh-d15 comparable) and during a 30 minute Aida 64 stress test (picture) the 3700x stays at 85c and 4070MHz average.This processor is paired with a 570x Aorus elite so I wouldn't have the trouble of doing tons of CPU swapping on a b450 or an x470 board to update the bios (plus I saved $70 over the 3800x). Some of  those boards have quick flash capabilities, but if they don't then it is just time consuming and a bit painful to install an old 2nd or 1st gen cpu, update, then reinstall the new processor and make sure it actually works.  Also as of 5/20/19 a bunch of Ryzen 3xxx out of the box compatible B450 boards are announced, but nobody knows when.I did a motherboard & CPU Swap in my system and had a lag filled windows experience, so a windows reinstall was necessary to get it to run smoothly (your actual experience may vary).  After the reinstall it's been nothing but buttery smooth.

It needs some tweaking
","

  I'm happy to see that it's finally in stock at MSRP. I got the 3700x to replace a 6700k system which broke. The ASUS GENE VIII motherboard failed. So it was time for an upgrade and go back to AMD. Last AMD part I had was the AMD FX-8350 back in 2012. The 3700x seems to work just fine, cinebench 15 score when from 850 to 2145, so that's a thing.Edit: 7/30/2019I'm docking 2 stars. The chip is great and all, but it runs too hot at idle, 40+ C on an aio, 24 C ambient.I'm comfortable having my pc run hot during games, etc.., but not at idle.At idle the system keeps boosting to 4.2+ Ghz all the time.It's like it doesn't know how to clock itself down (even on AMD balanced profile, latest Win 10 1903).Disabling boost solves the temp issue, but that's not an option.This is probably the early adopter tax and I hope they fix it in the bios.It could also be the ASUS board which is too aggressive with voltages.Edit: 7/31/2019+1 star, Windows power saver power plan is what I wanted.Idles at 32 C at 25 C ambient, core voltage a 0.944 V instead of that crazy 1.45+ VI does sacrifice some standby performance, but that's ok.Edit: 9/16/2019+1 star, the ABBA bios update fixed my idle power problem.It just needed some tweaking.

Amazing CPU!
","

  This CPU made a huge difference in gaming coming from a R5 1600 OC 3.8ghz. There is absolutely no reason to overclock as it boosts itself as much as it can. Hit 4250mhz all core on BF V on a Gigabyte AX-370 Gaming K5 with BIOS update (while the new board is in shipping). With a Corsair H100i v2 max temp under full load was 80c, normally around 65c in demanding games. FPS in games went up by roughly 30 letting my 2070 hit 144 consistently with 0 dips.

Affordable Intel-Killer!
","

  Not only does this CPU absolutely blow Intel's current line-up out of the water, it also has the product quality to show for it. I never thought I'd hear myself say it but I'm a firm believer in AMD and what the Zen chips are accomplishing here after seeing it for myself. This CPU is currently tackling Star Citizen on one front and streaming on the other end, all while unzipping some files and keeping up with everything else that demands it. Not only is it running fairly well it's also keeping stable temperature wise. Under full load the temps average at around 65c-70c and that's just running the stock Wraith Prism cooler.Definitely eager to test out this chip with a water cooler slapped onto it and a slight OC to kick it into high-gear. All in all I really can't complain for what I've received. It's an affordable processor that'll do just about anything for you without much trouble and still have room for more. Don't worry about paying ""premium"" pricing for ""top of the line"" and ""state of the art"" CPUs when you can get all of that here for less, with more!

New Build not a Value
","

  If you are upgrading an old build this may be fine but when building a new computer the latest x570 chipset is buggy and the x470 chipset motherboards ship with older bios that require an update to use this cpu.  The time and cost to take a cpu from an existing computer is also going to eat up any perceived value in these brand new chips that only work in the buggy new motherboards. Very few x470 motherboards support the bios update without a cpu - Asus has ONE.  I made the mistake of reading some stories that downplayed the issue and assumed that I could work around it.  Stupid me - don't be stupid too.  Who keeps a new CPU lying around?

  i'm coming from 3770k OCed to 4.5 Ghz, before that i had Q6600 also Oced, last AMD cpu i owned was back in 2003 when AMD Athlon x64 was the king.fast forward 15 years, AMD IS BACK!!!you would be a no brainer to buy intel when you have such a great CPU from AMD, this crushes everything i throw at it and it costs 40% less than the i9 9900k.some folks might argue that Intel still has the lead in gaming, well i game at 1440p, so the gap is not that big, even at 1080p, intel is like 10% faster, thats 10 FPS for 100 FPS, who cares about the 10 FPS if you are getting 100 FPS?!?now for 1440p, its like 4%-5% FPS win for intel which is a trivial amount to look at when considering what you are getting in return from this CPU.Last, memory support is working magically with the new Ryzen 3000 CPUs, the compatibility with higher frequencies has enhanced alot, i had trouble making it post at 3600 Mhz RAM, but i had yet to discover that you need to install the RAM modules into specific slots for better compatibility, SO MAKE SURE TO INSTALL YOUR RAM INTO THE SLOTS MENTIONED IN YOUR MB MANUAL, otherwise the system will fail to post if memory is more than 3000/3200 even if the memory itself has faster frequency.i was able to stretch the timings of the memory to 16-18-19-36 from 18-22-22-42 which gave a nice performance boost as well.For reference here is my full system specs:Asus Rog Strix X570 Gaming-FAsus Rog Strix Geforce 1080Ti OC16 GB (2x8) G.Skill Tridentz Royal 3600 Mhz CL18 (This is Hynix CJR Die not Samsung B-Die and it performs well)Cooler Master ML240R RGB AIOSamsung 970 Evo Plus PCIe NVME1000W EVGA PSU2 SSDs and 3 HDDsCooler Master Cosmos C700M Case

  The heavens looked down upon on us mere mortals and proclaimed ""I have given you my only computer architecture. Embrace it, for this is your only savior in the realm of hardcore PC gaming""What can I say, this thing is amazing. My updated X470 was able to see it no problem. Power usage is down significantly over my previous 2700 (using that processor for a rig I'm building for my little bro). No need to overclock, as the 3000 series pretty much works like GPU Boost, but for CPU's. It will basically push itself to the max based on cooling. With an H55 cooler and Prime95, I was hitting about 80 C°, which is perfectly in-line of what a CPU can handle.Basically, AMD is back on top. Zen 2 is the architecture that will save us all from the clutches of overpricing and minimal IPC gains. All hail glorious Zen 2, the true KING OF KINGS!!!

The absolute sweet-spot AMD Ryzen 3000 Series CPU (3700X), but annoying RGB on CPU Wraith fan.
","

  I purchased this AMD RYZEN 3700X CPU for my first AMD build, since I feel that this (or even the AMD Ryzen 3600) are the sweet-spot for people not interested in throwing a ton of money at a new desktop build, or overclocking hardware in general - but still having a system with robust performance capabilities.11/18/2019 - I assembled my new desktop system this last weekend, and all the hardware meshed together & booted up just fine on the first try.  No issues to report, other than installing a fresh Windows 10 OS & all the SW extras from scratch is a pain.  After getting the new Windows 10 Home 64-bit OS installed & set up on the SSD boot drive, I was able to take a look at a few things.  On default BIOS settings (no overclocking), the new 3700X CPU scored 4781 on the Cinebench R20 CPU benchmark.  My previous 2015 Intel i5-6500 system build scored 1296 on the same test last week before I decommissioned it.  My 3700X idle CPU temps in the Corsair ICUE 220T high-airflow case (4 fans) is 33-34C average (25C (77F) ambient room temps).  A one-minute full-on stress test benchmark on the CPU took it up to 68-69C maximum.  Everything seems to be running normally thus far, though you will need to tweak/adjust the CPU fan curve settings yourself in BIOS because the default ones had the CPU fan spinning up & down unnecessarily in the routine-task 30-50C range.  I just set my CPU fan to run at a constant/quiet reasonable 50% speed for all temps up to 50C & then start slowly ramping up from there as needed in those rare extra-load circumstances.  I also have my 3 front 120mm case fans running at a constant 50% & the single rear-exhaust 120mm fan at 60%.  Works great.KNOCKING OFF ONE STAR - My only real complaint with this AMD product is that not everyone likes tacky, obnoxious RGB lighting all over the place in their PC builds.  The Wraith fan should come with it TURNED OFF by default & only allow people to turn it on if they wish via the extra cable that comes with it for RGB software controller purposes.  KNOCKING OFF 1 STAR for AMD not having a simple OFF switch for the RGB on the CPU FAN housing SO IT NEVER COMES ON.  The RGB is annoying as hell & there is NO WAY to have it OFF 100% from power-start to power-shutdown.  Fan works great other than that though, lol.UPDATE 11/25/2019 - I have come across some non-fatal MSI BIOS and/or AMD Driver issues related to the B450 chip-set (or Ryzen 3000 Series operation in general) that I am trying to work through with regards to initial start-up/booting in Windows.  Shame that such a great new piece of hardware (this CPU) is being hobbled by immature/buggy BIOS and/or drivers on the part of AMD or MSI.UPDATE 11/27/2019 - I went ahead & flashed the motherboard BIOS with the latest MSI build, which is 7C02v35 (just out of beta today & now official). I also installed the latest release 11/25/2019 AMD B450 chipset drivers (1.11.22.0454) directly from the AMD site over the top of the older MSI version chipset drivers from the MSI site. In addition, I updated my NVIDIA GPU drivers to the latest version, instead of the older ones that Windows 10 automatically installs when you boot up your new Windows 10 installation for the first time. Everything has been working picture perfect since I did all that.Hardware specs for my latest 1080p gaming & home/office productivity PC build:- CASE: CORSAIR ICUE 220T RGB Airflow ATX Mid-Tower (Black, x3 RGB Fans Removed) - FAN(S): CORSIAR ML120 PRO 120mm Premium Magnetic Levitation PWM 4-Pin Fans (4 Total - 3 Front Intake & 1 Rear Exhaust)- PSU: SEASONIC PRIME Ultra 650W 80+ Platinum 140mm Compact ATX (SSR-650PD2)- MOTHERBOARD: MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX (ATX Form-Factor), Ryzen 3000 Revision Board w/Expanded BIOS- CPU: AMD RYZEN 3700X 8-Core 16-Thread w/Wraith Prism Cooler (Using Innovation Cooling Graphite Thermal Pad 40x40mm)- MEMORY: KINGSTON HyperX Fury 32GB (4x8GB) 3200MHz DDR4 CL15 DIMMs (HX432C16FB3K2/16 x 2)- WIFI ADAPTER: ASUS AX3000 Next-Gen WiFi-6 Dual Band PCIe Wireless Adapter (PCE-AX58BT)- GPU: EVGA NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 TI SC ULTRA GAMING (06G-P4-1667-KR)- INTERNAL BOOT/SYSTEM DRIVE: INTEL SSD D3-S4610 Enterprise-Class Series (SSDSC2KG480G801) 480GB SATA 2.5- INTERNAL SECONDARY DRIVE: WESTERN DIGITAL BLUE HDD 500GB SATA 2.5

What an upgrade!
","

  I bought an original first-generation Ryzen 7 1700 with a completely new build in 2017, a few months after they launched, and I was very happy with the purchases I made. I use my PC primarily for gaming, although it is also used some for working remotely (remote desktop to a computer at work) and for school, which is mostly online, and I also do some light photo and audio editing and encoding. At the time, it just didn't make sense to pay the premium for a Core i7 when I could get four more cores and still get decent performance in single core workloads for less money with the Ryzen part, however I knew I was making a compromise. The Core i7 did achieve higher frame rates, and gaming was the primary workload for this build.After the Ryzen 3000 release, it appears AMD has all but eliminated that gap in single core performance and even improved their parts and platform in other ways. I knew I had to have one. I briefly considered a 3800X, but reviews showed that the difference in performance was miniscule for a $70 premium, so I went with this part. I also bought a cooler (Be Quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4) because I had been using the stock cooler with my 1700 and I wanted to get everything I could out of this new part. I upgraded the BIOS on my MSI X370 Gaming Pro Carbon before the new CPU arrived, so when it did I just pulled the old one, swapped in the new one, and installed the new cooler, and it booted right up! Of course, the BIOS reset itself to defaults which wasn't surprising, so I made sure to turn on PBO and set my 3200MHz G. Skill memory to its XMP profile and I was pleasantly surprised when it booted at those speeds without a problem, as with the 1700 it wasn't even stable 100% of the time with 2933MHz memory. Of course, then I got greedy and tried to set it to 3600MHz memory and IF clock to 1800MHz without changing any voltages or timings, and that....didn't go well. It was worth trying, anyway. So then I booted it into Windows and started testing.Even with the new cooler this part does run a little hot. I'm probably going to try to reapply thermal paste (Prolimatech PK-2), as I'm not totally confident I didn't screw that up somehow, but it's not going to fry itself or anything. Under heavy load with a constant boost around 4.15GHz all core or 4.3-4.4GHz boost on 1-4 cores (and despite the fact that motherboard manufacturers seem to set the voltage higher than necessary, 1.4-1.45V for me most of the time) I never see temps over 75-76C, and idle is around 38-40C. Like I said, high, but not terrible.More important than the temps is the performance, and that's a win for the 3700X. I have seen a consistent increase of about 30% in frame rates for most games, and in some games it's even more than that. In other areas there is a noticeable increase in performance as well, audio encodes noticeably faster, applications seem to load a little faster, etc. Overall, this kind of performance improvement for around $400 is amazing, and I'm glad I was able to do this even with a motherboard that's almost two years old.

  Its the time for Zen 2……right? Probably not.I purchased 2 ryzen 7 3700x一 and tested 1 3900x, the result told me waiting is the best option now.1, the performance improved greatly to Ryzen 2 2700x, or even to Intel cpus. Cinebench R20 score of 3700x, is 4401 (@Stock), 4634(@4.0g), 4746(@4.1g),4809(@4.2g)for 8 cores and 463(@4.1Ghz), 477(@4.2Ghz) for single core. Ryzen 2700x scored 3959, which is 2000 lower than Ryzen 9 3900x.2, On Msi x470 M7 ac, Zen 2 cpus ram control function tells quiet different stories:When 2 dimms r used, following fre tested and passed RunMemoTest pro(1000%):(1)3600 (2)3733 (3)3800 works @ 1t-16-16-16-16-36. Fclk can be manually set @ 1800/1867/1900mhz, no DRAM adjustment needed(1.35v).(2)If setting DRAM voltage @ 1.4v, 3700x supports up to 4133 Ram, but FCLK cant be adjustted, 3900x never reached higher than 3866.When four dimms are occupied, none of Zen 2 cpu could pass RunMemtest Pro @ speed above DDR4 3600mhz. Another thing needs to be mentioned is timing affected little on Zen 2 cpus, when set @ 3800Mhz w/ 3 timing settings: (1) 1t-16-16-16-36 (2) 1t-18-18-18-38 (3) 1t-18-20-20-20-44, differences r within 1%.  Currently I can say Ram control improved greatly on Zen 2 to Zen+ ---my 2700x wokrs up to 3600 only---but still worse than Intel cpus.  Also, 2 rams r best choice cuz it scores higher and compatiable more freq. X570 is said performs much better, but havent got a chance to test.3, Core voltage is too high. I'm not saying VID but CV. Both 3700x and 3900x come w/ 1.48+v stock CV. Worse still, zen 2 cpus rely heavily on CV and this leads to more heat and power. Even 65w 3700x is hotter and cost more power than 2700x(stock speed). Undervoltting? May be. But it also may cuz a lot of performance loss. I have tried a couple of hrs to find the best balance point and you will need too. Now stress tested (by AIDA64 CPU&FPU, by Prime95): 1.215v@4ghz, 1.25v@4.1ghz, 1.32v@4.2ghz. The lowest stock CV of 3700x I've seen is 1.44v and 1.47v of Ryzen 3900x.4, OC? not a good news for ocers, but a good news for common users. One 3700x reaches all core 4.4ghz @ 1.5v... 0.1v higher than 2700x @ same clock.5, Still have a lot to say, but i hate typing... Long story short, its not the time to buy zen 2 now, not cuz cpus r not good, but cuz AMD needs  to fix a lot to make it fully functional.

  Bought this from AMD authorized reseller and it was boxed pretty well and came in excellent condition. I almost had to return it, thought it had a defective fan. But upon further troubleshooting, it was a BIOS issue after continued CPU Fan Error on boot and the fan not spinning. The light would work and the fan would spin a few revolutions and stop. I then upgraded my BIOs on my ASUS 350-F motherboard from 4801 to 5008 and it fixed the fan issue. Processor is a champ compared to my 1700 Ryzen.  FPS on gaming (GTX1080) is 40-60 fps more but also no significant drops compared to before. I also played Rocket League the other night on all setting on high and it was at 250 fps most of the time and dropping to 240 here and there. I'm also happy that my memory can run and its stock speeds at 3200 mhz with no issues, before I could only run it at 2600mhz range for stability.

Good for Gaming and Great for Productivity
","

  This processor is powerful to be sure and a great bang for buck. Maybe not the top of gaming heap but still up there and if you do anything else besides strictly gaming, this processor is a fine choice. While mostly for gaming in my case, I also do multi-camera video editing and full blown musical production (16 track home studio based on Presonus Studio One Pro software) so I'm willing to trade a little (very little) gaming performance for some more productivity muscle. But believe me, that game performance in not suffering a noticeable amount at all (coming from an i7 7700k oc'ed) paired with my RTX 2070. I must mention however that overclocking the Ryzen 3000 is a bit different than my previous builds. With extremely rare exceptions, most Ryzen 3000 chips are not able able to fully overclock to their advertised boost speed on all cores like you could with previous versions. Even more rare is actually exceeding the 4.4 boost clock in any fashion. However with that being said, you can far exceed the base clock of this processor with overclocking. If you chasing the highest possible single core speed, then you maybe better off not overclocking because of the reasons stated above. But also note that the 4.4 ghz max boost clock is very rarely seen in actual use by most users. I'm more than willing to sacrifice that extra 100 mhz boost on a single core to get 4.3 ghz stable on all cores. I was also able to oc my Corsair Dominator DDR4 3200 memory to 3600 mhz and the Infinity Fabric oc'ed by 200 mhz as well. I'm scoring over 5200 points in Cinebench R20 (doubling the score that my old 7700k hit).  I feel that I came out pretty well in the silicone lottery with mine considering that those sites selling pre-binned/tested CPUs are selling 3700x guaranteed to hit 4.3 ghz (the max they offer) with about $150 mark up. I can't say everyone could hit 4.3 stable on all cores but I believe most could hit 4.2 on all cores just fine. All in all, a great value in my book.

  This is my first CPU in my first build, so I don’t have a whole lot of experience to reference or compare. What I can say, is that my new PC has been running flawlessly since I finished it, and Ryzen Master software is a great user friendly way to control and modify your CPU. You can do anything from overclock to turn of SMT and much more with just a click. I’m running this CPU stock with the stock cooler, and I’m sitting around 30 degrees C at idle and 55 degrees C while gaming. Mostly RB6S and Fallout 4. I’m not an expert so I won’t go into any details that I only partly understand about clock speed and voltage, but when I compare my average metrics with what the chip is rated for, I’m right where I should be. I paired the 3700x with a Radeon rx 5700 xt and I’m very happy so far.

Not a smooth upgrade...
","

  Now that I have it running the CPU is great but it wasn't an easy road to get it running. I have had a bunch of Ryzen CPUs and motherboards from the beginning and this was the hardest CPU to get running. In my excitement after getting the CPU, I pulled my 2700x and installed the 3700x. I thought I had upgraded my UEFI within the last month so I thought I was good to go. I thought they were rolling out the updates for the new CPUs earlier so I'd be able to boot it and update my UEFI to the latest version after the swap. I am using an Asus Crosshair VII. Well, it didn't boot. I cleared CMOS and still no go. I think ooh I got a mobo that can flash without a CPU my expensive board feature is going to pay off. Well, I figured out that the board can flash without a CPU but it will not flash with a CPU in the socket even if it isn't working. So I had to take the CPU back out, flash the latest UEFI, and then reinstall the CPU. Then it still didn't boot. I kept getting stuck on a C5 UEFI code. Then after some forum research, I found I had to set my memory boot voltage. Then I got it going but I cannot cold boot still without resetting the CMOS and redoing the settings each time.  These problems existed in the past with 1st generation products but it seems they have returned. My transition from a 1700 to a 2700x was super easy and without issue. This hasn't been as smooth. Everything seems to be working well with the CPU since I got it installed and running. Reading around online I see a lot of people having problems that seem to be real. Lagging UEFI updates, Destiny 2 not running (fixed), unable to boot, etc... So unless you are pretty hardware literate and able to work through potential problems you might want to wait a little longer until things get ironed out. SO CPU itself great, integration into existing ecosystem not so great right now.

Not as great as the hype. Lots of underlying issues.
","

  This processor is definitely not bad, but it does NOT live up to the hype. Firstly, I want to get this out of the way. AMD's wraith prism cooler is hot (literally) garbage. It's barely able to cool the process effectively, especially when boosting is enabled, not to mention it is EXCESSIVELY loud. If you really want this processor, budget for a good aftermarket cooler.Also, please be aware there is an ongoing issue of these chips volting too much and too often in order to achieve their advertised boost clocks. Using default settings, I was seeing extended volt intervals of 1.48 - 1.5. This causes core temperature to spike drastically and their awful stock cooler to max out and sound like a rocket taking off. Couple this with the fact that it's extremely volatile and will ramp up and down constantly, and you have a formula for maximum frustration. I ultimately had to turn boost off entirely to get the thing to a respectable temp and shut up. If you google around you will find multiple discussion threads talking about this very same issue.Possible compatibility issues with Nvidia turing cards. Yes, this is also an ongoing battle. For some reason when you pair Zen2 chips like this one with an Nvidia turing card (20 series) there is a nasty bug that causes the video driver to crash repeatedly or just crash your whole system. This happens when the Nvidia is set to optimal power mode which downclocks your GPU PCI Express mode from 3.0, to 2.0, or 1.1. It seems that applications / games that are heavy on the CPU and light on GPU are the worst culprits for making this bug appear. Worse yet, AMD denies any issues with their chip, even though this does not impact intel using the same Nvidia cards.If you can deal with all of what I mentioned above, and you have a really good AIO / air cooler, you might find this chip to be a good deal. Overall, if I could go back, I would just go with intel and avoid the headache.

A good decision
","

  Pros:- Excellent performance.- Doesn't get hot in gaming (see below about this).- Fairly quiet fan.- The fan is easy to install. No need to screw it into your motherboard. Makes replacing it much easier.- The fan's RGB is great with the Wraith Prism software (note: plug in the USB header only).- Good price for such a powerful CPU.- AMD is ethical unlike Intel.Cons:- Pretty high idle temperatures. I'm getting ~50-60C. The pro of this is that games don't heat up the CPU by much more than that, basically stays at idle temperature at all times, sometimes rises to 70C. May just be my fan curve.- Because the temperatures fluctuate, the fan spins up and down constantly at idle. You'll have to make a flat fan curve for idle temperatures.- Fan tends to produce echo sound when spinning up (coil whine), but not always.Other thoughts:Love this CPU. If you're thinking about getting a Ryzen CPU, this is the one. The 3800X is not worth it for anyone. The 3600X and below come with cheap fans. The 3700X is the perfect fit for gaming and other use cases.

Check your BIOS version
","

  I bought this chip with a B450-F chipset on a new motherboard, knowing that chipset does support the 3700X after a BIOS update. I took the gamble hoping my motherboard had the update, but it didn't. I also knew before hand that AMD had a boot kit loan where they loan you a CPU to update your motherboard. Sadly I didn't look into the boot kit loan more before I bought the CPU. If your motherboard doesn't have CPU-less EZ flash, and you don't have an older AM4 processor, you'll need to get an older AM4 processor or go through AMD's loan service.AMD makes it an extremely tedious process to get a loan from them. You have to contact the manufacturer of your motherboard first, and get an e-mail or text chat from them stating that AMD's loan kit is the best option (as in, there's no way the motherboard manufacturer can help you). Then you have to send that, an invoice, pictures of your processor, and pictures of your motherboard. Even after doing all of this AMD wasn't happy with one of my pictures, delaying the boot kit even more.What's worse is it takes them about a day to respond, and they don't work on weekends. You have to send an initial ""i need a boot kit"" e-mail first too, so you're waiting at least a day before you can send them your documents, then hope they approve of them, then they ship you off the loan kit.By the time I got approved I had found somebody selling an older AM4 processor on craigslist for cheap so I just went and bought that and updated my motherboard that way. The boot kit service is extremely inconvenient and they require almost government ID levels of verification that you own the stupid processor for some reason.Now that it's up and running, the processor was well, well worth the money. I wouldn't have bought the B450-F chipset had I known the loan kit was going to be such an impossibility to get. Make sure you can update your motherboard or buy one that supports third gen Ryzen without an update.

  Ok look - if youre JUST going to be gaming, get the Ryzen 5 3600.  If you plan to stream or use discord and chrome and 3+ monitors - get this.  If I tried to stream (Faster OBS preset 720p60fps 7k bitrate) and play COD on Ultra, the Ryzen 5 3600 will max out.  You open a google chrome window or even spotify, and your stream will lag.  I upgraded to the Ryzen 7 3700x.  I was able to go up to FAST OBS preset - everything else the same.  This time the game and stream would only use 60-70%.  Plenty of left over room to run chrome, discord, spotify, and other programs.  You will also get more FPS in game when streaming.  Streaming w/ the 3600, I would get 120FPS in COD.  Now with the 3700x, if I stream, I will get 140-150 FPS.Again,  If you plan on JUST to game - get the 3600.  If you plan to do more than just game, get this.

AMD strikes again!

  Solid processor, this thing does wonders for video production and editing. It's a bit overkill with the core count, but it's great for some ""future-proofing"" since most new games and software don't really use more than 4 cores just yet.(I've currently owned this for about 2 weeks as of writing this review)Pros:1. 8 cores. 16 threads. Need I say more?2. Comes with a stunning looking CPU fan, synced with Asus Aura, it's a purchase I don't regret.3. Works flawlessly under intensive work loads. Renders videos like it's nothing.4. Extremely easy install. It's practically just clipped in.5. Comes with thermal paste pre-installed. No extra purchases necessary to install this.Cons:1. The CPU fan that comes with it isn't made for overclocking, so don't try that without an upgraded cooler.2. Nothing else, this is a solid processor.Highly recommend, it's an amazing value for what you get, but like I mentioned above, if you're looking to overclock, I wouldn't recommend it with the CPU cooler that comes with it. Otherwise, even out of the box, it shreds just about anything I throw at it. Solid buy, 10/10 recommend.

Superb value - right at the sweet spot of price-performance

  I use my PC for gaming as well as photo editing, so I needed a CPU with some power behind it. Hoo boy. I did my research, and after upgrading to the 3700X with an Asus 570X motherboard, I couldn't be happier. It's worth noting that this is my first AMD CPU since building a K6-2 PC back in the 90's. AMD really has Intel beat as far as price-to-performance goes nowadays.As expected, the install was quick and easy. The heatsink while massive, is gorgeous and unbelievably quiet. Lightroom and Photoshop run like a dream. And AMD's ""Ryzen Master"" software for monitoring and overclocking is really cool. Very pleased with the purchase, and highly recommended.

It's okay I guess? Bad value though and I regret buying it
","

  I got suckered in by the hype on this and bought it. It's okay, does all right in games but it gets absolutely massacred by my friend's 9700k. It looked pretty promising in reviews at the time but unfortunately that didn't translate over to many of the games I actually play, and it's disappointing in MMOs and games that don't utilize multithreading well. People say ryzen is better value but it's honestly not, Intel's motherboards are much cheaper and this thing falls behind the 9700k at the same price point by like 20-30%. I regret buying it, as it's a painful lesson that hype isn't everything.If you're video editing or 3d rendering though, this thing is amazing. But for gaming and general use I think most people are better off with an i7, as AMD still has a lot of ground to make up in that department. Sadly I'm outside my return window now so I can't get my money back so I guess I'm stuck with it until I decide to build another pc.

  I'm using the stock cooler that came with this and apart from disliking the latch retention design and it not being as good as say a 70+ dollar or whatever after market cooler the heatsink is fine. At idle (chrome open, watching twitch stream, etc) it runs the CPU around 40C. It's also boosting all cores by 200hz automatically so 3.8GHz vs the 3.6GHz baseclock though that's still a farcry from ""4.4 GHz max boost"" that AMD claims. I'm running the chipset driver that AMD just released on july 30th to make Destiny 2 finally work with the 3000 series of CPU's and it's just a temp one. Maybe boosting will get better in the future once they work these things over I could see the cooler being able to handle 4.0GHZ.either way the performance gain I get at even stock speeds over my old i5-3570k is outstanding. I'm immensely happy with this and glad I waited for the 7nm 3rd gen.Edit: 8/14/2019.Got my 3700X up to 4.25GHz all cores @ 1.2875 voltage with stock heatsink, but it warmed itself up to 91c.

Perfect upgrade from a 4770K

  The most bang for your buck without breaking the bank when it comes to building a content creation/gaming PC. I'm a graphic designer by trade and a gamer at heart, and I was in the market to upgrade to an 8-core CPU since building my 4770K rig in early 2014. I was tired of Intel's price gouging especially after the 9900K released last year so that's when I drew the line and said enough was enough. So, after getting word regarding all the hype surrounding AMD's 7nm Ryzen 3000 CPUs, I realized the time was now to take advantage of the opportunity to upgrade to a 3700X based on its specs and recent BF deals being advertised before some crisis e.g., a cryptocurrency phase, comes around the corner and makes them artificially scarce. So far, I've had my rig running for 2 days after finally completing the build since receiving all of my PC components and I must say I have no regrets based on my experience and due to my IT expertise, I was able to transfer the image of my Intel PC over to my Ryzen PC in its entirety and I didn't even have to reactivate Windows again.I'm not a fanboy but after realizing how much advanced tech Intel had been holding back after all of these years in the HEDT market segment, I was finally able to pull the wool from over my eyes and I saw the light: Ryzen shine  ;-)My specs:AMD 3700XASUS PRIME X570-PFractal Design Define R6ZOTAC GTX 1080 TiEVGA SuperNOVA 1000 G2 PSUbe quiet!

  I upgraded from a first-gen Ryzen 5 1600 and I didn't think I would see a very big uptick in gaming performance with my GTX 1080, but WOW was I wrong! I'm seeing anywhere from 10-30% increases in framerate depending on the game.Frame timings also seem to be MASSIVELY improved - every game I tried ran noticeably smoother than it did before, even if they only had modest improvements in framerate.That's not even mentioning the uptick in productivity performance. My Cinebench score improved by 46% over the 1600, plus my RAM will finally run at its advertised 3200MHz (2933 was my previous limit). And of course, the gorgeous RGB CPU cooler is just icing on the cake.If anyone is curious or wants to save money over the X570 boards, I'm using the MSI X470 Gaming Plus and it is having no issues keeping up with the 3700x. Just update the BIOS and you're good to go.

Not impressed

  It works but not as advertised.  Have it paired w/ a MSI B450 Tomahawk Max and it doesn’t boost to 4.4 on any single core.  It will hit 4.2 all core and maybe 4.3 on a single core but I have to turn up the voltage a lot.  PBO makes it worse and all core goes down to 4.0 w/ single core at 4.1.Overall everything is slow.  Maybe I’m expecting to much coming from high end Ultrabooks for the past decade plus.  I built this desktop to convert DVDs and a very large CD/Live Show collection.  The extra threads speed up these programs.  But the boot time and program load speed is just slow.  BIOS boot time is four times as long as my current Lenovo Ultrabook.It’s working and is stable.  But I’m wondering if I should have used Intel instead.  Or just bought a prebuilt.  I guess I should build a system w/ a 9900K to see how boot times and load speed compare.  This is the biggest annoyance for me.

This sucker is a huge step up
","

  For reference to this review, I previously own a Ryzen 7 2700x. Why did I make such a small upgrade with little performance boost: 2 reasons.1. My 2700x was beginning to fail on me with intermittent crashes that either triggered from thermal instability or voltage spikes....at least that's what I thought initially. After replacing this part, I came to realize I'd damaged the internals/circuitry/die from excessive OCing in the BIOS. Along with that came the horrendous heat transfers I was getting (which would then cause thermal throttling), which unfortunately was corrected too late (my CPU radiator and fans were in a less-powerful config: push, so I reconfigured to pull, and the temps were noticably better. But it was too late). At any rate, I had damaged my poor 2700X for being careless.2. Because I was suffering from thermal throttling, even in pull config with my 2700X, I wanted something with less than 105W, with this one dropping significantly to 65W, and having a boost clock .2 GHz higher than my previous 2700X (I lost the lottery and couldn't get it to go higher than 4.2 GHz with throttling involved). I used to get average temps in the 40-65 degrees range with daily use on my 2700X. This 3700X gives me nothing over 65 degrees UNDER FULL LOAD. That temp difference meant the world upon benchmarking and stress-testing. To allow an even bigger illustration of just how much this CPU jumps in performance, regardless of the GHz and clocked specs: my current CPU at slower clock speeds beat my fully-OCed and undervolted 2700X by 300 points in Cinebench R15, and had a score of 4932 points at 4.2 GHz (4th overall, outranking the 2700X at 4.15 GHz, with a score of 4063. Almost 900 points!)Needless to say, but I am quite impressed with the thermal performance, the clock speeds, and the overall performance of this processor unit, especially since I bought it at a cheaper, if not the same price point when I bought my 2700XWithout doubt a worthy investment, and a definitive recommendation from me for any AMD PC builds that want the best bang for their buck from an 8-core processor! The biggest reveal of all is that I am running this on an MSI x470 Gaming Plus MOBO, not the x570 with the PCI-E 4.0 and Gen 4 Support! I am running this on a Gen 3 and PCI-E 3.0 (i.e. less performance and data speeds, but nonetheless compatible, and still faster than my 2700X)

Disable ""Core Performance Boost"" to drop temperatures 20 degrees.

  It seemed to run really hot, temperatures were fluctuating, and my case fans were constantly spinning up and down every few seconds which was incredibly annoying.--- SOLUTION: Disable ""Core Performance Boost"" in your BIOS.[This dropped my temperatures around 20 degrees (from 50-60C idle to around 32C, and from over 80C during load to around 52C during load), and solved my fan issue.]The name of this setting might differ depending on your motherboard brand (something related to core boost / enhancement):- For AsRock motherboards, you have to go to Advanced > AMD CBS > CPU COMMON OPTIONS > Core Performance Boost and change that from Auto to Disabled.- For Gigabyte Aorus boards:Restart and keep tapping Del to enter the BIOS.Press F2 to switch to Advanced Mode.Under the ""Tweaker"" tab, go into ""Advanced CPU Settings"" (press Enter or click on it).Press Enter on ""Core Performance Boost"" and change it from Auto to Disabled.Save settings and exit.(That setting ""automatically allows the processor to run faster than its marked frequency..."" which sounds like some sort of automatic overclocking that isn't working well.)You might want to make sure your BIOS is updated as well.It's been running fantastic after that one change!

  I have had 0 trouble with the system build.  The 3700X has 65W thermal design so I was able to easily use the standard AMD cooler, and after testing, it keeps it cool.  I also reduced my power supply down to 500W due to needing half the wattage from my FX8350.I used to buy Intel, but the last 5 computers that I have built have been AMD.  AMD is much more cost effective, and the Ryzen 3700x is a steam roller.  You can do whatever you want for years with it.  I have it paired with a Asus Prime Pro Mother board, and I am using NVMe RAID 1 (Samsung EVO 500GB).  You can get to windows from wake in about 2-3 seconds.

Nothing to complain about here

  I've only used this for one full day but have absolutely no complaints here. I wasn't exactly wanting this one but it was one of my only options. I originally wanted to get the Ryzen 5 3600 but contemplated too much and it quickly sold out everywhere. I then chose to get the 3600X and same thing. Within the time of me adding it to my cart and having to leave for 15 minutes, came back and it had sold out. So I chose to go with this one and do not regret it at all. Regardless of it costing more and making me go well over my budget I'm happy with it. It's lightning fast and I haven't experience any bottleneck from it. I can have my game open and minimize it and open Mozilla with plenty of tabs open with absolutely no lag. Everything is ultra responsive for me. Opening programs like Adobe Photoshop use to take up to 30 seconds to load now opens in 5-10 seconds. It comes with a fantastic stock cooler which is very much up to the job in terms of keeping the CPU cool. I personally haven't used it as I bought an aftermarket cooler but have seen it in action and it does its job well. I'd say I should get a good 7-10 years of use out of my current PC build. Minus a few upgrades in graphics card and RAM. I don't see myself having to upgrade my CPU for a long time.

Truly amazing speed benchmarks for a 65W CPU
","

  The performance of the Ryzen 7 3700X was everything it was advertised to be.  I was looking for a CPU to provide high performance with the lowest TDP and the 3700X fit the bill.  I am rating it as 5 stars in warmth because at 65W TDP it isn't warm at all even under load according to SpeedFan.  Installation was typically easy as it is for all AM4 sockets.However, after one month of stable operation my computer suddenly and without warning stopped and there was zero output from the HDMI port.  To be clear, it was not an OS crash and there was Win10 BSOD or memory dump.  When I power cycled the computer there was no POST, video output from the HDMI port at all, and most strangely not BIOS error beeps to indicate that either the graphics card or CPU was not present.  My first attempt at fault isolation was to test the graphics card in a different computer and it worked fine.  I then tested the DDR4 DIMMs in a different computer and they were working fine.  My third assumption was that the motherboard had failed so I returned that one for exchange and ended up with a different brand and model.  When I reinstalled the CPU, graphics card, and RAM in the new motherboard I got no POST, no video output, and no BIOS beeps.  At this point it was apparent to me that the CPU was the failed component.  I bought at much cheaper Ryzen 3 3200 as a stopgap replacement and it worked fine as soon as I powered it up.  I have never had a CPU fail on a computer that I owned going all the way back to my first Intel 8088 CPU and first AMD K2.I contacted AMD via their customer service website and requested RMA.  They responded immediately with an RMA and I followed the instructions to carefully package the CPU and return it for their examination.  **Be very careful not to physically damage or even scuff the top of the CPU if you have to return it**.  AMD makes very clear on their website that bent or broken pins will not be considered a component failure and the evidence of damage to the top thermal conduction surface to include scrathes will also be considered evidence of customer inflicted damage.  I carefully followed the procedures and repackaged the 3700X after delicately wiping off the thermal paste and sent it back to AMD.Within a week of shipping the failed CPU back to AMD they contacted me by email to let me know that they had confirmed the CPU failed and were sending to me a new retail boxed 3700X that arrived 7 days after I received it.  I am very pleased with the customer support from AMD and I look forward to installing and testing the new Ryzen 7 3700X.  After a lengthly burn-in period I will consider updating the stability rating for this CPU.  My first CPU was probably an outlier but I will leave the stability rating at 1 star so that my experience can be a data point for those considering the 3700X.

I then adjusted some settings according to Buildzoid's videos & got those multi-threaded clocks up to 4.1-4.3GHz easily. Tuning my ram to 3800MHz with Infinity Clock at 1900MHz after that has it just touching the 5K Cinebench R20 score I was hoping for.No hassle. No regrets. No disappointment.

  Best value for a CPU today, and plenty fast.  It feels a bit kludgy, though--for instance, temps (at least as reported by the chip) jump 10C+ up then back down over 2 seconds without the speed changing even with good cooling--graphing the temps  I get a saw-tooth pattern between 47C and 57C.If you need an upgrade now, this is the chip to buy.

  Pros:- Super-FAST, can work on X370 ASUS Prime and X570 motherboards- Memory DOCP setting in BIOS is no fuss no muss. MAX XMP speed 3333 MHZ (Best is 3600 per AMD, not higher)- ASUS x570 Hero VIII, great board for this CPU- If your upgrading a motherboard too, you can swap your boot drive from a Prev Gen Ryzen no need to reinstall Windows 10.  Windows 10 does a good job at this and you can install the new AMD drivers from your motherboard's website.- Make sure you have new BIOS installed or ready to update before you even boot into Windows.  Even if you have a new X570 board.- Runs at full boost clock!Cons:- First CPU I got had a SMP error, blue screen on Windows (was 3rd party not Amazon).  Got a 2nd from Amazon directly 2nd CPU had no errors Perfect.  This is rare for CPU to have errors, AMD or Intel.- Cooler thermal paste is sticky not good on the Prisim cooler, wraith spire coolers appear to have a different compound on them that’s better IMHO.  I would clean with 90% rubbing Alcohol (not 70% that has oil in it), then use Arctic Silver 5 or cooler master thermal compound.  Note: Use only a drop in the middle of the CPU, size of pea is all you need.  The heat-sink will smooth it out with pressure when you lock it down.Conclusion: This is a no brainier upgrade from AMD Ryzen 1st gen or Intel any Intel I5 to I7.  If your mainly a gamer, buy the 3600x and save $90.  Any of these 3rd Gen's are stupid fast and beat all latest I5 and most I7 / I9 processors.

The 3700x is a Fantastic Chip at its price point
","

  Summary:If you want a mid-range machine that's future proof for at least the next few years, this fits the bill nicely. Get a chip that trades blows with an i9-9900K for $200 less and uses less power doing it. Yes, Intel's higher clock speed will allow it to be faster at certain workloads & games, but it's usually not by much. Regarding gaming, if you're running at 1080p or 1440p and not running a top of the line video card, the difference between the 3700x and 9900K is negligible. For workstation use, it's a no brainer, unless you want to up to a 3900x.Building computers and keeping up to date with all the latest hardware is my hobby and second job. I was an AMD guy back in the Athlon XP & Athlon 64 days, but once it was Sandy Bridge vs Buldozer, there was basically no reason to go AMD. For years, I built basically nothing but Intel Machines. Ryzen's intro was exciting to me, AMD is now competitive again! But other than a couple of builds for people, I skipped the first 2 generations. Now, Gen 2 chips are cheap, and Gen 3 chips can not only hold there own, but often outperform Intel in many tasks, sometimes even gaming! And even when they loose, it's not by much.So the 3700x gives great performance for the money, but what about stability and easy of setup? Well, it's nearly as good as Intel. Regarding stability, I'd say their fantastic as long as you avoid AMD Video Card drivers, which are a bit flaky at the moment. But with an Nvidia card, rock stable. Now, I said nearly as good as intel due to the drivers, BIOS updates, and power and voltage situation. For most current intel systems, the platform is so mature that everything generally just works out of the box. No drivers or power plans required, Windows 10 knows what to do with the platform. But with AMD Zen 2, there are potential issues on older chip-sets and not being able to boot without BIOS updates, performance issues with older BIOS updates, etc. On top of that, you really want to get the chip-set drivers & power plans to have the best configuration. None of this is hard, but Intel is already so integrated into Windows 10. But with Ryzen gaining market-share at their current pace, integration and optimization will be there soon.Most of the time, you want to build a balanced system. Here are my CPU suggestions based on price points (Approximations)$500 to $800 builds: 1600X AF (Which is basically a 2600X)$800 to $1300 Builds: 3600$1200 to $2500 Builds: 3700X$1800 to $3400 Builds: 3900X$2500+ Builds: $3950XMy wife and I rebuild our gaming systems this past Holiday season. Here's my latest rig with this chip:Processor: AMD 3700XVideo Card: Nvidia GTX 1070 (used)RAM: 32GB G-Skill Dual Channel 3600Mhz CAS16Motherboard: MSI X570 Carbon (Good For 3800X and below, VRMs may run hot on 3900X and above)Sound: Sound Blaster ZSSD: 1GB A-DATA SX8200 Pro & 2x 2TB Crucial (1100 & MX500)PSU: Seasonic 750W GoldCase: Fractal Design Define CCPU Cooler: Noctua DH-15Fans: 4x 140mm Noctua AF-14 & 1x 120mm Noctua AF-12Gaming and productivity have been fantastic with no issues. I really want more GPU power, but I'm waiting for the prices to come down for Nvidia or for AMD to get their driver act together. GTX 1070s can be had for under $200 used, and compare well to GTX 1660 Supers (We got ours before this was an option). If you have the money The 2070 S would be my go to. I could have invested the cost of the expensive fans and CPU cooler to a faster video card or 3900x, but having a system that's quiet, cool, and fast is important to me.Here's to hoping Ryzen continues down this path!

Over a week in. Been a good CPU!

  Bought this over the 3800X because of reviewers like Steve Burke who showed that real-world performance was 1-2% difference. It has a lower TDP than the 3800X which has almost nothing to do with power consumption so I don't even know why they emphasize that in marketing materials.--The Wraith Prism cooler--Main thing to really review here is the stock cooler which is awesome. I've never kept on a stock cooler. I did with this CPU.  With good case cooling you can get to within 100mhz of max these chips can OC  (before going into the Twilight Zone) with the stock cooler. It also looks really nice too. I put down some Noctua NT-H1 that I had instead of the included compound.Comparison benches of the cooler on various sites and YT channels show that it performs on-par with 3rd party air cooling. It even comes within 5C of the Noctua NT-D15. This was great to see because I cannot find my Hyper 212 EVO adapters anywhere. It's been sitting on an Intel chip for the past 5 years. That right there saved me about $40. The bad thing is it's LOUD. With a large tower cooler a variable speed fan is not really even necessary. I kept my old 212 EVO quite cool with up to +1.2GHZ OC at a constant quiet 1200 RPM with a 120mm. That's where a tower cooler will really benefit you.--RGB--The RGBs on the cooler look nice but I need to use the USB 2.0  header in order to get full use out of it because the 12V LED plug they also include is not for ARGB, so all I can do with it is control fan lights with static, breathing, and color change. The rings and AMD logo will just sit on default. Because of this I can't sync it through with my motherboard's software (Gigabyte Fusion) if I want all the RGB options. I don't know why they didn't make it compatible with 5V ARGB, which would allow our motherboard software sync and have more control. RGB/LED really needs standardization if companies plan to continue that route. Probably not AMD's fault here. It's a nice addition.--Overclocking--No point in getting an unlocked CPU without getting some free performance out of it!Overclocking is... interesting. I'm familiar with Intel OCing but AMD Ryzen is a different beast. Intel is pretty much: ""If you have the cooling, keep jumping up the voltage."" This yields in really good OCs on Intel, well past 1GHz over stock for everyday use. AMD has mostly automated the process. The OC is enabled by default through Precision Boost (not the same as Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO)). The difference between PB and PBO is that PBO will raise the motherboard's power limits but it DOES NOT raise the CPU's PB thermal throttle limit. PB is an algorithm that will adjust each core clock until it reaches some magical limit. AMD hasn't published the thermal numbers of what that limit is. But it's far and away better than an all-core OC which is terrible on Ryzen 3000 series. Out of the box it gets 4.225 GHz for me under load which is close to that 4.300 threshold where many people start seeing instability. Temps approach 60C there.  Not bad for a STOCK cooler. Use PBO to get a little more (maybe). In addition you could drop some voltages and get really cool with only a minimal clock loss in PBO (I was doing 4.190) at 55C max. You can OC the oldschool way if you want but don't expect a significant performance increase, even with liquid nitrogen. The biggest benefit for manual overclocking is power efficiency and a less sensitive clock changing. The AMD Ryzen Master software is nice and allows for different OC profiles, such as Gaming which will only activate in games.--TL;DR--TL;DR: Incredible and beautiful stock cooler, but is a jet turbine. The default-enabled Precision Boost will not be far from max these chips can really OC to. Basically a set and forget OC if that's what you want.

I’m very happy with my new Ryzen 7 3700X
","

  I recently decided to update my computer system. As an IT professional over a long number of years I was always in the Intel camp and that suited me well as Intel provided performance and stability. At a few businesses we tried AMD’s early on and encountered heat issues so generally stayed with Intel. Now, being retired and technology having progressed well beyond what my then current system contained, it was time for a change. I did my research and given the budget and requirements I set, there was a clear leaning towards AMD. The Ryzen 7 3700X was a huge step up for me and given that it was to be a multipurpose system with gaming, video and audio editing I was excited to experience the results. I went with a B450 motherboard and decent graphics card. This combination along with lots of RAM and a fast M.2 SSD has produced an impressive computer. I’m very happy with the Ryzen 7 3700X. It was a breeze to install and performs amazingly well no matter what I throw at it. For the money it was clearly the right choice for me.

I LOVED THIS RYZEN 7 CPU & WON'T SAY A BAD THING ABOUT IT!
","

  For my first computer builds in a LONG TIME, i brought the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor and I was satisfied at the time. Now I'm new to the whole Ryzen family of processors. I was an INTEL Fanboy. I heard so many good things about the Ryzen that when it came time to replace my four computers with five new ones I gave Ryzen a try starting with this AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor.The AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor  was child's play to install unlike INTEL. I did not use the stock cooler/ I went with a bigger air cooled solution. CPU temps were a frosty 34 C at idle and 52 under gaming load at 80 FPS. I was playing old video games like RAGE 1. The biggest system demands in RAGE 1 come during racing. The strength of your rig determines how well the cars handle. On the Ryzen 7 Rage 1 Car handling was good with all settings max tweaked.I have the money and can afford it so I wondered if using the RYZEN 9 CPU would improve performance. I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE RYZEN 9XT AND RYZEN 9X. Cenabench R20 gave it awesome scores and Rage 1 blew me away with its improvements. I must say however if you are on a budget AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor will definitely get the gaming job done on any well considered PC build. Performance with a AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor will be very good. There shouldn't be a game you can't play and enjoy due to lack of computer resources in a properly configured system.Your system using AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor is NOT an elite system but, it is better than most medium range slightly older gaming rigs you might find. The AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor is a hearty beast if you treat it right. To paraphrase Todd Howard of Bethesda ""It just works.""

Ryzen and AMD FTW
","

  This is my second Ryzen build and I'm very happy with both.  Buying a CPU is pretty straight forward, just get the fastest one for the money you want to spend.  Today, that's usually a Ryzen chip.  Also, I like the air coolers that come with the units.  They keep the CPU sufficiently cool as long as you're not trying to seriously overclock.  The RGB fan looks good in a clear case, too.  I've got the Ryzen mounted in an X570 motherboard with 32GB RAM running Win10 and have not noted any issues with office/game software so far.  Inserting the chip in the motherboard just requires you to match the appropriate corners and make sure the chip's pins drop into the holes (may take a very gentle nudge with a finger).  The fan comes equipped with thermal compound, which is nice.  **The fan's thermal paste is not protected by anything other than the plastic tray the fan ships in.**  DO NOT place the fan down on anything other than that tray or the Ryzen chip.  Getting the fan clips to properly grip the mount retains before locking it down is a little tricky, but not all that bad.  There are two small cords for the RGB that are best plugged in before you lock down the fan.  Just identify the one you need, remove the appropriate (and very small) rubber cover on the fan's base and plug it into one of the motherboards RGB outlets.  My only regret is that I needed this computer before Ryzen came out with the next generation chips in mid-2020.  Oh well, it won't kill me to do a third Ryzen build.

Unbeatable Value!!

  First, I bough this in replacement to a 10700k that wasn't working (long story...). Unable to find the intel CPU at stock, I decided to go with the 3700x, especially for the value and...I am glad that I make this choice!This is my first AMD CPU, I was afraid of a lot of things, but everything went smoothly. The package was in perfect state, thank you Amazon for listening to my previous feedback about international packages, very satisfied this time. I got the included game without any problem, waiting for it to release now. Zero RAM issue, and this one is a solid piece of hardware. No need to OC, mine boost very well, maybe I got lucky with silicone lottery. Coupled with an old GTX 1070 from my Dell OEM and hoping to be able to get a 3070 or 3080 (in actual state, a far dream due to stock issues). Compared to my previous i7 8700 (non k), the gaming experience is a lot better because I never close my other apps due to work.Is I have to find cons. the only thing that annoy me a little is idle temperature being around 50, but it's really just a detail, far from being a deal breaker. Especially since at 100% load the temp is 77 deg and in gaming I have yet to see it reaching 70 deg with my Arctic freezer esports 34 duo.Pros:- Good performance- Included cooler- Included game- PCIe 4- Incredible value- Good thermals in gaming (compared to my previous CPU)Cons:- Nothing for now.Average:- IDLE voltage and temp (maybe it's the mobo?)

  Great chip for the price, amazing value. Only reason I'm not giving 5/5 is that this thing runs pretty hot. I have an aio and good airflow but from scouring the internet I believe it's a fact most will have to accept. If you're like me coming from Intel and used to colder temps of sub 30s idle, 50-60 load prepare for the heatwave (40-50 idle, 60-75 load)

I found the most unreliable processor on the market
","

  I do believe I found the most unreliable processor on the market. I am on my Fourth replacement processor from AMD and every single one has caused kernel failures and power loss at random moments.I'm using brand new motherboard, ram, and power supply. All are either on the list of supported hardware from AMD or are considered stable and fully compatible with the 3000 series processors.all my hardware diagnostics check out. All of the voltages check out. I have tried all the quick fixes provided by AMD and other sources online. None of them work and this issue continuesI also bought a replacement 2000 series processor just to see if it was the motherboard. It runs like a champ with no issues for hours and hours and hours.While I am happy for everyone who has been able to get a stable version of this processor I cannot endorse it or give any positive feedback.I know AMD makes a good product because I've been using them for over a decade. This is the first time I've ever had a processor fail so miserably even after being replaced!

Absolute beast with great cooler
","

  The processor just shreds any task I throw at it. I think everybody knows the performance is amazing. My real main concern was the Wraith Prism cooler that came with it. So far I've been pleased with the performance of the cooler. It's not as good as some top of the line aftermarket cooler, but it keeps my cpu in safe temps during benchmarking no problem. Idle temps are not as great... 50-60 c.  But I did some research and am finding this processor idles kind of high anyway, and that it's the max temp you really need to know about. I've never gone above 84 and that was with prime 95.Just don't forget it has a little switch on the fan to switch between normal or high mode. I just leave mine on high and it works great and isn't too loud. The RGB looks great with my white meshify-c build.Overall this processor is excellent and the cooler is more than up for the task. AMD wouldn't be giving you this cooler if it were not sufficient, unless you are doing some crazy overclocking.

Great all-around workhorse CPU
","

  I bought this processor as an upgrade to my previous Ryzen 2700x. Even with the same amount of cores, the Zen 2 architecture of the 3700x brought with it a considerable uptick in performance in comparison to the previous gen Zen+ part. I've seen a marked improvement when it comes to frame rate in most games.My use case could be considered a bit unusual, as I typically run a couple VMs on my machine while I play games at the same time. Even with said VMs running, the 16 threads of the 3700x make sure that I don't really notice any sort of performance degradation in my normal desktop workload.Granted, there are some downsides to this processor. Gaming performance isn't top of the heap, as Intel still has the lead there, but the lead is slowly becoming negligible over time. Also, memory performance, while improved over the previous generation, can still be a little finicky. I've had multiple occasions where my Samsung B-die memory would lock itself to 1866MHz and wouldn't keep at its rated 3200MHz speed without a BIOS reset. Speaking of, BIOS support during the first few months of the Zen 2 generation was absolutely terrible. I couldn't run Destiny 2 for at least a month. This is all resolved now, but I thought it was worth noting.Overall, the Ryzen 7 3700x is an amazing processor for the price. It isn't the best on the market, but you certainly won't be let down by it, especially after price cuts and BIOS optimizations.

Thermal paste is way too sticky and will cause problems if you need to remove the cooler.
","

  The thermal paste that is pre-applied to the cooler is so sticky that when I tried to remove the cooler, it pulled the CPU out of the socket even though the CPU was firmly latched in the socket.  Because there is no way to rotate the cooler due to poor choice of fastening hardware, the only way to get the cooler off with the sticky thermal paste is to tilt the cooler and because the CPU came out of the socket with the cooler, the CPU pins ended up getting bent during the cooler removal.  I recommend removing the past and using something different or never attempt to remove the cooler.

  I've been buying and using Intel CPU's for as long as I can remember, but with the current state of the CPU market, it was extremely compelling to go AMD for my rig upgrade. After all, I've been using an i5-3470 since it came out in 2012... yes 2012.This CPU checks all the boxes in terms of performance, power consumption, heat generation, etc. For more detailed reviews, there are plenty of resources out there in the web. I'll pair this with an AMD GPU down the road, but in the meantime, it's paired with a GTX 1060 and there's no game at the moment that can make it break a sweat @ 1080p. (I also need a new monitor to even justify this much power, but I'll also get to that later).If you are on the fence, don't be... get this CPU, you won't regret it.

  This is an awesome processor. I don't have it overclocked yet, but I eventually will. The stock Wraith heat sink and fan is pretty large. It keeps my system around 40C-50C at idle. It's usually in the low 40s, though. Actually, I have a few programs open, but nothing heavy. I have not gamed with it yet, but people say it is a fantastic experience. Installing the heat sink was a little tricky, but that's probably due more to the motherboard than the heat sink.This is a very fast, affordable CPU. AMD has been been making great strides. Get a motherboard that allows you to upgrade to a Ryzen 9 and you'll be set for at least 10 years!Edit: I do have a case with three fans - one intake and two vent fans. This helps keep the system cooler.

AMD Does the Job Right

  After years of Intel I joined the AMD club about a year ago with a Rizen 3700U based laptop. When it came time to build my engineering workstation for school and work I opted to keep using Rizen 7 and found this to be just the right fit. At some point I will upgrade to Rixen 9 but for the price point to performance value this is perfect for now. I installed this CPU on a B550 system running on an NVME drive and the latest Windows 10 Pro. I work with general computer processing, CAD software and some gaming for fun. I initially had issues with the system crashing unannounced. But after a week of troubleshooting the system as a whole I found the Aorus BIOS was running the CPU at its Max clock speed by default, which is unlocked for overclocking. I'm still using the stock air cooler provided which wasn't able to keep up with the overclocking with high CPU work. A few quick BIOS tweaks and it's been flawless since.

  The CPU is absolutely awesome, such a great value for the money. I have throw all my games at it on maximum settings (running 1440p, 144hz monitor with G-sync) and it can handle them with complete ease. The stock cooler, the wraith prism, looks absolutely incredible. It comes with 2 separate detachable wires for RGB, one for the mobo RGB headers and one is a USB controller so you can use the wraith prism app to control it. It has 3 separate controllable rgb areas, the logo, the ring, and the fan. There are really awesome effects to choose from and I cant stop looking at it. I wasnt even going for RGB in my build but this came with it anyway and I'm very pleased, looks amazing.Oh and the most important part, the temps. Temps are quite low!! I BARELY ever hit 70 degrees, with the occasional very temporary burst up to 72 degrees. Games run pretty consistently at 69-70 for hours at a time, just using the stock cooler, stock fan settings and the thermal paste that came pre-applied. Guys there is really absolutely no reason to pay money for any different cooler with this thing! The processor is amazing, looks amazing, price was good, couldn't be happier with my choice to run with this.I'm pairing it with Asus Tuf X570 board and the Gigabyte Windforce 2080Ti 11G graphics card (with triple fans) and GSKill Ripjaws 3600mz ram. All these components are working very well together with no bottle necks.

Nice upgrade from a 6 year old gaming build
","

  -Skip down for review-Before I say my piece about this chip, let me just say thank you AMD for all the years of hard work in making the Zen architecture happen. Without you guys, there wouldn't be any competition. Intel will certainly be thinking twice in the shady business they've been doing with their line ups from haswell, to caby lake, coffee lake, etc etc. It's so confusing.This AMD chip is most certainly a great upgrade for people who haven't upgraded their computer in 6 years. To tell you my story I was using the intel core i7 as my daily driver for gaming and is still going. I have not used AMD since owning a Compaq laptop and Athlon 64 was still in the making. It was a pain! I suffered a lot of crashes, BSOD, and driver issues for no reason. Last week, I decided that going for Zen 2 was my next upgrade since I decided to be open minded and give AMD another chance. will say that I do not regret it.Now to be critical about the product, it unfortunately requires tweaking from either the bios and/ or using the AMD Ryzen Software because of the temperature issue it's causing. I'm not sure it's the firmware to where core clock speeds are just aggressive or there hasnt been enough tests done to where there's a sweet spot in the temperatures and gamers can have enough headroom. Despite the transistors being 7 nm and the heatsink being copper, it should NOT be putting out that much heat. Also I noticed that not many reviewers except I think this is very important... I'm not too big on AMD making their RGB 4 pin cables proprietary only for the Wraith coolers. Consumers should have a choice in replacing their cables in case for any reason the cable breaks or they lost it... For all those reasons it deserve 4 stars until all these problems are rectified!!

  I upgraded to this from a FX 8350 and it's so much better and I've had zero issues with this CPU.  I have mainly been tweaking my GPU so I don't have anything to say about that.  The stock cooler is really loud and the rgb component of the cooler doesn't always sync with my ASUS Tuf X570 mobo.  Sometimes the rgb is on and cycling between colors as normal and then the next boot there's only the stable rgb leds on in the middle.  Really inconsistent.Running the stock cooler in my NZXT H710 case was getting me ~70C just browsing chrome and watching videos not to mention the fan is really loud.

  Upgraded from an i5 4670k to this Ryzen 7 3700x and I've been very impressed by the overall performance increase. This cpu has no problems encoding or re-encoding videos on handbrake. Videos that are about 20 mins long that are 4k that need to be re-encoded with very best settings and 2x pass on Handbrake would take me about 8 hours on my i5 4670k but with the Ryzen 7 3700x it makes it only 2 hours and 17 minutes. That's pretty amazing. I haven't been able to test this out on many pc games just yet because my hard-drive is small at 140 gigs and I'm going to be upgrading to a 2tb hard-drive soon but as you can tell from YouTube videos online this is pretty good for gaming. Definitely an upgrade from my i5 4670k since that cpu came out back in 2013. My old i5 4670k was rated at 84 watts which isn't bad but the Ryzen 7 3700x is rated at 65 watts! And if you're not doing intensive stuff at times it's barely using any watts from what Open Hardware Monitor was showing me. I think this cpu right now is the best bang for the buck since you get 8 cores to future proof yourself and this cpu is more than enough for gaming, editing, encoding, and streaming. If you stream on twitch, YouTube, or any other place this cpu should be able to handle almost anything thrown at it at 1080p at least and higher preset in OBS.

An upgrade worth buying

Cpu was great, ran all the games I needed it to, but couldn’t really multitask which to me was a bummer.  There’s plenty of great options out there that will smack the 6700k. I mainly looked at the i9-9900k, Ryzen 9 3900x, and Ryzen 7 3700x as upgrade worthy CPU’s to buy. Read reviews, forums and even watched YouTube videos putting these cpus against each other in various scenarios. They’re all very very close in terms of FPS in game and can even handle streaming and gaming at the same time at 1080p.  The Ryzen 7 3700x, at the time I bought it, was roughy 280 USD. Doubling the specs my 6700k had I thought I might want to go with the 3900x, and ended up not purchasing it. Let me say that the 3700x will throw you for a loop and is more than capable of handling almost anything you throw at it. Before I could barely stream and play video games, since I use one PC instead of 2. Now I can stream, play any game, and listen to Spotify while only using about 75-80% of the CPU’s capability. I drop maybe 10-20 FPS in game and the only reason I can tell a difference is with the FPS counter on my screen.  This is literally the best bang for your buck CPU out right now. Yes, it’s not the strongest on paper against intel CPU’s, but real world tests this CPU will outperform the i9-9900k with multithread performance.  If you’re on the fence about buying the Ryzen 7 3700x you will not be disappointed at all. Literally the best bang for your buck CPU you can get at the moment.

Ryzen 7 3700X Performances/Not reaching the advertise clock speed
","

  PROS:  For those of you who also use their PC for work, content creation, or essentially any productivity task that demands a fast CPU, in those scenarios this new Ryzen 7 3700X will best for you and value.CONS : You mainly game? You will see gaming performance being head to head with i7 8700K (not 9th gen) Intel cpus. Basically you are buying something for game that was like 1 or 2 years ago.....Price over Future proof not the best.Seem to falsely state they hit the full clock speed when it does not. Not Performing what it state to be also.ANDThere are issues that can be fixed by AMD, but as usual it require some performance loss.Overall Review: I would not count on it if a overblown fan say it better than the competitor in gaming performance

Strong processor with sweet lighting as bonus

  Did a lot of research on processors to replace my Intel 4790k so I could play MS Flight Sim. Paired with a nice mobo, I've been very happy with this processor - for the price it has very good performance. I had an AMD machine 20 years ago and was leery b/c it wasn't very stable, but they really have it all together now and give Intel a run for their money. I would gladly buy this processor again and recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful processor at a more reasonable price.

Good CPU. AMD Linux Virtualization Capable.
","

  I've been an Intel consumer for years now and had always avoided AMD because of its inferiority in the virtualization department. However, these new Ryzen cpus are quite nice. I really love the stock cooler that comes with it and I'm already noticing a speed improvement in most of my day to day tasks from my old i5-3570k. Albeit that's not a high bar to reach, but it's still nice.The biggest sticking point for me when buying this was making sure that it could handle Linux virtual machines done through hyper-v clients. The great news is that it can and also has SMT support that Intel removed from its i7 processors to hide behind the premium i9s. Needless to say, I'm very happy with my purchase on these fronts.But no processor is perfect. Here are the cons:1. Please, AMD, use LGA socket types and not PGA or come up with a better way to secure your cpu in place. There's nothing more heart-attack inducing when building a computer than accidentally prying a processor up out of the socket because it is only held in by friction instead of clamps. Stop doing this to us.2. This cpu is not the most budget friendly option for gaming. It can do gaming, but gamers should look toward intel for the best possible frames and speed. That said, that's all Intel is beating AMD at these days. If you use your computer for anything other gaming the majority of the time, I recommend a ryzen cpu. If not, you should go for a recent i5 and overclock it. You'll get plenty of speed out of that thing for games.

AMD is back baby
","

  I haven't had an AMD CPU since the Athlon 2200+ or something or other. It's been so long I forgot even the exact model I had. Now with this Zen 2 architecture I can confidently say AMD has come back into the scene in full force. This CPU handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. In games it barely cracks 20% utilization (Jedi Fallen Order, Outer Worlds, League of Legends, Civ5, etc.)It's weird but to me the best part is that the cooler that comes in the box is perfectly adequate. It doesn't even touch 70C when running CB15 back to back to back, or gaming. It looks great too, with built in addressable RGB lighting.AMD really hit it out of the park with this chip, I can't wait to see what they keep doing from here on out. Intel really needs to bring something worthwhile to the table soon because right now they're looking pretty foolish.

Beast! (But runs a bit hot?)

  Pros:- I haven't been able to peg it back with anything yet.- great price.Cons:- originally bought a low profile Noctua cooler that came highly recommended (because people say that the default cooler is really loud) but that couldn't keep up (Was hitting 98C regularly). Went back to the original Wraith Prism cooler (which actually isn't that loud in the first place) and used Arctic Silver 5 and temps dropped but it can still hit 93C when gaming. 81C is usually the average though.

Great CPU but check your motherboard!
","

  Coming from an i3-4160, this is night and day for me, but be ready for a couple things.1. If you're using previous generation motherboard, you likely will need a bios update to use this cpu. If you don't have access to a cpu to do this update, go to AMD's support site, they can temporarily ship you a cpu to update your motherboard bios.2. This thing with the stock cooler idles higher than what I would be comfortable with. It seems to idle between the 40's and 50's, and I've seen it as high as 73C under load. It's not terrible, but still makes me a little nervous, and I would highly recommend you monitor your cpu's temperature every so often.EDIT: It turns out my motherboard was letting the cpu run as close to the boost clock as it could (I got to roughly 4.3 Ghz), and disabling that made temperatures much more comfortable (~35C idle and ~55 under full load).3. If you're going to just be gaming, get a 3600 or 3600x, the extra cores aren't going to help you a lot, and it saves you a good bit of money that you can put into something else (like a better GPU).Other than it running hotter than I would like it to (EDIT: by default on my specific motherboard, check yours), and the hassle of updating a motherboard (which can be avoided entirely if you use a newer motherboard with the x570 chipset or similar), this is a great CPU for the money.

  An absolute joy to use and build with. Fantastic load times, multitasking,  and fps. It never gets bogged down on tired.  Just do not keep the wraith cooler. I expected way too much from the stock cooler and got temps of 80-84 playing Outer Worlds. Tie this powerful cpu with a mid to an upper level Be Quiet cooler and you will do fine. Works excellent with a 570x motherboard. I wanted more than my Ryzen 5  but didn't want to spend big bucks on the 9 and got everything I had hoped for.  So glad I didn't waste money on an overpriced non-overclockable Intell 9900 as my benchmarks were even with and I9900 and sometimes better even without overclocking. It can run warm so get a great air cooler or seriously water cool if you are gonna overclock.

This thing is insane!

  I had a Ryzen 5 2400G, which I bought as a starter CPU until I could pair it with a graphics card. I put a GTX 1660, and waited until I could upgrade CPU.I upgraded the 2400G to this 3700x, and oh boy! oh boy!My computer went nuts! everything was crazy fast, I couldn't believe the difference.My 2400G was NOT slow. It was an excellent CPU/APU to start with.  I mostly do content creation, video editing from a 1080p camcorder, and transcoding from one format to another, and livestream. So CPU speed is crucial as well as cores/threads.When I went with the 3700x, My PC went bannanas. It went from doing an hour transcoding to less than 20 minutes. No exaggeration here. I even logged benchmarked with each CPU to see the difference. Here are some numbers, same system, same graphics card, just swapped the CPU (16GB 3200mhz Ram, MSI GTX 1660, MSI B450 Gaming Plus Motherboard, Sabrent 500GB NVME SSD):benchmark  2400G OC @ 4.0  3700x Stock7Zip  24,047  63,831Cinebench R15  878  2,061Cinebench R20  1,998  4,741CPUz  2,488  5,552(I only included the benchmarks that have more impact from the CPU swap, other benchmarks focus on the GPU and there was a difference, just not as big as these)My conclusions:If you are going to game only, web browse HD or 4K video playback, or do class, a 2400G paired with a decent graphics card will give you a great experience.If you are going to stream games or do content creation, or multitask when the PC is doing something heavy like transcoding, the 3700x is the champion. At stock settings there is no need to OC, since PBO2 in this cpu is so good there is no need.For web browsing, playing low end games or HD video playback, 3700x is faster but way overkill. 2400G is more than enough.

CPU Perfect! Cooler is okay.
","

  This is by far the best computer processor I have ever used, it is fast and powerful. I have used it for 3D modeling, video editing, and gaming; It has surpassed all my expectations. Although AMD is releasing new processors soon, this model is still very strong and at a great price, which may drop post 5000 release. The only problem I had with this processor was not the CPU itself, but the RGB Wraith Cooler. There are so many problems with this cooler that I can't recommend it. Yes, it works and I am in fact still using mine because I didn't budget for one, but I do plan on replacing it soon. Here is everything I found wrong with it:- It is a pain to install, especially for beginners. Rather than opting for screws or push pins, AMD designed a strange hook mechanism that is absolutely terrible. When installing the cooler, it feels like everything is going to break, and although I know I installed it correctly it didn't feel right.- It is LOUD! It's not unbearable, but it is annoying. Any time I open up a new app or do something that puts a tiny strain on the CPU, the Wraith speeds up a lot.- The RGB is a mess! The Prism Wraith has 3 individual RGB lights: the fan, the ring, and the logo. HOWEVER, only the fan can be controlled with external software (AURA SYNC, iCue, etc). If you wish to control all three LEDs, you have to use a separate app from Cooler Master, which requires you to attach a separate cable to one of your internal USB headers. Not to mention, you cannot use the Cooler Master software at the same time as another program, and they are not compatible. So you can either control just the fan LED, or you can control all three with a USB cable and sucky Cooler Master bloatware.- The cooling isn't very good. At idle it is fine, but gaming or using heavy software it just doesn't keep up very well.TL:DR  - Buy this CPU if you need a good CPU and you don't want to wait for 5000, but budget for a better cooler the Wraith is very disappointing.

  I got this for gaming and photo upgrading as an upgrade for a 3.2 ghz 4-core processor. Installation was as expected, and particularly speeds for exporting photos and doing large edits in Photoshop improved dramatically. I do no overclocking, and it works plenty good enough for my uses without it. I'm not a huge user of RGB, but it's easy enough to set up on the stock cooler, and it does look pretty nice.I did get notably lower temps (5 C) when I swapped out the thermal paste, but I don't know whether that's an issue with the stock thermal paste or due to me messing up the CPU cooler installation and needing to reseat it.

Best Performance Without Killing Your Electric Bill
","

  If you are willing to pay more than $200 for a CPU (but less than $500) this really hits the sweet spot for price/performance. (It was just under $300 when I bought it.) I do a lot of photo and video editing, as well as run long complicated mathematical models. So I am using a lot of cores for long periods of time.  This is currently the highest performing Ryzen processor that runs at 65w. Everything above this draws nearly twice the power. To put this another way, anything more powerful than this chip would add another $50/month to my electric bill because my computer is working constantly. Just something to keep in mind when you are comparing prices. Of course, I am writing this in October of 2020 and soon AMD will introduce a whole new set of CPUS and we will have to start the price/performance comparisons all over again. But for now - this is the best bang for buck if you need a lot of cores and want to be as miserly as possible with the power cost.

  I am in love with this. First time going with AMD, no regrets. This thing is FAST (I came from an Intel I7 4770). I can't seem to max out my cpu usage. It does run pretty hot compared to what I'm used to, but the cooler it comes with actually is fairly decent, even when massively overclocking (4.4ghz on all cores at 1.4v seems to be stable, but that gets too hot, I wouldn't recommend anything over about 4.3ghz at 1.35v or so, at most), and the cooler looks really really good (has a ""mirage"" effect that is mesmerizing, never seen anything like it). One big problem with the cooler though, is when using with Aura Sync through a motherboard RGB header, you cannot controller the outer ring leds or the logo leds separately from the fan leds, nor can you use the mirage effect. You have to have it plugged in to a usb header (cables are included) and use the Cooler Master Wraith Prism software (which can at least allow you to pass the controls on to Razer Synapse). Overall, I love it.

Mostly running Lightroom and Photoshop but this chip QUICKLY chews through everything I throw at it. I don't game on it so I can't comment on that aspect, but it's very stable on my X470 board. It's quirky compared to older chips....spikey voltage and temps, and the Wraith prism fan spins up quite a bit (I'll fix that with an adjusted fan profile soon) but I'm just relaxing and enjoying it rather than worrying about voltage and temps.....all are within spec.

  Gotta say, AMD came out swinging hard when they released their 3000 series. Had this chip in my computer for over a month now, and it's been going insanely strong. Render times for my YouTube videos ends up being almost half the time it used to take on my old 2600, and when i'm streaming using CPU encoding, this CPU barely even notices the load. Heck the only bottleneck i've had streaming is Comcast's ""great"" services. Managed to boost the cores to 4GHz steady, idle temps staying between 35-38 C depending on room temp. Even under load it maybe reaches the 70s? Again depends on how warm my room gets. If you're looking for an upgrade for your work station, this chip will fit in perfectly.

  If you're looking at these you probably have an idea of what you're looking for. I went with the 3700x because it was on sale for $259, which isn't that much above my initial pick of the 3600. I figured why not add a bit more future proofing. On the same logic train ended up grabbing 16GBx2 ram for 32GB total, which for a gaming rig is overkill but with the kid we're doing more videos/video editting so whatever.You can't go wrong with any of the current gen Ryzen. Running Cinebench R20 on loop with Furmark also running, I'm topping out at ~77c (and that's on the 'package' temp which is ~10c higher than the posted CPU temp of ~67c) in a case with kind of substandard ventilation and a 1660 Super blowing hot air around in the vicinity.

  Aloha from Hawaii This CPU is incredible. I paired the 3700x with an Asus strix rog b450f that I also bought from Amazon, from a selling company known as digilet. The mobo I paired with this incredible cpu was Ryzen 3000 ready, which means I didn't need to update the bios in order for this CPU to work out of the box with this particular. For cooling I am using a hyper 212 Evo black edition and I have two fans attached to the cooler. Prior to undervolting the CPU I was getting idle temps in the mid to high 50s and at load mid 80s; which is typical for this processor. After adjusting my voltage in the bios to 1.2 and tinkering with fan curves, my CPU temps are down to about 40 degrees idle and low 60s during load while still hitting a 4.2.mhz overclock. I am not used to seeing high stock voltage of 1.5 and I want my CPU to last long by not making it run too hot. I use my new rig mostly for gaming and streaming and I paired the CPU with a 5700xt msi mech. I love my amd system and it can easily run AAA games in ultra high settings with an FPS of 100+ with no stutters. I'm amazed at the quality and performance of this combo.

  Great CPU! Stays cool and does the job well! The clock speeds vary from 3.4 to 4.4 GHz at times. This is due to the Precision Boost that is on at default to help maximize efficiency and effectiveness. However, if you play video games or use anything that is heavy CPU-wise, I would recommend getting Ryzen Master and setting a manual clock speed, because the CPU will consistently run at 4.4 Ghz and cause some high thermals. Mine got around 60-71C after a few hours for play time (Amazing considering I have an air cooler).  Probably my motherboard as well being a lower quality budget board. It uses half the energy of my old 7700k and runs way cooler for a small cut in core clocks and a big one in thermals. Comparatively, I've used half the KwH compared to my old I7. That's money in my pocket for more later on.

Working like a charm
","

  If you love to game, this CPU is for you!! Easy to install and works like a charm.Positive: Easy install and over all not complications on the first run, even worked with my old windows version without requesting anything else ( updated from a AMD FX8350 to this )Negative: I know that the thermal past comes pre applied on the heat sink but for those who have liquid cooling ( like in my case ), I need to go purchase a new one in any store, which is sad, since it would be better if it comes within the package and not pre applied to the heatsing or alternative solution maybe pre applied to the CPU itself! So remember that if you purchase this, make sure to have thermal past at home, if you want to use your own liquid cooling system instead of the one it comes with!

  I had a Ryzen 3700x for a little over two weeks. It was fast to boot and the gaming performance was great. The Wraith cooler was a bit ostentatious and I would have preferred seeing a more effective cooler paired with CPU. My overall experience with the product was terrible as I kept getting a 'MACHINE_CORE_EXCEPTION' along with a reboot/BSOD. Probably luck of the draw, but I ended up returning the product.AMD Support was quick and knowledgable. However, I feel the company should have done more to keep my business.

Top CPU Recommendation, Very Underpriced for Performance.

  For anyone who isnt dropping $6000 on a PC (or doing like a sub-$500 build) this is pretty much the one and only recommendation I would give someone for a CPU right now. It performs at an extremely high level, and was selling for only $280 when I purchased it. I would expect to spend $400-$500 for the kind of performance that this CPU is putting out.

  Awesome CPU, it worked perfectly right out of the box!  It is overclock-able but with the factory settings with my MSi motherboard it runs generally about 3.6-3.7GHz  and for those of you who are coming from intel, the Ryzen chips act more like a engine in a car they idle at 3.6GHz under low use and rev up to around (for my chip anyway) 4.5-4.6GHz  @ stock settings and voltages as I said with the MSi x570 chipset.  I ran some tests (you can download right from Microsoft website simple render tests, and its scores were extremely impressive it performs at the same level as other CPUs from the 700-1000+ price point.  In my opinion this is the best of the best for sub 1000 dollar possessors at the beginning of 2020.  I should mention I run mine on a EVGA CLC 360mm water cooler with push and pull fans, it idles at 100F  and under full load runs at 135F.

  Its hard to say if its a cpu issue or bios issue but these chips get hot.  Stress testing can bring temps up to 80degree celsius + with liquid cooling at default settings and in the 70s gaming. The performance of this cpu is great but the temps worry me. maybe i have a faulty cpu and should return to amazon but it could be months before a replacement is available. I think this will be a good cpu but currently amd still has some issues to work out.  Apparantly if a promotion releases (borderlands 3 ;-) ) days after you recieve your cpu the promo is not available for your purchase, kind of lame in my opinion. If amd works out the issues with temps and stability i would say this is a 4-5 star product at retail price. ($329)

Amazon CS knows nothing about the game promotion this product was being sold with.
","

  I think it works fine, I am having a problem with video going out randomly, sometimes requiring a reboot sometimes just lasting a few seconds, but that probably has something to do with the AMD video card I bought on a separate order and not the processor. My experience is AMD video drivers are always a little buggy so if I ever track down the problem I expect it will probably be that. They are just killing it so much on processors right now I thought I'd give them another shot with video cards too.The one problem I had with the purchase was it was on the same order as a fire stick that also had a promotion. I didn't receive an email for the associated free game promotion code so I did a chat with CS who gave me the code for the fire stick instead of the processor. You need the processor installed to verify the code so I didn't learn to later that I got the wrong code. I contact cs for the right one and get the run around for 20 minutes, ultimately they know nothing about the promotion even after I show them the sale page with a promotion(not as good of one as the one that was there when I bought it) and don't have a code for me and finally say they are escalating the problem and I will be contacted via email in order to get rid of me, I never receive a follow up email.

All around a good CPU, but with one small complaint
","

  Zen 2, 8 Cores 16 Threads, this thing is THE processor to buy this generation. The only complaint I have about it is the box claims a maximum boost of 4.4GHz, but in practice you will almost never see that. In single core workloads, you might see 4.2-4.3, and worst case scenario multi-threaded loads you might only see 4.0. If you're thinking ""No problem, I'll just overclock it!"", think again. These chips are pretty much at their limit at stock. If you run an exotic cooling setup, you might be able to reach the advertised boost speeds of 4.4GHz, but otherwise you'll be stuck with whatever your particular chip decides is safe. The only things worth overclocking on these chips are the Infinity Fabric and your RAM kit, which will improve performance in games by quite a big margin in some cases (5-25% in depending on the game and your video card). Despite the limited clock speeds, these chips are still pretty stellar. The closest chips in price from Intel right now are the 8700K (6C 12T), and the 9700K (8C 8T), both of which are also good chips, but are nowhere near the raw performance of the 3700X.

Excellent value but remains hot.

  It is a beast in performance, it reaches 4.2 always.I initially bought the AIO (Cooler Master) but then switched back to stick cooler as the difference was negligible.Temperature under AIO- Idle-44°C to 45°C and Under stock cooler- 48-50°CBetter to use a good CPU fan instead which will last longer and no issue of leakage. Cheaper to buy as well.Now installed CPU cooler and temperature is 42°C. ( Cooler Master )My Intel i3 remains much cooler at 34-35 with cooler. ( Basic one )It is now 9 years old and still runs perfect. I just feel Intel although being less power and being more expensive, it is a stable machine.I will still recommend AMD over Intel for the price to performance.It’s just Apple App Store Vs Androids Google Play store.

  First CPU that I have bought that isn't Intel, and I was nervous for sure. But I wouldn't be if I were you, this thing is a beast. I haven't OC'd it but I don't think I will need to because it runs good as it is. I stream games and play 1080p at 144FPS and it works perfectly. Please don't read too much into hardware websites as sometimes they have some bias for Intel. GO FOR IT. TRY AMD. You will not be dissatisfied with this chip.

  I upgraded from the 3200g with my starter build. This CPU blows that out the water. With ryzen master and the prism cooler, I am getting way better frame rates and it stays below 70C.You don't have to overclock too much since there are 8 cores and 16 threads. I run my 4.2 all cores at 1.35V and can play Warzone to Red Dead 2 at great frame rates.Just keep in mind you want to have some good ventilation in your case and a graphics card... and you are good to go!

  If you want value for the money, this processor is definitely it!  The stock cooler it comes with let's me boost to about 4.1ghz max.

  Great performance in games, and for everyday office/multimedia use. Eight cores, and 16 threads so it should be good enough for the next few years. XFR works great when paired with aftermarket cooling, and X570.

  An average of 15% IPC jump with clockspeed improvement. Performs close to a 9900k at $150 less. The Ryzen 3000 series offer so much more value compared to competing products from Intel. The lackluster gaming performance has been improved greatly in this generation of Ryzen chips, providing performance that is slightly behind but close enough to the 9900k in low core performance and exceeding it in all core performance.Neither the 3700x nor 3600 run into any sort of cpu bottleneck at 1080p as long as you're not on a RTX 2080 level graphics card. If you don't have any GPUs at that level or beyond, save yourself some money and get the Ryzen 3000 series, do not over-invest in the 9900k because those those extra performance cannot be realized by your GPU.

Great chip for games.

  This is a great chip for anyone trying to build a gaming pc. It has a lot of power for the price and runs smooth in any situation. The stock cooler keeps it cool in many situations only really warming up to around 55 while playing stressful games while also looking pretty nice. From what I can tell, at 1080 or 1440p, this chip will prevent any bottlenecking for up to a 2080ti. Maybe even a 3080. (Im not too sure) It's a great chip at a great price.

  However just because I experienced no issues doesn't mean you 100% wont. Its the worst thing about buying tech, it either works or it doesn't. You have to make sure your mobo is supporting ryzen 3000 without any issues. Some will still buy mobos with support for ""3000 series cpus"" but you will still experience issues until everything is 100% sorted out. if you want zero issues i recommend getting an x570 mobo and ram from the qvl list.

Excellent multi-purpose mid-high range processor.

  This processor has great multi-tasking performance and also excellent single core performance. The single core performance exceeds the 3900x and with 8 cores that's enough for all of my current and future needs including gaming and developing. I'd say this is the best mid-high range processor on the market as it doesn't go overkill on the cores. Personally I rarely use all 8 cores even during the most intense gaming/developing sessions.

Unacceptable!!!!!! CPU Missing from the package!!!

  Received WITHOUT the processor included. Kind of an important thing to leave out. I knew as soon as I saw the cut label on the packaging before opening that something was not right, and sure enough, my greatest fear came true. I am beyond words right now and completely fumed that I spent over $300 for a fan!! This is utterly, egregiously unacceptable!!

Great CPU for Gaming and Productivity.

  This is the CPU I chose for my first ever build. As of now I have had it for about a month and had encountered no issues. The stock cooler is a solid option for cooling. But if you want to overclock think about an AIO or at least a nice air cooler to replace the one that comes with it. Overall it gets the job done and if you want a good all round CPU then this may be it.

Works great for games, content creation, and BeamNG.Drive!  Beats my old 4790k hands down.
","

  I create content for BeamNG.Drive driving simulator.  From modeling with Maya, to making my own graphics or upgrading existing ones I've made, to using the map editor within the simulator itself, this processor does it all and does it all well.  The system is very fast and I can run up to 20~21 vehicles simultaneously while keeping the game engine running full speed.  Anything over 15~16 vehicles may drop below 30fps though.  20FPS is minimum for full speed, but this is a simulator mind-you, that polls hundreds of points per vehicle 2000 times a second with real-time deformation and soft-body physics, NOT an arcade game.  You need a very strong processor for this simulator.Upgraded from a 4.4ghz i7 4790k from 2014, which I delidded and put liquid metal on, and a 100$ air cooler, just to barely be able to keep heat in check.  For comparison reasons, the 4790k was on a Maximus Hero Z97 motherboard with 32GB DDR3 dual channel 2400mhz, cas latency 11.I only have 3000mhz CL15 memory here (32gb, 2 16gb micron sticks, Crucial Ballastix brand), so it's a little less than the recommended 3200~3600mhz speeds most people will put in, but I got a heck of a deal on it so I couldn't pass it up.  Keep this in mind when buying RAM as you'll want to get as close to (but not over) 3600mhz to keep your Infinity Fabric speeds at their maximum potential, which helps eek out a few more FPS.This absolute floors the 4790k and most comparable intel quad-core i7 chips in multi-tasking or multi-thread aware games and software.  There is to be no comparison what-so-ever here!  If you're on the fence, throw this on any cheap x570 board (I used an AsRock x570 Phantom Gaming 4) as they're all validated with a 16-core behemoth 3950x processor, and enjoy the new-found power that you'll have at your fingertips.I can't say this enough, that for less than the price of an intel too-hot-to-handle 9700k / 9900k, I got a great deal on an 8-core 16-thread processor that overclocks by itself - and a stock cooler that keeps everything under 80c.  In-fact, even when running way too many vehicles for this to handle reasonably (read: even a 7980X would have issue), it DOES NOT and HAS NEVER hit 80C with the stock cooler.  Do your self a favor though and scrape a little of the excess thermal paste off the stock heat-sink after a test-mount... they provide considerably too much.  You only need enough to fill the grooves and imperfections in the metal surfaces, it DOES NOT and SHOULD NOT be opaque, obscuring visibility of the surface it's on!  If you can't see some metal through it, it's too much.  Do a test-mount first though to be sure.The cooler is capable as mentioned above and the mounting is very easy.  Keep in mind the Spire and Steal coolers may mount differently with screws, but this cooler mounted with a standard AMD-style hook-and-clip method, which I like.  So much easier than intel chips with bulky after-market and expensive coolers, or push-pins on OEM ones that never want to stay in if the tower gets bumped, even if you get it mounted right.  The AMD cooler makes an intel cooler look like a cat-toy for my cat.  The cooler also doesn't seem to make really any noise - the noise it does make is just air moving sounds, no roaring, and while you CAN hear it if you try to hear it, it isn't louder than your regular aftermarket video card cooler from one of the major AIB's.A 6~12 minute ultra-compression 7-zip operation on 2~3GB of files takes 40~46 seconds, VS the 4790k's 5~8 minutes or more.  My mind was blown when I saw the zip operation go so fast, I had to double-check my settings.---------------------I DO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROCESSOR NOT BOOSTING AS HIGH AS IT SHOULD.  This is likely because I was smart enough to not only scrape off 75% of the included thermal paste after a test-mount, but I also didn't toy around in BIOS settings with things except telling the memory to use 'XMP' profile to get it's rated out-of-box speed.---------------------My only regret?  Not upgrading on release day, and not buying the 12-core.  I'll snag a 16-core next year when they get discounted if they ever do when the 4xxx series hits.So all in all, this is amazing.  In 25 years of toying around with computer guts since the AM486 or i486 DX/2 66 was a good PC, I don't think I've ever had this big of a jump in speed.  Sure, single-core performance apples to apples isn't that big of a jump, but there was still a good 30~35% gain off a 4790k, and the multi-core performance is at-least 2.5x~3x or more - especially in ZIP operations, rendering, graphics work, video encoding etc.The new 1.0.0.3ABBA BIOS has released as of the 10th, and while most games and OS tasks only see a 1~2% gain, one game such as 'Total Warhammer 2' I believe it was called, saw about a 10% fps gain.  I have not updated my BIOS since release day as the system works fine, but that last bit was gleaned from reviews on YouTube.I wish you the best - and if you're on the fence and run BeamNG.Drive, get this and you will have no regrets - or get a 3900x / 3950x for even more vehicles simulated at the same time.Motherboard used - Asrock Phantom Gaming 4 non-wifi version.Used Micron-sourced Crucial Ballastix 3000mhz CL15 memory in dual-channel, 2 sticks of 16gb.Used the stock cooler.  Used a 'used but good' full tower Fractal Define XL case I got at auction for 50$.Used a SeaSonic power supply and an RX 480 8gb video card (this video card while long in the tooth, will get me by for now, it's got some life left yet).Tested on valid, legit Windows 10 Pro.  DID NOT use/install Ryzen 'Master' Software to test, for what it's worth.

Useless because no motherboards support it on Amazon
","

  I was excited to switch to AMD from Intel for the first time, seeing as the 3700x appeared to be a clear choice for video editing work, but there doesn't appear to be ANY matx motherboard (or any other type?) for that matter on Amazon that specifically says it supports Gen 3 AMD processors.Every AM4 motherboard says it supports Gen 1 and 2. Not 3. I'm not going to buy an older AMD chip and to update th bios to run this one (don't even know how to do that!), so this entire generation of processors are completely useless because there aren't any motherboards that support them straight out of the box.Back to intel! Shame, was looking to switch to red team. Oh well...

No compromises at 65 Watts? Yes, please...
","

  This is my first desktop upgrade in eight years. I wanted to build a system that is thoroughly modern, has system bandwidth for days, and a processor that can bang out work with the regularity of Dwarven smiths. I got it. The 3700X is, as the heart of such a computer, a gem. Not only does it support PCIe 4 on an X570 chipset and much faster RAM (not overclocked, btw,) than its' Intel competitors, it has the guts to push some of the best graphics cards on the market to high frame rates at 1440p and even 4K without overclocking.It took me all of three minutes to install windows on my new m.2 PCIe 4 hard drive, and every task I've performed with the new PC has been seamless, quick and horrifyingly simple. I get that, over time, life should be much easier than it was in the days of troubleshooting driver compatibility issues for hours just to bootstrap your system into lacklustre performance, but when Windows and all drivers, big games and such take less than fifteen minutes to install? Welcome to the future!I just wonder, since all modern internals are lit up like rainbow Christmas trees, if computers in two to three years will remove all lights 'n window panels to internals, and be marketed as ""stealth"" for a premium upgrade price... Probably accompanied by a changeover back to beige plastic as the only color you can buy a case in. I won't care so much if processors keep getting this much better generation on generation... I like the future!

Good CPU, but not as advertised.
","

  Switched from an I7 7700k to this after seeing the multicore benches. For less than what I paid for the I7 2 years ago I have essentially double the mc speed. That being said, The I7 worked fine out of the box, as advertised if not better and required no memory tweaking or painstaking hours in the bios. The same cannot be said for this CPU. This, and the majority of the new ryzen processors do not meet the boost clocks that were adverised, often up to .5 ghz which was the case for me as well. They have released one bios update for agesa and between that, RAM timing calculations, precision boost overdrive tweaking, cooling upgrades, hours of research and time spent in the bios I still do not boost above 4.2 ghz. She runs and benches great, but still not the end product I and everyone else were told they were going to receive. They denied the issue altogether initially which just makes the whole advertisement feel like a lie, why even claim that at all if you cant back it up? These cpus rarely hit advertised boost clocks even when cooled with liquid nitrogen by professional overclockers. That being said I am still happy with it overall but were I more aware of the issue before my bestbuy return period ended I would have returned it and waited for 4xxx series.

Much better price/performance compared to Intel
","

  Recently I've gone toward the AMD platform for my computing needs...this includes laptops I've purchased over the past couple of years, which are all AMD Ryzen-based now. 10 years ago I wouldn't have considered purchasing AMD over Intel, but the Ryzen platform of CPU's has simply excelled in performance, proven by benchmarks and user feedback. Performance combined with the price points on AMD's chips are edging them above their competition. Intel will have to play catch-up...Intel will likely catch up and exceed AMD in performance soon enough, but consumers will undoubtedly have to pay a heftier price for it.I purchased the AMD Ryzen 3700x in combination with the ASUS ROG Strix-E x570 motherboard to replace my existing Intel Xeon/ASUS Rampage Formula motherboard/CPU combo. The Xeon combo was nearly 12 years old (bought it new in '08), but still hanging in there as far as running everyday tasks adequately. It was time for an upgrade...the 3700x/ROG Strix-E x570 board consumes less power and definitely resulted in a day vs night performance gain across the board. It has plenty of horsepower for high-end gaming as well as running CPU-intensive applications.I recommend using NVME SSD storage as your boot drive with this combo, especially considering the Ryzen Gen 3 CPU's are PCIe 4.0 compatible, it's lightning fast. Paring Gen 3 Ryzen CPU's with the x570 chipset is a must. Go with 3200Mhz DDR4 SDRAM (or faster) for best performance with this CPU. I can't justify the $70-$80 extra for the 3800x when the specs and benchmarks vs. the 3700x are so similar. I may just keep the 3700x/ROG Strix x570 around for the next 10 years, hopefully it lasts as long as my Xeon system. AMD's CPU's are the real deal (literally) and they perform as well, if not better than, their Intel counterparts. 5-star product.

It's a beast from the central west to east?

  For most of you you will be using it for gaming.  I will tell you to pair it with Samsung B-Die for the most optimal performance with lower sub-timings.  Use Ryzen Calculator to configure your ram to get the most out of Ryzen.I have a 3700X, 2700X, 2400G, 1700.  All have been great with no problems whatsoever. The Ryzen 3700X isn't that much better than a 3600X for gaming in 2k or higher.  If you game at 2k or better go with a 3600X and save the extra 100$ and put it towards a better GPU.  I game with a Aorus 1080 Ti mostly with a 1080p, 2k 144hz, 4k monitor. ALL resolutions basically. (yeah I know).  I am using Teamgroup Night Hawk Legend CL 14 memory. I have found that this memory to be the best on the market in my benchmarks and timings.  CL 14-14-14-28 3600 overclocked from 3200mhz with 1.44 volts.  My main rig is using the Gigabyte X470 Gaming 7 1.1.  It's been pretty stable with the F42e and later bios updates.  Remember that Ryzen is completely as stable with all memory like Intel is.  In the future it should with continuous updates. (Ryzen is only a few years old while Intel's architecture is around 6 years old, same node smaller die).  If you do any workstation content I recommend the 8 core Ryzen 3000 parts.  And only the Ryzen 3000 cpus over Intels.  The problems have nearly all been ironed out with Ryzen 3000.  The single-core IPC is faster than Intel's current 9th and 10th gen parts by about  12% clock for clock and even higher in multi-threaded workloads due to the chiplet design.  The chiplet layout allows for the IHS to spread heat over it much easier than a monolithic cpu therefore lowering temperatures in return and using less power with a 7nm density chip.I highly recommend Ryzen 3000 to anyone look for among the best gaming PC among the 9900k.  Modern games now utilize all threads in some games and even Intel's 8 core 9700k will stutter in some titles.  I would not purchase the 9700k as it's too overpriced for what it offers.  Overclocking Intel's chips is the only way to beat Ryzen 3000 but then you have to deal with heat.  I personally wouldn't run a cpu at 80C or near that.  75C is my max personally for long periods of time.I would like to see how Ryzen 4000 stacks up against Ryzen 3000 as that is what it will be competing against mostly in the market with now.  Intel needs to quickly get off the 14nm node and switch to their 10nm before it's too late as it already is for Intel.  AMD just announced the 3300X for 120$ which is a phenomenal gaming cpu that is comparable to the 7700k that was priced 350$.  That's less than half the price and AMD is showing that they are now fooling around and is now competing in the mobile and high-end spectrums of the market.

Great upgrade over previous Ryzen CPUs
","

  I've had every generation of Ryzen, including the 1700 & 2700.  The 3700X is a huge upgrade over the previous generations.  It's a no compromise CPU, good for nearly every task from productivity to gaming.  I've seen a huge improvement in 1080p gaming, especially when gaming on Linux via Proton.  Well worth the upgrade for me.  Also, the included Wraith Prism cooler keeps the processor cool and looks great.Pros:Great gaming performanceStays cool and uses less electricity then the competitionComes with an awesome cooler in the boxEasy upgrade path if you have a compatible AM4 motherboardGood bang for your buckNo need to overclock, unlike the older Ryzen 1700, XFR works really well for my needs.Cons:Doesn't have integrated graphics (not really a con if you plan on purchasing a discrete GPU)Bottom line:If you're on the fence, buy this CPU.  You will not be disappointed.

  I bought this processor at Best Buy because they would price match amazon, and I don't know what else to say other than this thing has far exceeded my expectations. This thing has power, and it efficient in any task I put it up to. Both multi-core and multi-thread performance have been stellar, and gaming with it is night and day compared to my old 4770k. The stock cooler is great as well, though if you're looking to overclock I would recommend upgrading that. For me the stock cooler is great, and does a good job at keeping the CPU around 70 degrees. I would highly recommend this CPU to everyone. It's essentially an i9 for half price. Not to mention it comes unlocked out of the box. 10/10

  Bought on launch day, via Newegg.  A few teething issues for the first month or so with the AGESA and chipsets, but in hindsight nothing too major, for me.  Runs really well, limited OC, but guess this is the way it may be now.  Highly recommended, although a .3 more ghz would have made this an incredible chip.

  This CPU is an absolute beast for stunningly low costs. the fan looks great, but it's so cool (thermal wise) yet powerful it doesn't need the fan to run the desktop. it's easy and intuitive to use, and the only problems you can have is if you're an idiot like me and don't update your motherboard BIOS. the fan can be a little frustrating to mount, but for the cores and speed you get for the price, this CPU is the best choice for any mid range PC. and anything else is just the ryzen 5 or 9, which are in this product's same line.

Very happy with the performance and it is using an amazing 70 watts less power (at idle) than my previous desktop configuration.  I would have been happy with 6 cores, but I wanted to future-proof it some.  At idle, the cores sit at around 2.2Ghz and then they zoom to 4.4Ghz as need (which is rare).

  First things first...  The Ryzen 7 3700 CPU is fantastic.  I have no problems with this CPU at all.However, the Wraith LED CPU cooler has some issues.  The Instructions are a bit confusing because they aren't very clear on whether to plug in both the LED cable and the USB cable...or to choose either the LED or the USB and plug in one cable only. (btw...ONLY plug in ONE of the cables into the MB...not both...it's recommended that the USB cable be plugged in for best results).After fighting with the setup and not being able to get the LED colors on the device to work correctly with the Wraith Prism software, I finally found a youtube video that mentioned only plugging in one of the two cables (USB).  After doing this, I ended up with another issue, the Wraith Cooler device causes a USB port failure in Device manager and no matter how many attempts I've made to fix the issue...(removing software, removing the device, rebooting, reinstalling drivers, reinstalling software, changing USB ports on the MB, etc, etc, etc...)  I found that the Wraith LED CPU Cooler is fine without the LED lights, so I just shut them off and disabled the notifications that Windows Explorer keeps generating to let me know that a USB device isn't working.Hence the title.... CPU Awesome.  However, the wraith LED CPU Cooler...not so much.  I'd give it 5 stars if the CPU Wraith LED Cooler worked better with Windows 10.

I've been able to run games like Minecraft and Roblox, but the R7 360 just can't keep up and I get black screen if I go into fullscreen whenever I've tried. The processor itself has done really well on what I've used it for, but I will update this when I get the graphics card in tomorrow and can test it on Fortnite and other games aka Minecraft RTX on and I'll download a few more intensive ones for the sake of bench marking. If the processor works well with my GPU I will update to 5 stars. This is great for anything and it should be a massive improvement from an AMD FX 6300.

  I upgraded from an i7-6700k, going from intel to amd I was a bit worried but ive been running this on my system for about 3 days now and I am extremely satisfied. I didnt use the cooler that came with it but I will be using it in a different system im building

No Complaints Here...
","

  For what you pay, it's hard to touch. Having odd BIOS issues with MSI B450 Tomahawk (crashes when accessing @ bootup) but no issues once in Win 10. All cores turbo'd to 4.2, 24/7; no heat-related lockups on stock cooler. I would have stayed with Intel had MSI not had the BIOS Flashback ability as I've been with Intel since the post Thunderbird chip days and didn't have an AMD chip to flash the BIOS with.All things considered, I can't complain but I have a lot of experience building and someone less experienced might've become frustrated with some of the initial install issues I had. It's a no frills board but has everything I need for a gaming PC and nothing I don't, which is what I wanted as the motherboard market is a joke right now in terms of pricing, much like RAM.Good proc, though...just do your research in regards to possibly needing a BIOS update and RAM compatibility and you should be fine.

Impressed

  i used to use MAD all the time then they kinda faded away but came back with the Ryzen Family recently i switched over and started biulding the Ryzen systems i have to say im very impressed they are very stout CPU's and are priced at half the cost of the comparable Intel CPU. What i found to be the best feature was its low watt usage meaning you could use those extra watts for something else in the biuld

The perfect Work Beast
","

  Change to Ryzen 7 3700X was the best decision i have made since it improved mostly my workflow. My gaming performance changed as well but this is a secondary issue since my workflow improved drastically. Since 3800X or 3900X had closer performance so this is a good choice, only surpassed for 3950X.Working in 3d Renders here is an Overnight change. Video encoding and Graphics Editing has improved performance.

Needs more control over idle clock and power consumption
","

  Idle power consumption is 72 Watts on my MSI Gaming Edge X570 MoBo, double that of my old i7-4770K rig.  Part of the problem is that idle clock is still 1.78GHz, over double that of the Intel CPU (800MHz).  Hopefully, further BIOS updates will reduce idle power consumption of the CPU and X570 chipset.OTOH, it runs reasonably cool (32C idle, 74C stress test) with a Noctua NH-D14 cooler.

Fantastic performance.
","

  Single and multi-thread performance are exceptional. Comes with a nice cooler. Price is good if you avoid the wanker-resellers. This is easily the biggest leap hardware-performance wise that I've experienced since 2000, going from a heavily overclocked 8370 to this 3700. I couldn't be more pleased than with this CPU.

Great buy, hot chip, would recommend aftermarket cooling
","

  Runs very hot and occasionally spikes 5-8 degrees in temp. Mine idles at 40-45c maxes out at 82c under heavy load with a 360 nzxt kraken. PBO enabled at 1.29v, gaming gets me a solid 4.1/4.2 on average. I had to change the ramp up time of my fans to avoid random bursts of noise. Otherwise its a very powerful chip and a great value. Its on a x570 msi carbon, paired with a 2080, 32 gigs of 3000 ram.

  I haven't done a build in over 5 years so my mind was set with Intel from previous experiences. After some research, I did some rethinking and went with the 3700X. No regrets! Better specs and much better price than the Core i7. Great processor, very quick.

Worth it!

  Just fyi when I bought this it was on sale for around 299$ not 360$ so at the time it was a deal. This processor definitely has the power for gaming and multi-tasking or video editing! Great for streaming if your a streamer. Its super stable, but it does need faster ram like most of the Ryzen Cpu line. So make sure you use ram 3200mhz or higher cause if not when you go to over clock you will run into overloading bus problems.

  At first it wouldn't boot up, reinstalled old cpu, updated the bios for the motherboard, reinstalled this cpu, and it works great.  Make sure your bios is  up to date.  The computer runs smooth and fast.  I can't speak to over clocking, I never over clock.

  This is a great product and I averaged a 4.25Ghz overclock at 1.38v.  Though honestly I (at the time of writing this) would spend the extra 30.00 and get the 3800x and not overclock it.  I know it’s strange but I am pleased with my purchase and it works great.

  Hopefully this lasts as long as my previous 8350.  My last machine is still a strong computer.  So far very very happy with the 3700x.  My 8350 would heat up my whole office.  Sure big heatsink and fan cooled it but the heat went in the room.  With the 3700x that is a thing of the past.  Runs cool and I'm not heating a room with it.  Ran the ASUS optimizer and ti put on a 16% overclock.  Running cool.  Benchmarks run near the top of the charts which is amazing considering this is not a big dog cpu.  Excellent bang for the buck if you want a strong machine with some cushion for the future. My benchmarks improved when I docp'ed the ram... noticeable in the multi thread area so this baby likes lots of data in.  Bought elsewhere due to delivery issues but all else was amazon.

JUST WHAT I NEEDED!! Well made CPU with a beautiful stock cooler!
","

  I am EXTREMELY happy with this thing, and it is well worth the money. Runs great, VERY fast, and pretty easy to install (although you'll need to look up some videos to install the stock cooler, the one shown here doesn't explain how to install it), and the stock cooler is nice and beefy. The pre-applied thermal paste saved me a few bucks too!Not only that, but the AMD fan it comes with supports tons of RGB lighting functionality via your motherboard, and looks GORGEOUS. It also faces toward the side of the case, and while this may not be the greatest for air flow, it looks sick with a glass side panel. I was not expecting the stock cooler to look this nice, but it is easily the highlight of my build.Switched from Intel i7 to this AMD - and very happy with the decision! This is well worth the price and is probably the best you'll get in this price range. I'm amazed at how fast this thing is.IMPORTANT NOTE - If you're planning on overclocking, it's best to invest in a super-high-end cooler (maybe even water cooling!), I'm told the stock cooler IS NOT made to handle the heat that overclocking brings.
