It's a Beast
","

  Just got my 3600X today, and this thing is a beast. Putting it under a H115i  keeps it cool enough to hit 4.2Ghz at just 1.35v. I am coming from a 2600(non-X), and this is leaps and bounds ahead of the old processor. I would recommend that you stick with a X470 or B450 board unless you really need PCIe gen 4.0 or any of the other extras X570 offers. With the lower power draw than last generation, it should have no problem on most X470 and B450 boards. Most if not all need to have their BIOS flashed/updated to run Ryzen 3000, so make an informed decision on whether you need to borrow an older chip or find a board that can update without a CPU.I fully and 100% recommend this CPU and believe anyone will be happy with it in both gaming and workflows. As always, make an informed decision based off other users and reviews to make sure this is the best choice for you!

It isn't practical to match the 3600X with a 3600. Despite what people say, this is a good purchase.
","

  People will try to tell you ""don't buy the 3600X, just buy the 3600 and overclock it to 3600X levels and save money."" Sorry, Zen2 doesn't work that way.The 3600 and 3600X use the same voltage to reach their respective 4.2 and 4.4GHz boost clocks, which means the only way you're going to match the 3600X is to put it under water and run potentially unsafe voltages, at which point that extra $35-$50 starts looking a lot better than the $100+ to cool the 3600 well enough to keep up with the 3600X, and even then, the 3600 will NEVER match the single threaded performance of the 3600X.If you don't need an 8-core CPU, this is the CPU you want, skip the 3600 and go for this.

CPU is great, but older motherboards are dicey, and new ones aren't cheap
","

  I'm coming from an i7-4790K which I had set to a 4.6GHz all-core boost. This Ryzen chip gives me much smoother framerates in games, Windows boots faster, and the stock cooler is actually pretty solid. I have basically no complaints about the chip. If your primary use is games, then there's actually little reason to get the 8-core or 12-core versions. At $200 and $250, the 3600 and 3600X are fantastic values. You're getting really good performance at prices that Intel can't even get close to without losing its shirt.My problem is the older motherboards that are getting updated to recognize this new generation of AMD CPUs. In short, it's a crapshoot. If you're trying to save money by getting a B450 motherboard that can update, you may find it difficult for your PC to even boot. So if you do want one of these chips, I recommend going with an X570 board instead. Not only can they reliably boot, but you'll also be able to upgrade all the way to the 16-core chip without having to worry about your board overheating. Most of the older boards can't go that far.The thing is, the newer boards are not cheap. A solid choice like the ASUS X570-Plus or the Gigabyte Aorus Elite will cost you $200. A decent choice like the Gigabyte Gaming X or ASUS Prime X570-P will still cost you $170. That's quite a jump from the widely recommended MSI B450 Tomahawk that was recently going for about $100. That's the price difference between my 6-core 3600X CPU and the 8-core 3700X. You shouldn't have to sacrifice core count just to get a motherboard that works reliably.Alternatively, you can wait for MSI to release the ""Max"" versions of its older motherboards, which are claimed to be getting a few updates to their physical components to make them boot as reliably as the X570 boards. But there's no ETA on that, and no announced prices.So 5 stars for the CPUs, but 2 stars for how the motherboard makers have been handling them. AMD may also have waited a long time to send test chips to the makers, because they're notorious for leaking information to generate hype. Given how different these CPUs are from the previous gen, such a chain of events would explain the issues that we've been seeing.

No game & AMD's very cold behavior towards paying customers of 20yrs.
","

  EDIT 2/3/2020Returned the perfecly working processor on principle. There it no way I'm going to reward AMD/Amazon a cent for this little stunt, and I assure you all, it's illegal what they did. There is simply no way I'd a bought this CPU if it weren't for the expensive game that was supposed to come with it, but I suppose that was the whole idea...sell the CPU, then renege. I bought a much less expensive used one (my intentions before I saw the game came with it) . This one is well worth making public on youtube....what a hassle.The verification process for the game is horrendous, and I ended up with some Xbox pass (don't own XBox). I've used AMD CPU's/Graphics excursively for around 20yrs.So, no problem, just email AMD and they'll make it right...right?... wrong. In reply I received the old tactic, where AMD chose to pretend they misunderstood my email, hoping to frustrate me into giving up. After a few replies of same, I called them on it, and no reply.That was a cold, uncaring, ""You need us, we don't need you"" to big for it's britches AMD saying, ""We're and extra special exception, so big/valuable that we don't have to worry about treating the individual properly as others do...no game for you.And BTW, this was a very valuable part of the sale and the very reason some went with the Ryzen, and it ended as essentially, a bait and switch and for no good reason..Fortunately, an also big company still in touch with it's people, Amazon, does offer personal CS and I'm hoping when they screen this post, they will simply contact me by email with a Steam game code for The Outer world, the game I wanted but mistakenly didn't get, but only got a HUGE hassle from AMD.

Don't bother with the X - get the base 3600
","

  So, through promos and whatnot, I was able to get the 3600X at the same price as a regular 3600. Since in the Ryzen refresh gen the 2600X was a better buy than the 2600, I thought, why not? Well, to put it simply, don't pay extra for the X. Both chips, the base 3600 and the X version, pretty much top out at the boost speed of 4.4GHz. Now the X version may be a little better at maintaining that speed, in gaming and most benchmarks there is a minuscule difference between 4.4 and 4.2GHz. So what's the point of the X if it's not even better binned? Not much.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is due to this $50 price difference of getting bamboozled by a fancy X. Of course, I could have waited for reviews to see the difference,  blah blah blah, but I wanted to support AMD and get it on release date, so sue me. I won't be the first person to pay the difference and won't be the last either. Get the base 3600, it's amazing.

You're paying more for less. Get a 3600 and third party heatsink instead.

  The 3600X stock heatsink doesn't cut it. It eventually throttles to 95C and 3.9GHz.The 3600 with a third party cooler hits max 65C at 4.2GH and is $20 cheaper overall.You will be paying $50 for the ""X"" on this CPU. If you want better performance and are willing to pay extra, get the Ryzen 7 or 9. Ultimately I stuck with the 3600.

Holds 4.1GHz all-core with an AIO
","

  As of July 17th, 2019, my Ryzen 5 3600X automatically boosts to 4.4GHz with limited thread workloads, and boosts to 4.3GHz all-core for short bursts. Under sustained loads it holds 4.1GHz all-core while attached to my MSI B350M Gaming Pro motherboard with latest BIOS and chipset drivers, and cooled with a Corsair H55 AIO CPU cooler. Paired to CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 2400 RAM, my Passmark v9.0 CPU score is 20690 and my single threaded score is 2903.  All settings were set to auto on my motherboard. Max temps were 76C under sustained HandBrake (video transcoding) loads and 85C under Prime95 loads, in a Thermaltake Versa H13 with light/moderate air flow.Overall the CPU is phenomenal, and I purchased it over the Ryzen 5 3600 (non-X variant) because, although the reviews for the 3600 are as good as the 3600X, the silicon lottery tends not to favor me. So I paid the extra $50 to ensure better CPU binning and exceptional single threaded performance. With that being said, I would suggest for most users, the 3600 (non-X variant) will be the ideal price/performance balance.Be warned, voltages for Zen 2 processors are unusual, and the 3600X is no exception. As a consequence, idle power draw seems excessive, and will likely require BIOS, driver, and OS optimizations over the coming month/years to temper this early-adopter problem. Also, if you monitor voltage, it's best to do so with either CPU-Z or better, Ryzen Master software, as other resources are not yet tailored to accommodate accurate reads from Zen 2 chips.

so far no luck!!! stuck with bios refusing to upgrade using old ryzen 1600.
","

  so, i am struggling here and i am an IT pro. i had an asrock AB350 motheboard with ryzen 1600. in order to run this cpu it needed bios update. so, board REFUSED to update to any version higher than 3.20 and to run this cpu it needed last version 6.0 something. some boards suggested downgrading to version 3.0 then try to upgrade, or try running 3600x with downgraded bios. so, as it refused to post with new cpu i returned old cpu and tryed to flash old bios back to restore it to where it was and in the middle of flash board bricked. so, now i am ordering x470 board - cheapest i could find, but it seems that those also not going to run 3600x initially and will need a re-flash, so, will see what will tomorrow bring. i would get x570 but they were all out and what is available costs unreasonable. amd should have never created this mess - they had to find a way to make boards at least post and go into setting page for re-flashing with new cpu, the process now is ridiculous and there is 0 information of what to do. i still cannot find WHY asrock ab350 refused to show new bios files for upgrade - i downloaded then all from the same page and placed the on the same drive - but with the old CPU none of new bios was offered for the upload. i guess they thought that you need to identify new cpu in order to be able to flash new bios you need, and no one actually realized that the board itself will not boot with new cpu and old bios. ridiculous!!!PS. So, with all that said - adjusted to 4 stars. CPU is good. MSI x470 board agreed to get updated with 1600 ryzen in it, and allowed to install and run 3600x with no issues.  asrock ab350 goes into garbage - refused to recover even after sitting overnight with the cmos reset switch on. c'est la vie.

This is like a 2700X on steroids
","

  I 'upgraded' the box I had the 2700X to a 3600X.  No fears, the 2700X is still a good CPU, I just move it to another box.  But its amazing to me that AMD's second-lowest Zen 2 tier is actually performing better than my 2700X did.  This is an incredible CPU for $250.  I think people will be impressed by it.As in my 3900X review, one word of caution to anyone stuffing a Zen 2 processor into an older motherboard.  Remember to update the BIOS first, and also that some difficulty might be encountered with these early BIOSes, particularly on A320 or B350 motherboards.  Since most mini-itx motherboards are B350 I expect a lot of people are probably intending to stuff these CPUs into B350 mobos.  I would actually wait until you have a BIOS that uses AGESA 1.0.0.2 or higher before trying to do that.  BIOSes with AGESA 1.0.0.1 or lower will likely have trouble even POSTing with a Zen 2 CPU in the socket.Other than that, have at it!  The only real limitation with older motherboards is their socket power delivery capability, but honestly these new CPUs use so little power if you don't try to overclock them that it just isn't issue getting the advertised stock performance on any motherboard other than an A320 chipset.  The A320 mobos tend to have 100W socket limits which will somewhat crimp a Zen 2 CPU, though it will still work I would not recommend it.  I do totally recommend B350 and better mobos, at least once the BIOSes catch up.-Matt

Paying $50 for a letter

  Yes i am stealing the title from a Gamer Nexus review, but seriously you must watch the comparison between the 3600 and the 3600x. I am slightly regretting buying the 3600x as it performs IDENTICAL to the 3600 when OC'd to the same frequency.However... Out of the box performance is better, although very marginally, so for those that aren't into overclocking, this CPU is for you. Oh and you do get the better Wraith cooler with the "" X "" version. But that doesn't justify the extra $50.I upgraded from a 2600 and instantly started bench marking to compare with my old tests. Stock-for-stock the 3600x is night and day faster than the 2600 and I am seeing 15-20% FPS gains using a GTX 1080 hybrid at 1440p. Games that are not GPU intensive I am seeing closer to 30% FPS gains (LoL, Dota, CSGO, Fortnite, Overwatch etc.)

Until the 1600AF drops back to $85, this is the new budget king.
","

  I upgraded from a 1600AF. It definitely was NOT worth the money to upgrade, even accounting for the money I can sell the 1600AF for. I did this upgrade purely because I wanted the most up-to-date CPU I could get in my price range, because for Ryzen 5xxx I'm going to have to upgrade motherboards.As you all know, this CPU is a total banger for a budget-based system. I did not experience any of the high voltage or crazy temps at idle that others report, though my BIOS has been fully updated for awhile now, so maybe that helps. I also am running AMD chipsets and Ryzen Balanced Power Plan (though some testing between the two Ryzen plans shows little to no variance).I had also read, as I'm sure a lot of you have, that overclocking a 3600 is pointless because boost clocks will generally hit the same speed for the amount of time you'd need them to. Just for fun, I overclocked my 3600x. It is now running stable at 4.4GHz all-core. While I don't recommend just blinding inputting BIOS settings since every motherboard/CPU/set up is different, this happened with a +.204 vcore, which is still relatively low when it's not doing the thinking itself (Vcore is at 1.260-1.283). I also want to mention that temps at idle and during stress testing are now 3-4c lower than with the CPU left alone and PBO turned on. Note that the only reason I wanted to mess with a manual 4.4GHz overclock is because while my 3600X DID hit 4.4GHz on standard settings, as soon as the CPU hit 62c it would downclock to 4.2GHz anyway.So now onto some Cinebench R20 results (after roughly 15 passes):3600x Manual O/C 4.4GHz: Temps maxed at 68c, score: 3912.3600x PBO On, Average 4.2GHz: Temps maxed 70c, score 3719.1600AF Manual O/C 4.0GHz: Temps maxed 71c, score 2985.1600AF Stock Clock of 3.2GHz: Temps were low, but I don't recall exactly, score 2693.2200G Manual O/C 4.0GHz: Don't recall temps, score 1439 (xD).So the 3600X is faster at standard settings (and certainly overclocked) than a 1600AF, which is essentially just a 2600 in disguise. Who would have thought. :)All tests (except on the 2200G) were done with an Enermax 240mm AIO, and all tests were done with 16GB of Corsair 16CL 3000MHz RAM. Case is a Phentaks P300, though I did mod the front panel for better airflow. Ambient temps for all tests were in the 70-74c range.

CPU itself is great but the stock Wraith Spire cooler is a HUGE let down
","

  Brought the Ryzen 3600x when it's under discount to replace my old 1600. The CPU is excellent and the temp never exceeded 50 when under load (gaming like new COD MW). It immediately boosts my fps by 15%. However, the stock cooler is very disappointing. I am not very sensitive to the buzzing noise from cooling fans -- but this one's different. Even after I manually optimized the fan curve, it still ran around 1700 rpm without load and can easily go beyond 2500 shortly under load. It literally sounds like a jet engine sitting right next to me. The noise is not extremely loud but the frequency sits right in my uncomfortable zone and can easily penetrate my SONY noise cancelling headphone.  I knew 3600x is not better than 3600 and all the extra bucks were for the ""better"" stock cooler and I was hoping that I can save money by using that cooler instead of buying a third party one to replace the stock wraith silent bundled with 3600 -- I was wrong. I actually think the wraith silent on my old 1600 is a better choice since it's at least very quiet. In the end I brought a cooler master RGB to replace the wraith spire and finally got rid of the noise. The cooler now runs at 900/1400 without/with load and is barely audible. I still would recommend to by 3600x at the price I paid (200) but anything more than that would be wasteful -- you can just spend the extra money to buy a better cooler for 3600 and get indistinguishable performance.

To a point where Amazon just stopped responding but did not send put further codes. Shady business all around but I've learned my lesson that Amazon will not honor their promos 100%.Now onto this processor: We switched our setups from Intel to AMD because they seem like the better value in general. We could upgrade a few more parts for the same price as only buying the Intel chip we had in mind.

  I wanted to buy a cheap, mid-range CPU I would eventually replace (in about 1-2 years for the Ryzen 7, 4000 series as my more permanent CPU) but regardless, I'm impressed. The infinity fabric is a technological wonder. The advertised stock clock on this is 3.8 GHz but, with Trident Z Neo RAM pre-optimized for Ryzen series (so I didn't even have to do anything other than turn on D.O.C.P in the BIOS), I was at a stable 4.0 GHz at STOCK CLOCK, IDLE, OUT OF THE BOX. I inched my way up to an overclocked 4.3 GHz, with no issues, at 1.3 V. Can I go up to 4.5 GHz or 4.6 GHz? Sure, if I want to keep pushing my luck. This already feels like overkill for gaming and this is $200?!?!? My last CPU was an Intel at 3.6 GHz locked - as in I was incapable of overclocking (it was in a pre-built).Intel, take notes because I know you already are. Apparently AMD is just going to keep pushing the envelope for dollar-per-performance so we can all have high-end gaming CPUs for a couple of hundred, if not below $100 when on sale. I know next-gen everything is coming out for games in late 2020 or early 2021 but I feel like AMD is going to close that performance gap, at this pace, anyways.Can it get better? Sure, keep buying AMD CPUs.

  Recently made a somewhat lateral move from a 9600k to the 3600x. Mainly wanted to gain SMT (hyper threading) to take advantage of a few games utilizing more then 8 threads to deal with some micro stutter i was having. The 9600k on a Asus strix z390 was clocked at 4.8ghz all core turbo with idle speeds in the mid 20s with max load temps during r15 at 84c at 1.3vThe 3600x with PBO enabled and XMP  will NOT hit the 4.4 max  boost in an all core load in cinebench r15  Not even a single core. All 6 cores max at 3.9ghz. Only random burst up to 4.366ghz during random desktop task is all i have experience even with a Corsair h115i 280mm AIO. Same AIO was  used on the 9600k.With my fan curve set the same on both systems and the AIO pump speed at 2000 rpm. The 3600x was hitting high 90s during cinebench r15.  mx4 thermal paste was used on both cpus. I repasted the 3600x 3 times and even tried 2 other brands of thermal paste. no difference. I  had to ramp the pump speed up to 3000 rpms and set the fan curve much more aggressive to keep thermals the same as the 9600k. Keep in mind the ryzen was basically stock. never once reach max boost speed only xmp enabled for the ram meanwhile the intel was overclocked 200 mhz on all core. So during the cinebench runs the 3600x was running at 3.9ghz vs 9600k at 4.8ghz on all 6 cores and the intel ran over 10c cooler with same fan curves.Running Unigine Heaven gpu benchmark the numbers were with a 2080ti Hybrid, 16gb 3200mhz RAM1080p ultra settings, Tessellation extreme3600xAvg fps 182.2Score 4590Min fps 9.5Max fps 366.99600kAvg fps 182.5Score 4597Min fps 40.9Max fps 376.9In conclusion neither cpu seemed to bottleneck my 2080ti. Also my games are typically played in 1440p so the difference is minimal. The cinebench scores were about 400 points higher with the 3600x. roughly 30% higher then the intel. 1200 vs 1600 give or take depending on the run.  However even with a lower TDP the 3600x still seemed to run higher temps then the over clocked 9600k so make sure you have proper cooling to get the performance out of the 3600x because the stock fan will run about 3000 RPM and sound like a jet taking off.

  This CPU is amazing. It is great at everything. It can game, multitask, stream, productivity, and more. It’s priced good enough that even if you just want it for general computing it’s still great. This thing comes pushed to the limit straight out of the box pretty much. Traditionally I overclock every CPU I buy but with this one AMD have pretty much pushed them to the max for us. Which is great because it’s plug n play! Mine with PBO and Thermal Limits set to max stays around 4.250ghz on all cores gaming under full load with 1 of the 6 cores boosting to 4.35-4.15ghz. So in a game 5 cores will be at 4.250 ghz and one core will always be around 4.35-4.15ghz with that 1 core alternating so they take turns. This gives great ipc and single threaded performance as well as multithreaded. This gives high FPS in games due to the strong single core performance than a 4.3ghz all core overclock gets. You can basically set PBO to max and TBU to max and your motherboard and system will boost it as high as it can. It’s amazing it’s literally drop it in and your good to go this time around. No overclocking needed. I have this CPU in the Asus Prime X570-Pro motherboard if anyone was curious. It was 260 dollar board so it’s pretty nice imo. So your numbers may be different than mine. For cooling I’m using a simple Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo in Push/Pull with twin fans. Keeps my CPU in the mid 30sC idle, in the 50sC in gaming rather it’s an hour or all day long. Under Prime 95 stress test it topped out at 76C then dropped back to 74C and stayed there. For a 35 dollar cooler pretty insane. I have great case air flow so if you do not do not expect these results. The best way to get more performance from your Ryzen CPU since it’s basically pushed to the max out of the box is via memory. You can look it up if you wish. Memory speed significantly effects your cpus performance at least in gaming. It was shown going from 2666mhz to 3600mhz memory speed in games was giving huge FPS increases. In almost all games 10-20 FPS increase with some games increasing as much as 30-40fps. So if you buy a Ryzen CPU for the love of god buy 3600mhz memory with it. I have 32GB of G.Skill Ripjaws in mine all running at 3600mhz and that’s using all 4 dimm slots 4x8GB sticks in duel channel mode. Fast memory paired with this CPU in a good motherboard means you don’t have to overclock or touch anything this time around and you get amazing performance in all regards. I have my 3600x and 3600mhz memory paired with a RTX 2070 Super that is overclocked really well and I am playing any games I want at 1440P maxed out getting 100+ FPS in pretty much everything. If you want a nice CPU for gaming, streaming, content creation, or anything else well you’re looking at one. At this point in time the Ryzen 3600XT is out now which is basically this exact CPU except it runs around 4.6ghz in the boosting alternative core and probably around 4.4 on the other 5 core. So you gain roughly about 200mhz over this 3600x by going with the XT. Rather that’s worth it well that’s up to you. At most the difference in FPS between the two might be 5 FPS at max. So just get whichever is the best deal. Even the Ryzen 3600 non X or non XT does very very similar in performance to the X and XT and is 150 dollars right now. Everything I said pretty much applies to all 3 CPUs they are just an amazing gaming chip.

Great Value (but buy on sale for $200)
","

  You get such an amazing processor for $200 when on sale. Comes with a nice cooler too. I bought a cooler Master too but found the stock cooler with my 3600x to be perfect since I don’t overclock. I recommend switching the thermal compound on it out with something of higher quality. As far as the processor goes make sure in the power setting to set your mininum processor state to 20 and maximum to 99. Doing this helps prevent any weird noises you might encounter. For gaming this processor is great. Barely hit 70 in most games and usually sits around 60-65 in processor heavy games. Now I like the stock cooler personally but I also want to warn people if you plan to overclock a cooler master isn’t a bad idea. Have a gigabyte aourus b450 board and the processor worked great after a simple bios update. I would definitely buy this again.

How ""upgrades"" should be.

  Great buy, it is a fantastic upgrade and stays cool and quiet with included cooler.Coming from a Ryzen 1600/b350M machine - so even the cooler is an upgrade for me (comes with paste, but replaced it with MX-4). My old MSI B350M has been rock solid and was glad it got the 3000 bios update - it never could OC my 1600 to ""X"" speeds, so no reason to try on a 3600. Decided to just go with the ""X"" version this time.It runs fantastic on my old B350M. Both ""Precision Boost"" and ""Overdrive"" show up on Bios after update. With everything on, I never see it dip under 4.2 GHZ and goes up from there.I left INTEL with my 1600, and I see no scenario where I would go back. AMD/MSi have earned a long term customer.

  This cpu is definitely a beast however had the 3600 been in stock when i ordered i would have just gotten that one.absolutely no issues so far did all the necessary bios updates and installed and did some overclocking. I am running it on the X470 Taichi board and was able to get a stable overclock at 4.3 ghz and as seen a bove got a very good score in cinebench r15. I got around 3857 i believe in r20. i play mainly apex legends and ESO. this is coupled with an overclocked RTX 2080 and has no problems keep it at 144hz until the usual frame drops that occur in game. I did need to push a little more voltage than i wanted to achieve a completely stable overclock(1.475 volts vcore) however when PBO was enabled i watched the vcore in HW monitor and was seeing it go as high as 1.5 so yeah.  Maybe a bios update coming for more power delivery optimization for my board.

Still Behind Intel for Gaming
","

  This is AMDs version of going from an IPhone 8 to an iPhone 9. They want you to pay up again a year later for a marginal performance increase over last years product. A 10-15% performance increase cannot justify the upgrade unless you just love to spend money.You would not even notice the gains in FPS. Going from 110 FPS to 125 FPS wouldn’t be noticeable for the majority of gamers. AMD still is behind Intel in clock speed and this cpu has virtually no overclock headroom so it cannot compete with the Now equally priced core i5-9600k in gaming. Just as the Ryzen 7 3700 cannot compete with the core i7-9700k. Sorry, but don’t believe the hype train. Facts are facts. I returned this and got an Intel because I don’t care about what’s popular I just want the best I can afford. Brand loyalty is for suckers.

Upgrade experience and performance tweaks
","

  ~4 stars, since its performance is so close to the 3600. Would be 5 stars if the difference with 3600 was under $20 or if it came bundled with a Wraith Prism cooler. Still waiting for my Xbox Pass after 2 weeks and several phone calls. May be a problem due to international shipping.Here's my experience with upgrading from a Ryzen 2600 with an Asus Strix B450.Quick take: Be ready to reset your CMOS on last-gen motherboards since any problem with memory, cpu fans, etc can result in total refusal to POST. Check your fabric speed to make sure it is matched 1:1 with your ram (fclk in BIOS).  Overall, has taken a little more monkeying around than I expected, but still an exciting upgrade to my 2600.BIOSThe BIOS on my Asus motherboard is pretty touchy about POSTing with the 3600x.  It will often power on the components but stay stuck with the red standby light. This happens when I try to set the XMP profile for my RAM, overclock the RAM too aggressively, or have any problem with the CPU fans.  If you run into this problem just reset the CMOS and try again. I was able to avoid the problem with XMP settings by just manually entering the RAM speed and timings, which work fine at XMP settings and even a little faster.  I would start with the low auto memory settings for the first boot and then reset and readjust manually after it is booting smoothly.Make sure you double-check for newer BIOS, chipset drivers and windows updates before upgrading. I forgot to do this and had some instability while updating this stuff through Asus Grid.Infinity Fabric clock and RAMAMD recommends Ram at 3600 mhz because it will run 1:1 with the infinity fabric. In Ryzen Master this is called ""coupled mode"" under the memory settings. After I set my RAM to 3600mhz I the fabric clock did not couple automatically and was still running at 1600 . There is an option to couple in Ryzen Master, but it crashed. The solution is to manually set the fabric clock with the fClk setting in BIOS. The infinity fabric should be set at 1/2 the frequency of your ram (3600 RAM =1800 IF). This dropped memory latency in AIDA from 82 to about 72. I was able to further raise the fabric to 1833 coupled with the Ram at 3066, which may be the limit for my chip's fabric. With tightened timings my latency is about 69.Temperature, voltage, precision boostThe idle voltage  is quite high, bouncing around 4.2 to 4.5 and the idle temperatures are around 50-55. The cpu regularly hits 4400 mhz or just under on a single core at a time. Nzxt's CAM software isn't able to read the temperature so I set the pump and fan speeds to a fixed 100% for now. I may use the mbo AIO header to bypass CAM completely if there isn't a fix soon.I tried the ""Gaming"" preset in Ryzen Master and got a couple more points in the single thread score in Userbench. Precision Boost Overdrive and +200 mhz Auto Overclocking do not work through Ryzen Master but are possible to enable in the BIOS advanced settings. After quickly running a few benchmarks and games I haven't noticed any boost in performance or observed the processor ever surpassing 4400mhz. I'm not sure if this is a compatibility issue with the b450 mbo or just the limited overclocking ability of Ryzen 3000.Sytem:Ryzen 3600X (Upgraded from 2600)Asus B450-I Strix GamingViper RGB 3600 CL16 (2 x 8gb) 16-17-17-34 1.35vZotac Amp RTX 2080Kraken X42 (push-pull)Adata SX8200 Pro 1tbDefine Nano S case(tested in a warm climate)

  Used to own an AMD Athlon a long time ago and upgraded to an i5 2500k so I could do some gaming, after a while AMD came out with the Ryzen lineup and it looked awesome and I wanted to get one so bad, I then saved my money for a better GPU (Went form a GT 1030 to a GTX 1070 OC) at around the same time AMD came out with the Ryzen 2000 series and I wanted one more than ever, after some time I got just enough money for the AMD Ryzen 2600 and an X470 motherboard, I decided to keep saving my money because ZEN 2 (Ryzen 3000) was coming soon, not long after I bought a Ryzen 5 3600x and an ASUS X570 motherboard, performance is awesome and really smooth, never had any problems with it (Yet) would defiantly recommend!

Incredible for the price, watch the thermals
","

  I will admit, I was hesitant to buy an AMD CPU. The benchmarks put it competing with Intel CPUs that cost nearly twice as much, so even though I've used Intel since my very first build I decided to try it out. And this CPU cannot be beat for the price. If you are planning on buying a CPU for a gaming rig, BUY THIS CPU. It blows the tits clean off any other Intel core at this price point, and every game I have thrown at it hits the 144 FPS mark. Before I upgraded (admittedly I was due for an upgrade, I'd been abusing the crap out of my i5 4690k with ridiculous overclocks) I had trouble reaching that 144fps on a couple games, namely warframe, GTA5, and Monster Hunter World. After this CPU, they all hit that cap across the board.Power consumption is relatively low for how much work it does, and the boost clock has run for about 2 weeks now without any instability or crashing.The only thing you should look at is buying a better heat sink. While the one they include is certainly better than any stock heat sink I've ever used, testing Monster Hunter World for an hour got the temps up to 78° at max with it installed, usually hovering around the high 60s. While that's still technically a safe temperature... it's still a bit high for my tastes, especially since I'm tired of constantly keeping an eye on coretemp. Plus, the fan isn't the quietest thing in the world, and the settings I used had the fan hit full power at 67° which meant it was almost always running at full whack. So I threw an old coolermaster on and the same tests maxed out at 69° averaging about 60°, which is much better.My mantra used to be Intel for CPUs and AMD for GPUs, but I'm an AMD man across the board now. I planned on buying the i9 9900k, but a friend told me to look into this CPU instead. I think I owe my friend a drink or two now since he saved me $200+!Bear in mind, the computer I use this on is used almost exclusively for gaming. The fact that this CPU is only 6 cores for a newer model makes me think it was specifically designed with gaming in mind. I cannot speak for other applications that are CPU intensive, especially those that benefit greatly from multiple cores. But for every current gen game, even crappy ports like Monster Hunter, this CPU is top-notch quality for a mainstream price.

I'm not a fan of the way they designed the pins and the heatsink definitely wasn't the best either.
","

  On the bottom of this CPU it has a boat load of tiny pins. Then I got the unit I saw that the pin was bent and to make a long story short it's basically broke two-three other pins and messed up the mother board. The heat sink is what bent the other pins when I straighten them back out they broke off. The pins are very fragile, I personally won't bother with another ryzen ever again. I bet that if it was properly installed it would be an excellent processer. I personally am going to buy a an alternative heatsink from now on when I purchase a processor.

Upgraded from Ryzen 7 1700X:
","

  Installed on an Asus B350F Strix. Can confirm with bios update works great. Compared to the older Ryzen CPUs, this one does run slightly hotter, but that is completely normal due to the new precision boost that the 3rd gen CPU family uses. With a D12s Noctua aftermarket air cooler, under sustained gaming load, it usually runs around 50-55c.Overall, for the cost versus what it does, this thing is a home run. I went from a Ryzen 7 1700x to this Ryzen 5 3600x, so I lost 2 cores but gained speed, and in my experience it runs everything MUCH faster. Would recommend!

  Firstly, buy the 3600 non-X. It's almost the same and cheaper.My computer runs at about 12-25% CPU load thanks to all the cores. I can have multiple games open and still have snappy responses from my OS and Chrome. Each core itself is fast and capable of over 100-150 fps on max settings or maybe even more (my GPU isn't super good).The cooling is even better than the performance. I used the stock cooler and I only have one wimpy case fan and it stays cool. It never goes above about 75 C (I have it at 4 Ghz). It idles at 50 C. Don't waster your money on a cooler unless you plan to do rendering or something that would take all cores. It can game with stock.

Awesome CPU, terrible fan (ish)
","

  This CPU comes unlocked by the manufacturer meaning that it is 100% overclocked capable. If you are like me then you like to set all of your settings on the BIOS to automatic meaning you want your devices to automatically monitor and adjust clock speeds depending your cooling, temperature and other aspects. I haven't manually OC it but the system seems to be running at 4.4 GHz almost all the time. Many people have told me just to reduce the clock speeds but I'm not to familiar with this and rather leave it on auto. I have case fans and everything.The only issue that I have with this is that the stock fan it comes with is not very good. My machine is always running on 1800 RPM's or even higher and this fan is extremely noisy. If I open Google Chrome you can hear the fan just jumping up and down between RPM's and this is very annoying and loud. If you plan on having this CPU over clocked then i would strongly recommend you getting a different CPU cooler because this one is very loud and will run a excessive high RPM's too keep the CPU cool.

Be careful
","

  This is a highly sensitive component in your PC and installing it incorrectly can cause damage. Now with that being said, after watching a quick YouTube video to figure out which direction the CPU chip goes in I was easily able to install it. The brackets for the CPU fan that came pre-installed on the motherboard needed to come off before I could screw in the fan to the back plate. The backplate is A Separate Peace and needs to be held on the back while screwing on the CPU fan. It only comes with one thermal paste compound so you only have one shot at installing this and if you mess up you're going to have to put your project on hold and buy more thermal paste. If you can't figure it out or you don't know what you're doing I recommend that you do not try to install this yourself and try to get help from somebody that knows what they're doing.

Great CPU with great value

  I just upgraded from an 8150FX black edition octo-core, from 2011... Huge (YUGE) improvement. Went with the 3600x over the 3600, as it was not much more expensive (on sale at $199). Went with an x570 motherboard, 16 GB (3600MHz) RAM. I already had a GeForce 1070Ti. Huge improvement in gaming. Highly recommend. I didn't go with the 3900x or 3950x (even though my MoBo has a VRM capable enough to handle it) as I didn't see the cost being worth the money ($199 vs $430-$730+). I do recommend pairing this with an x570 MoBo if you plan on upgrading (over a B450 for example) your processor in the future (to Ryzen 4th gen). The B450 motherboards CAN be compatible, but a lot of them require a BIOS flash. If you go with a B450, get a motherboard with a built in BIOS flash button/capable. Since B450's were made for 1st and 2nd gen Ryzen, they likely won't be compatible with Ryzen 4th gen (coming out late 2020 or early 2021).

  AMD has been making solid processors for a while now. I don’t need to tell you that. Prices are fluctuating constantly at this time (5/2020) but I was happy with the price I paid, and happy with the CPU. Easy to install, thermal paste already applied if you use the included wraith cooler. The PC I installed this into is used for video/photo/audio editing as well as gaming so I push it pretty hard without any issues at all. I won’t buy this one again because (hopefully) by the time I need a new CPU, AMD will no longer be using AM4. But if my house burned down tomorrow and insurance covered everything except the processor, I’d buy this one again in a heartbeat. Wouldn’t recommend it for mining crypto if you’re still into that, not without first getting a heftier cooler.

  Well, the CPU is awesome. We play any games with no issues. The computer is super fast and very powerful. It handles everything. I have built an Intel i5 9600k based machine virtually for the same amount of money and both computers are awesome. However, the Ryzen 5 3600x machine is more capable on multi-tread workload, about 35% and slightly slower on a single-tread workload, about 4/5%. It also seems that the graphics card on the AMD based computer, which is the same, runs about 10 frames faster. One thing I like on the Intel based computer is that the secondary hard drive is accelerated  with an Optane Memory, which is not yet available on AMD systems. All in all, I would definitely recommend this product or Ryzen 7 2700X, which is cheaper and has two more cores and four more threads, and costs a bit less. However, the 2700X single-tread performance is not as good as the 3600X performance, thus games will still run better on the Ryzen 5 3600X.

The price to performance for this CPU is hard to beat, especially when it is on sell for $200.The reason I don't give it five stars is more to do with Amazon and zero to do with AMD. On the product page, you will see references to AMD's game bundle with Game Pass when you purchase Ryzen products. This is normally the case with other retailers but Amazon does not seem at all familiar with or able to provide a code for this which is unfortunate. So if you are expecting the Game Pass or other game promo because of what the product description or ad shows on this page, I am sad to inform that they will not be sending you anything. I should have been a bit more thorough in my research because I would have seen that other people have posted in the FAQs about similar issues and getting mixed messages from Amazon about this.

  Using this CPU for moderate gaming, it performs great with no major issues. However, Amazon has simply refused to deliver on the free digital goods that come with purchasing this CPU (the ""Equipped to Win"" package, detailed on this product's page), so DON'T buy from Amazon, unless you're okay with skipping about a hundred dollar's worth of gaming material. Looking at other reviews, it seems that I'm not the only one with this problem; meanwhile, I don't see any of these issues reported on the Newegg website, I would recommend buying from there instead.CPU Performance:+ Solid, no problems two months in.+ With moderate gaming and without overclocking, CPU stays below 70C with the stock cooler.+ Without overclocking, CPU clock reported at around 4.05 GHz on average when under moderate load, which is near the high end (as expected for the X version of this Ryzen 5 3600).+ Some accompanying parts in my build: Asus Prime X470, Zotac 1050 Ti, GSkill 3200 32GB+ My rating would be 4/5 if not for issues with Amazon customer service (see below).Troubles with Amazon:- TL;DR: After contacting Amazon customer service 5+ times, and waiting for 2 months, I still haven't gotten what was promised as part of the ""Equipped to Win"" deal. Such an awful experience; I can't believe that it's this difficult to get what I purchased...- Deal states that promo code would be emailed to you within two business days of purchase. The deal is outlined and advertised on this page (see ""Special offers and product promotions"" section). You can also verify this deal on the AMD site for the ""Equipped to Win"" package, which lists Amazon USA as a participating vendor.- After two weeks, I contacted customer service about this via chat. They tried explaining it away or flat-out misunderstood me and abruptly ended chat before I could explain.- I then tried calling customer support multiple times, who just forwarded the case to the Marketing & Sales team. I only got a response after the third time, in which they told me to contact AMD. So I did, but AMD explained that it was the vendor's responsibility to distribute promo codes.- I called Amazon support AGAIN. This time, I got a response email asking for the error message that I got when applying my promo code (??). Clearly, they still had no clue what was going on, since I never got anything resembling a promo code.- I called Amazon support AGAIN, and they offered a $100 promotional credit. I said fine, since $100 is enough to cover the missing game + game pass. However, unbeknownst to me, this credit is only for products SOLD by Amazon, and doesn't apply to downloadable goods (wtf?), so I couldn't even purchase the missing goods, not to mention, anything else that I wanted to buy from Amazon's website.- I would be willing to change the rating if I finally get the promo codes or an appropriate reimbursement, but I've pretty much given up at this point. I've wasted ~3 hrs talking to customer service about the same thing and have essentially waited two months for a solution...

  *** FIRST BUILD, COMPLETE SUCCESS, w/ ASUS PRIME x470 PRO MOBO***ABSTRACT: Its alive!  First hand qualified source CONFIRMING this AMD Ryzen 5 3600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked processor IS OUT OF THE BOX FULLY COMPATIBLE with the ASUS Prime x470 Pro motherboards having a bios number of 5204.  NO OLDER PROCESSOR OR MOBO BIOS UPDATE REQUIRED.Details:So for my first ever attempt at a custom build, I decided to create a gaming computer for my nearly 11 year old son.  Yes a gaming pc for a 5th grader, lol!  So of cource clock speed and graphics capability were the most relevant aspects for prospective hardware.  The sum total of which had to meet the requirements I imposed due to my sons age:  Cost containmemt and long term viability.The respective parameters for which were ~$1000 budget (tower components only) and 5-6 year prospective upgradability and relative viability lifespan.Oh and the pesky little detail being that when the power switch is on pressing the power button actually makes the computer begin the boot process.However, COMPATIBILITY was the inherent OVERRIDING REQUIREMENT that concerned me the most. I quickly discovered the significant challenge posed to me, by using the most contemporary Hardware and desiring absolute confidence regarding integration and compatibility between all system components. I suspect this concern is not something unique to me or first time builders.  Though its degree is likely relative to one's experience.  None the less, there is a constant rule regardless of experience:the the amount of existing information about component integration is inversely proportional how recently it was released.  More recent, less info.  Less recent, more info.  Something that a fairly intelligent mammal shoukd intuitively realize.  Yet escaps me until this endeavor. Duh.But with the resesrch and 24 hours strait spent on assembling the parts, I achieved what I sought, (save the two hours of panick that occured subsequent the first time I pressed THE POWER BUTTON!!!)  Just a loose connection.  A good thing.

Awesome Chip! Glad I got it!

  I have had absolutely no issues with this 3600x. Not one bit of microstuttering. I had an Intel 7700k that would do that, really frustrating at times. So I went with the 2600x and kept it for a bit. Than I upgraded to the 3600x, when it became available. AMD has me sold now. I have not used AMD since FX. When I got a taste of what Intel was all about. I thought I would never go back to AMD. AMD is now light years ahead of where they once were. I'm glad I made the switch. Only think is I wish they would clock a little better, not that bad, but not able to gain the speeds Intel does. For 7nm and more cores and threads than Intel and not any of the security issues Intel has.

Great CPU for the money.

  I was debating between this and its big brother the 3900x. I decided on this because of the gaming reviews on the various benchmark websites. It is a bit slower than the 3700x - 3900x but at half the price of the 3900x I just could not justify spending double for only a few percentage increase. Even though this is a 95w rated CPU it runs hotter than my 105w rated 2700x. I have a CM EVO 212 BE and it idles between high 30 and low 40 and under load stays under 75. I mainly game and this CPU is a noticeable upgrade over my 4790k and 1600x computers I just sold.

Constant BSOD and Browser Tab Crash

  Constant BSOD and Browser Tab Crash. It benchmarks great on the review websites but there are thousands of reviews online from people experiencing similar BSOD problems. Switching memory does not help, updating the BIOS does not help. I exhaustively tried changing many different settings in the BIOS but none of it fixed the problem. Reading through the many online reviews on reddit with similar issues, the only thing left to conclude is that the processor is defective. Now I have to beg AMD for a warranty replacement and hope that it works. What an epyc waste of time.

Great performance and value...

  These processors are great. I've had Ryzen since day one and have had a couple of processors from each generation. My main box has a 3700x. This CPU feels every bit as good as my 3700x for gaming and everyday use. I definitely noticed the performance uplift over the previous generation in games. I'd say if you want to tweak and tune get a 3600 and go for it. If you want to just throw a CPU in a box and turn on the automatic settings and be done with it, pay the extra and get this. I don't think you can go wrong either way. Just make sure you pair it with a nice motherboard and some good memory (3200 Minimum) and I think You'll be very happy.

Amazing CPU, Benchmarks Speak for Themselves!
","

  I recently upgraded my desktop from the AMD Ryzen 5 1600x (an already quite powerful processor for the price) to the Ryzen 5 3600x and have been amazed at what this processor can do. Its easily twice as fast or more than my workstation in my office which is only a year old and easily cost more than twice as much as my PC that I built myself. I do a lot of photo and video editing in addition to using Microsoft's ICE (Image Composite Editor) to stitch panoramas, and this processor handles anything I can throw at it without breaking a sweat. I originally went with AMD when I first built my PC because the 1st generation Ryzen CPU's were simply cheaper than Intel's I-5 chips, but now with the 3rd generation they're both cheaper AND better. Buy this and I guarantee you wont be disappointed! Take a look at the benchmarks using the UserBenchMark software, the results speak for themselves.

Paired with a RX 5700 XT
","

  I love this processor. I need to get more juice to it and my GPU, RX 5700 XT (new psu on the way). It is an awesome product. I never come close to thermal throttling currently holding boost speeds around 4.2ghz and temps at 65C under load. I can easily tab out of a game to anything and it is till snappy. Again I am only giving it about 25% of max power so I have some opportunities for growth and will update.Also can say the 5700 XT is my current bottleneck. I keep wanting 8 cores but there is literally no reason for it other than being able to tout a larger Cinebench score. Currently run 95 fps on cod on high/highest settings.For $25 difference at the time 5% more was worth it if it prevents me from overclocking the regular Ryzen 5 3600. It also comes with the better/larger stock cooler between the two.

Very good performance
","

  This cpu destroys everything I put in it, I would recommend getting the 3600 for it being cheaper but if overclocked it will have the same performance, only got this due to the 3600 being sold out and out of stock at the time. This cpu does run hot though, around 48-53C on idle and 77-81C on load, I recommend undervolting it to 1.325V at 4.2GHZ, I manage to keep it about 69-71C under load with the undervolting, idle stayed the same though. This is with the Noctua NH-U12S cooler.

Quick for Data Analysis.

  I decided to build a PC for data analysis (I use R, Orange, Python, etc...) so I wanted more than four cores, but was still on a budget. This is a great CPU. I can't speak to any benchmarks, and I don't really think I need to. You can run over to userbenchmark.com if you are wanting to see how this CPU compares to other CPUs. I considered purchasing the Ryzen 7 2700x, but this newer Ryzen 5 3600x has higher individual core speeds, and I don't really need the extra cores. If you are looking to save some pennies, then I would suggest buying the Ryzen 5 2600x, because if you purchase a new motherboard, then you will likely need an older generation CPU to update the BIOS. I had to purchase a Ryzen 3 1200 to upgrade my motherboard BIOS before anything would post with my third gen CPU. Keep this in mind before purchasing the third gen.

  Six cores twelve threads, its pointless to go for 4C/8T when this does it way better and is more future proof, unless really restricted by budget. or building for granny.Upgrading old Intel core I5 machines with costly S/H I7s is a waste of money, the sellers want 150-200 for old (junk) CPUs when the modern Ryzens are the same price and future proof, esp with a modern mobo.

Great upgrade!

  I needed to update my processor as my son is into gaming.  I read great reviews about AMD so I upgraded to an AMD Ryzen 3 3600X CPU from my old Intel i5-4690K. I found Gigabyte B550 AORUS Elite for the motherboard.  Including a cooler is a huge plus!  The cooler has thermal paste already on it so no need to have some unless you take the cooler off the CPU.Installing the CPU and RAM were easy. Just make sure the CPU arm is fully opened before inserting the processor.  With the Ryzen 3 cooler, I did have to remove the cooler attachment that was already on the motherboard.I don't need to do any benchmarking because I know this is a huge improvement over my old Intel.  For the price, this is a great processor.  I was an Intel fan but AMD is beating Intel.

  Originally I was going to buy the 3700x but after some research the 3600 seemed to peek my interest more, especially for the money.  Decided to spend the extra 20.00 to get the X model since I already was saving 100.00. This cpu replaced my Intel i7 6700k and it really blows it out of the water.  In comparison to when I bought my intel I spent 1/3 the money for a monster upgrade. I matched it with the MSI B450 Tomahawk Max and 16GB Corsair 3200 DDR4.  All 3 of these parts cost me about 50.00 more then I spent on my i7 6700k alone.  Runs great.  Stock cooling fan keeps it at about 44C idle and about 70C while gaming.  Amazing performance for an inexpensive purchase.With a 240mm AIO it sits at about 35C idle and 60C while gaming.

Caused an infinite boot-loop on my build

  So I'm not sure if it is just the one that I got or if it is the compatibility with my board, but this this really tried its best to give me an episode of depression. I built a brand new system and was stuck in a boot-loop and could not get into an OS no matter how many times I tried. I replaced the board, the ram, the ssd, and the problem still persisted. I was so blue after spending the money for a custom build, and I even took it into the shop and they could not find the issue was the CPU either. It was not until I found some forums that mentioned my same issues. I am not sure what causes the issue but it can be worked around. It could have something to do with the trash cpu fan that is given with the CPU but I have to under clock the CPU from the stock 3.8GHz to 3.0 and also reduce the voltage to 1.3000 to get it to boot an OS. I did notice the idle temps were 50C before this also, but you can imagine the frustrations of buying a CPU that is supposed to be able to get 4.2GHz but you have to run it at 3.0GHz just for it to start. Maybe after I change the cooler it will be better.Build Specs:Asus x570 tuf gaming plusTeam Dark Za 2x8gbs 3600 ramAMD Ryzen 3600X CPUZotac GTX 1080 Mini GPUSamsung Evo 970 Plus 1TbFractal Design Ion SFX-L 80+ Gold 500W PSUWifi 6 cardFractal Design Define 7 Compact

Great CPU for gaming right out of the box

  Great CPU if, like myself, you are new to building a gaming PC. While this has the ability to be overclocked, AMD has highly optimized this unit. The minimal gains you can achieve through overclocking manually aren't worth the effort.  The AMD Ryzen Master software is a SUPER simple and noob friendly way to optimize your CPU without having to watch hours of Youtube videos about overclocking. That said, I still watched hours of videos about overclocking, because, why not? Slap this bad boy in and you're off to the races, if you're into racing games. I'm not.

  I've been using this CPU since September of last year, and hands down this cpu does everything far better than I had expected.  I do video games, streaming, productivity, and virtualization and it eats through it all like its butter.  On video games does awesome and with the high quality cpu cooler and the right case the temps stay nice and cold under a heavy work load.  I originally was using a B450 motherboard and upgraded to an x570 motherboard and it was even better due to the motherboard upgrade.  On virtualization of os's I have two and three machines at once and it doesn't even stutter or stumble.If you're looking for an all purpose reasonably priced cpu I would most definitely go for this one or the 3600 without the x.  I have the 3600 in another pc and its just as good just at a cheaper price.  The nice part is the fact that it runs majority of the time at 4 gigahertz on a regular basis.  As a recommendation get the Scythe Mugen 5 Rev:B Cooler for about 55 dollars, its extremely easy to install and does the job with almost no noise.

A beast for the price- but some  heat issues

  I purchased this on a brand new build and installed the wraith spire cooler that came with it.Let me first say, this CPU is a little beast for the price. It's handled everything I've thrown it's way, and it benches extremely well.My only negative is that it ran too hot, even idling, let alone under load, with the wraith spire that came with it. I'd almost suggest AMD NOT put out the wraith spire with it, so people don't think it'll be adequate cooling. I know AMD's chips can run a little hot - and it's typically fine, but I wasn't happy with the temps at all. I had to purchase a liquid cooler to go with it.As far as performance/price goes, it's a no-brainer. Just don't count on the wraith spire being enough to keep temperatures in a really comfortable place. I recommend an alternative aftermarket cooler. A mugen 5 would likely be more than adequate even.

Great CPU but be careful with pins
","

  You probably already know this is a great CPU so instead I will tell you something to watch out for. There are tiny pins on the CPU that are easy to bend, it's a pin grid array design which may be unfamiliar if you are coming from Intel. You have to be very careful from the moment you open the packaging that the CPU doesn't fall and you don't bend pins with your fingers. Another complication is that the latch design that holds the CPU in place is bad and will let the CPU pop out easily when you try to replace the CPU cooler. So you are kind of set up for failure as far as bending pins.

Remember to always do your own thermal

  I'm loving the Ryzen 5 3600X. I used the fan in the box, it's a bit louder than I'm used to, in that I can hear it at all. In the past I've used big air coolers like the old XIGMATEK Gaia SD1283. With the box cooler I can hear a slight hum during gaming, it's not bad, just noticeable. Also the pre-applied thermal compound was very nice and square, but already had particulates embedded. Do yourself and your CPU a favor and remove that with some 99% isopropyl alcohol and a coffee filter, and reapply a new layer. I used a circle cotton pad that my wife had for makeup. Also I like to apply the thermal to the CPU die, it's easier to get a nice clean layer by trimming off the excess that bleeds over the edge while applying, and you can be sure the paste is covering the whole CPU. Remember a little goes a long way, and you want it thin. Don't want stuff coming out the edges between the CPU and cooler when you attach the cooler.

I Bought the Ryzen 5 3600X, For the Wrong Reasons.  I has really worked out well.
","

  I recently became bond to my chair, and was looking to replace an old Intel processor to occupy my days.  About the same time I started looking for computer equipment, AMD announced their new lineup of CPU's.  I admit, I was pretty excited, and made almost every mistake the YouTubers warned us to avoid.Let's just say that I was ready to build a new PC way before AMD was ready for me to build what I wanted.  I generally build a new machine every 5 years, and that was my plan this year.  But, to get to 5 years, I felt I needed an X570 mobo, a Ryzen 9 3900X, 16 gigs of fast Ram, three M.2 drives, and an RTX 2080TI.Reality set in when I could not find a Ryzen 9 3900X, and the price of an RTX 2080TI, damnnnnnn.  So, I changed my direction, and went with a Ryzen 5 3600X and a Vega 56 (which I found new for $270 - PowerColor Red Dragon).My thought was I could start with the 3600X, and resell it when the 3900X's were readily available.  I had heard a lot about the Vega 56 (most of the information was to stay away for the card), but I decided it would be as much fun to play around with the Vega 56 as it would be to game with it.  I think I made a good decision.  My 3600X clock speed is always over 4300+MHz, and usually bounces between 4366MHz and 4399MHz.  I am using an AIO and run the pump at full speed most of the time.The Vega 56 has been a wonderful GPU.  Ok, no ray tracing, but I personally find Global WattMan incredibly easy to use, and I have no problem keeping the clock speed at 1643MHz.  I have not put the Vega 64 bios on my Vega 56 yet, but I plan to soon.I did save some money with my current build.  But, I still hope my wife will get me a Ryzen 9 3900X (I have no interest in the 3950X) for Christmas.  If that does not happen, I will stick with my current CPU, and wait for a RX 5800 XT or RX 5900 XT if they ever come out; otherwise, will wait for the next AM5/6 CPU's when they come out.I really like my rig (highly Frankenstein'd case, with a Gigabyte X570 Aorus Pro Wifi - you can read my mobo review - I like the card very much).  The PC will certainly last for 5 years, but not with me.  I expect that once an AMD GPU with ray tracing becomes available, I will pick one up and sell the Vega 56.  I will also sell my 3600X in a couple of years.  The 3600X will hold its value I expect.It is hard to go wrong with whatever you decide to buy.  Dont over spend and have fun is my only advice.  I may have over spent, but I had a heck of a lot of fun.

I can game comfortably on 1440p with my setup at ultra settings at ~100 FPS in the majority of AAA games.This CPU is at an excellent price point and a nice complement to my setup.

A Worthwhile Upgrade, Especially from a Ryzen 1st Gen, Faster Games, Faster Video Edits
","

  I've been holding off for a long time to upgrade my system, and wanted to avoid spending too much on a CPU that will have a new version out in just a few months. My system had a Ryzen 5 1600 which was pretty solid for gaming, but my main use of this system is for videography and photography. I also have a Radeon RX580 to go along with it. I was having trouble getting smooth editing with 4k footage so I upgraded my CPU and it's helped a ton!I'm not a benchmark guy, so I don't have fancy numbers. What I can say, is that my games and editing run a lot smoother since the upgrade, I'd recommend this chip over a 1st gen for sure!

Price to beat!

  This processor is some of the best value in PC hardware right now. While the standard 3600 is better for the price, the 3600X will sometimes include free games (which is why I purchased it). The 6 cores and 12 threads works great for my two main tasks: streaming and VR gaming. My processor is never a bottleneck for my Vega 56 for gaming (2D and VR) and I have had a very good experience with it so far.

  Can't go wrong with this one. It's a powerhouse for gaming, and unbeatable for the price in productivity. I do have to question if $50 for the X version is justifiable though. I personally went with the X to save myself the time of tweaking and overclocking.Runs a tad hotter than I expected, ~74C with a 240mm AIO running prime95, but still well within specifications. The stock cooler did not fare very well. This is in a rather warm room.Third gen ryzen is pretty much unbeatable right now.

I had 2666 speed ram for the initial upgrade and have since put 3200 ram in my computer.

Great CPU but terrible packaging for the fan
","

  I got this CPU for my first PC build and it works amazingly. It's fast even without overclocking. When I got it though, the plastic shell for the CPU fan was shredded to bits somehow, and the thermal paste got all dry and dirty. Being a PC building noob, I thought I could just clean off the plastic bits and it would be good to go, but the thermal paste didn't work at all and I had to take the fan off, clean off the dried thermal paste, and reapply thermal paste. That is a simple enough process, so just be on the safe side when buying and pick up a tube of thermal paste, you can find one for less than $10. After reapplying the paste the CPU idles around 40-50C, and it rarely gets above 70C even when gaming.

Best value for money (at 200$)

  Got mine for 200$ when the price was down for a short time and boy was it worth it! The thermals of the R5 3600X at idle is slightly better than 3600 (~33.6 C for 3600X vs ~ 39 C for 3600) due to the larger cooler. I have not overclocked it yet (because I'm using the stock cooler) but the CPU will clock up to 4.1 GHz itself in benchmarks. I would say it was worth it at 200$. If you are not comfortable with around 240$ then get a R5 3600, currently at 190$. I'm sure you will be satisfied with it.

  I upgraded from a 10-year old AMD Phenom II to this and obviously the difference is incomparable. All the games and applications that used to struggle to run on my PC are so much faster now with just a motherboard+processor upgrade. Everybody knows that this generation of AMD processor is far better than Intel and it's hard to see why you'd choose anything else. I decided on the 3600x over the 3600 just because the x was on sale and the price difference was $17 between the two, but most people opt for the 3600 at the regular retail price since the 3600 can just be overclocked to reach the same performance as the 3600x.

Good CPU, Mediocre Fan, Bad Packaging

  Running it on an ASUS TUF x570-Plus with 3600MHz RAM. CPU runs great at stock speeds. Bench-marked higher than expected. Temps stay fairly low, event after hours of gaming. Stock fan can get a little whiny during heavy loads, but not enough to be distracting.The only reason I took a star off was because of the packaging, of all things. The thermal paste on the heat-sink came with a scrape on it, as well as some debris. This made for more work than I wanted, given that I was planning on using the stock paste. But the debris was actually a major concern, given that you don't even want the tiniest piece of anything pressed between your CPU and heat-sink.Overall, great CPU though, would definitely recommend to others.

  I've used the 2600X for about a yr and can see without benching, this one will be a bit limited. Indeed it's supposed to be higher speeds, but with the temperature it hits at idle, it's going to depend greatly on your cooling setup. That of course, means forking out more money to bring out it's full potential. Sitting on a Crosshair VII, it performs pretty much the same as my previous; 2600X.

  Reviews of the the whole Ryzen 3000 series stack can be found now (except for the 3950X, which isn't released yet as of this review) and the top of the stack has barely any gaming gains over this processor, so at half the price, the 3600X is a no brainer.As for why I bought the 3600X instead of the 3600: It has a much higher base clock, and a slightly higher boost clock. If you've got a GREAT 3rd party cooling solution, this shouldn't matter too much, as the two processors will boost about the same, and at all times, but the 3600X should run better on the stock cooler with its improved clock speeds.

  This review is for the AMD Ryzen 5 3600X.This is a great value choice for a gaming computer.  Even without over clocking it does well on various bench marks.

  These chipsets are amazing. I bought the 3600x when it came with Borderlands/gamepass because  I was going to get the game anyway. I would advise not buying the 3600x *unless* it comes with a promotion that eliminates the price difference between this and the 3600, as the performance difference is so minimal it's not even worth noting. Absolutely crushing the intel counterparts in price to performance ratio though

Buy the 3600
","

  Great CPU, especially for the money. However, just save some cash and buy the 3600, and use the money saved to buy an after market cooler. This way you can overclock, and still get the same performance as the 3600X. The CPU does have this annoying feature (desgined by AMD) where it pumps voltage to a single core to turbo it up a bit then decreases the voltage. Pulsing the clock speed on a single core up and down. This causes the fan to subsequently rev up and down and can be annoying.

  The ""x"" version has certain advantages over the base model; being better binned and having a better cooler option. The sheer value this CPU provides is incredible. It is without a doubt in my mind that this will be the mainstream processor for years to come. It really is that good. Anything you throw at it, it gladly slogs through like a work horse.

Runs hot, unless you change settings

  This CPU will overheat and run very hot unless you change power settings to power saver otherwise the CPU will turbo up all the time, I recommend this until some update fixes this or unless you have a very good cooler than can handle the CPU turboing all the time but still this raise your energy bill as it turbos on an empty desktop and the CPU will always be hot.

  I wanted to build a small portable 1080p gaming PC to take on work trips and vacation. This CPU is a little powerhouse! I installed on an ASRock B450 with 16gb of 3200 DDR4, GTX 1060 6gb and a 1tb SSD with a 350watt PSU. I used the Velka3 case and packed it all in! I can play everything I throw at it in very high settings. And with a few fan changes it plays very quiet.

These AMD's are pretty good but they're not intel quality.
","

  And AMD will never be Intel quality, their cpus hsve always ran on the ragged edge. I am neither an Intel or AMD fan and I never purchase computer compoments based on price alone. I just got this cheap thing to get revenge on all the half baked AMD processors I've owned in past years. Intel isn't going anywhere, the company is 19 times  larger than AMD and has revenue approaching Microsoft with 110 thousand employees, hell even Asus is 10 times larger than AMD.So stop dreaming about AMD kicking anyones ass, Intel said they were in for two bad years - no one WON anything from their advancement vacancy. This is just a blip in the pc parts timeline.AMD has made a stinking fast and stable cpu here, 3600 - 3600x  get down to business, but to be frank I found the top tier motherboards priced at $500 plus, more than a little off-putting..Y'all have fun arguing with the youtubba fanboys and the vrm intelligentsia, looks like 1999 and fps all over again. Get the processor if you need something cheap and quick. I don't recommend these new motherboards at current prices except when there are specific must have features. Cheers all.

Undervolt this thing!
","

  Well I got this on ebay used for 150bucks and that was pretty much a good deal.First of all performance out of the box is quite amazing. I came from an i5-4690k OC'd to 4.7Ghz from my previous build and it was time to upgrade.And boy was this an upgrade, cinebench R15 scores alone this thing pretty much doubled my 4690k's score out of the box.Although the tricky thing about CPU's nowadays is the overclocking is way different, I used to have 8350 back then and I was able to OC that at 5Ghz on all cores and I remember that CPU when they say boost clock it means all cores boost to that frequency but nowadays when they say ""up to 4.4Ghz"" meaning one of the cores is guaranteed to reach that clock speed but not all cores will. That threw me off since I didn't know that at first.So when I tried to manually clock this at 4.4Ghz thinking it should be able to do it on all cores at the voltage where this CPU gets during stock settings under boost clocks, well.... Let's say that was catastrophic and it wasn't even close to being stable.As I discovered that only 1 core reaches that ""up to"" boost clocks, and learned how to OC this thing I was able to get up to 4.3Ghz but the voltage required is way too much for my taste (1.4v) to get it full stable (prime 95 for at least overnight) and temps were too high as well (98C highest peak,avg at 92C) so I went and downclocked it and eventually landed at 4.1Ghz on all cores and my temperature was comfortable enough for me so I stayed at this clocks but performance wise on cinebench R15 for example is actually lower than the stock clocks..So I did more research and I found that keeping the stock frequency settings and undervolting this thing is the best way to get the performance and temperature. I ended up getting an undervolt of -.54 offset stable and my performance was actually better than stock settings and was boosting at 4.1Ghz on cinebench vs 4.054Ghz on stock settings and on games I was seeing it boost at constant 4.250Ghz. and my temperature was the biggest surprise! it went down by 7degrees overall in idle and under gaming.Overall the only thing I dont like is the ""up to"" boost clock advertising, but other than that it was a great buy. I paired this with Gigabyte Auros Elite motherboard and used Scythe Fuma 2 cooler.

Great CPU. Wraith Spire Cooler is Noisy
","

  The fan on the included Wraith Spire cooler is very audible. If you set the fan curve to keep the CPU cool enough that it doesn't constantly performance throttle, which is the point of cooling, then this CPU fan gets very loud very frequently. It is an unacceptable noise level and was even audible on the other side of gaming comms. If you can hear the fan this easily, you notice everything it does, and it was annoying as it ramped up and down all the time.Fortunately, better CPU coolers are not expensive. I recommend you buy this CPU and upgrade to a larger heat sink with a quieter fan, or other improved cooling solution. This CPU is an amazing amount of power for the money, and it's a great deal even if you don't use the included heat sink.

Excellent Upgrade
","

  I replaced my old i5-6500 with this cpu. It doesn't have integrated graphics, but if you're buying this, you're going to game so you'll have a video card anyway. Where my old i5 used to stutter and hit 100% usage, this thing hovers at around 30-40%. The only thing I miss about my old i5 was how quiet the stock fan was. The fan on the Ryzen 5 is pretty loud when it ramps up, so if noise bothers you, add about $20-$50 for a new fan setup. I don't regret buying this though.

After a few BIOS Updates, a great CPU! Get this!!!!
","

  UPDATE (11/15/2019)With the BIOS ver.  AGESA 1.0.0.3ABBA, all issues seem to have been solved. The CPU voltage properly lowers itself when not being used for intensive tasks. CPU idle temps are a small bit lower but no by much and still jumps to 50C when opening programs or watching a video. However, I think that's just the nature of Ryzen 3rd gen. Runs a bit warmer when not doing intensive tasks, but seems pretty normal during gaming loads. My gaming loads are usually within the 56C - 65C range, depending on ambient temps. Now being Fall, it naturally runs a bit cooler.All in all a fantastic CPU, gave me a 20FPS Jump in the Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark. Game FPS is definitely higher about 10FPS - 20FPS depending on the game ( I upgraded from a 1600x). BUT if you don't pay attention to the FPS, you won't notice a difference. The 1600x is a budget beast in it's own right.(7/23/2019) At the current time of writing this, the AGESA microcode 1.0.0.3BA in current motherboard BIOSES seems to be buggy and will not allow the CPUs to down-volt properly. My 3600x stays 1.45volts and above. 1.4 is high enough as it is and brings in extra heat to the CPU so my CPU idles at 40C to 50C in a 75C ambient temp. With the higher temps also comes performance loss since the CPU will have to downclock to preserve itself.On stock settings it seems to perform ok, but when you try to under-volt there's even  more performance loss.I've tested this on 3 different coolers (stock, water, and giant air cooler) and also with 2 different motherboards. All produce the same or similar results.So if you want to jump in now and get a Ryzen 3rd gen cpu, be aware that you might run into this issue. I recommend waiting 2 to 3 months so they can iron out these issues.

  No but really, this is amazing, I am running a b350 motherboard, yes a b350 one which was paired with a 1600x , and this beast not only runs at full power on this board but is leaving the 1600x in the dust!.  its a lot hotter so take that in mind, and it comes with its bugs on the b350 board but so far its amazing,  with my 1070 I am hitting constants 144fps on all my games, simulation games even where I was having issues.This is just the best, 10/10 would have gotten the 3700x if it was in stock.I attached pictures of a benchmark on war thunder, the bios screen on the b350 board, a benchmark on cinebench r15 and cinebench r20, r15 goes up to  1570 points, while cinebench r20 goes up to 3544 points. Those scores were with 2x8gb (dual channel) 2400mhz c15 ram.  Impressive

  Loving this processor.. came in yesterday and she has been doing great. The single core boost is truly amazing. 6 cores and 12 threads is just what I needed for my needs in gaming.This processor was shipped and sold by AMD authorized reseller. There was a rumor going around saying they were scammers because their page shows nothing about a processor. I freaked out but when I called Amazon, they got them on a 3 way call and we settled it out. AMD authorized reseller was very nice and understandable and confirmed they were not scammers and their page is a bought store front from another seller to my understanding. I was very pleased with my 3600x. I cannot wait to see what else AMD comes out with. I'm excited for the future and it's a great time in the PC world.

Strong performance, consider a cooler upgrade
","

  Bought as part of an upgrade to my rig over Black Friday. Only reason I went with the X variant rather than the plain 3600 was price at the time. Only a ~$15 difference so I chose this for potentially better binning. Otherwise I would have chosen the 3600.Rock solid reliable so far, much better performance than my previous setup that was quickly falling behind due to its age (~6 years old at the time of replacement). Able to overclock, as with all Ryzen chips which is a huge plus.A gripe that I do have is with the stock cooler, though I guess that should've been expected. At stock speeds, the fan was quite loud, and was barely able to keep my chip under 80C which is too high for me. After picking up a Hyper 212 to cool this chip, everything is well.

  NOTE: I bought on sale for a few dollars more than a non-x edition. If the price difference is huge, the non-x edition is the way to go for your budget.Do the research, this is arguably the best value for an overall processor. It by no means is the best processor out there, but for what you pay you get one heck of a deal. I use for casual 1080p/1440p gaming and I’ve had no issues.
