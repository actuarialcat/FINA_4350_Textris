Then it was something like the i5 2500K.  I was actually quite shocked about how much quicker the i5 was over my old Q6600, which itself absolutely wiped the floor with my even older AMD 4400+ chip. \n\nI'm kind of interested in whats coming next, could anyone point me at some good articles about what Intel has planned for the years ahead.
