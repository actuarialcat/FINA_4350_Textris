I don't mind building a computer from scratch or buying a refurbished machine, as long as it is guaranteed to support a Xeon Phi, and the stats of the host's hardware really don't matter much for my particular use case (porting and preliminary bench testing of a software platform).

So an overview: On my main gaming PC I was running an AMD FX-8350 with a very mild overclock to 4.3ghz. It had 8GB of G.SKILL Ripjaw ram, an Asus 7970, and an Asus M5A99X EVO motherboard. My wife's computer was running and i5-2310, the same 8GB ram, a Sapphire 7970, using a Gigabyte GA-B75M-D3P motherboard.\n\nMy wife does a lot of Photoshop, Lightroom and video editing work, so I wanted her to have something better than the lower end i5 she had, so I found a pretty cheap used 3770. Since I've heard so many times that the i5's and especially the i7's destroy the 8350, I decided to switch some parts around and get the best gaming rig I could make. So now my wife is using the 8350 with the Asus motherboard and I'm using the 3770 with the Gigabyte motherboard. Other than that, everything else is the same. The same ram, the same Asus 7970, and the same hard drives.\n\nSo for whatever reason, I'm noticing a ton of frame skips in practically everything. I first noticed it while playing Shadow of Mordor. With the 8350 it was perfectly smooth without ever having frame skipping, now with the 3770 I get frame skips every few minutes. I even notice frame skips when I'm just navigating XBMC, which makes me feel like something is wrong. It's not all negative though, when using the Dolphin emulator, although I still have frame skipping, the overall performance is better than using the 8350, it's just that I'm getting frame skips now in games where I never did using the 8350.\n\nHopefully I'm using the right term to describe my issue. The frame rate is very smooth and steady, and then all of a sudden it pauses, and then starts again in about 1-2 secs but also a number of frames ahead of where it was. I have a decent cooler on it and the motherboard bios is the latest version. My own diagnosis was that this CPU has an un-fixable hardware problem or this motherboard is somehow causing it, since these are the only 2 parts that are different.\n\nSo those are my thoughts, just hoping to get some other opinions.
