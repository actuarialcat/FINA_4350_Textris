Please feel free to correct if you know more - and also feel free to explain in more detail if you like!  This post will deal only with SMT and it's current implementation in modern Intel (Nehalem and later) and AMD (Bulldozer and later) cpus, not with software threads, programming, IPC, clock speeds, or anything else, although some other terms dealing with cpus will be used out of necessity.\n\nSo you're thinking of buying that shiny new CPU to power your next computer.  Dual-Core and Quad-Core CPUs are the norm.  Fancy features like 'Hyper Threading' seem promising, and some even have **OMG EIGHT CORES**.  How do you choose one, and what are the differences?\n\nFirst, let's explore what a 'Core' is in a CPU.  A good place to start is with a simplified diagram of Intel's current [Haswell CPU architecture] (http://www.google.com/imgres?client=firefox-a&amp;hs=WBW&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=1076&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=SZfi-Jz3E8AlWM%3A&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Freview%2Fintel-haswell-core-i7-4770k-review-dz87kl75k-motherboard%2F&amp;docid=HuQ3Le2H0J8V0M&amp;imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn2.wccftech.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F05%2FIntel-Haswell-Core.jpg&amp;w=1739&amp;h=1084&amp;ei=-rnQUuPvL8PxoASGl4CQAg&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=0CFgQhBwwAg&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=15906&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=30).  This shows roughly what the layout of a current chip like an i5 4670 looks like.  You'll notice four 'cores' in the the diagram.  These are where the work is done on the CPU (where the instructions are processed), and they themselves are composed of many different pieces.  Here's [another good diagram] (http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architecture/8) showing what those pieces are.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, here is a layout for an [AMD FX-8350] (http://www.overclockersclub.com/reviews/amd_fx8350/images/vishera_6.htm) with eight 'cores'.  There is an important distinction to be made here in how AMD lays out it's 'cores'.  Instead of having an individual 'core' like Intel, AMD creates what they call a 'module' that is composed of two 'cores'.  So to create a quad-core CPU in AMD's world, they really have a CPU with two 'modules', rather than simply four 'cores' as Intel would.  Here's a diagram of a [Piledriver 'module'] (http://images.anandtech.com/doci/5831/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-14%20at%2010.38.35%20PM.png).\n\nOkay, so now we can see how the CPU is laid out and know a bit about what a core is and what is in a 'core' in a CPU.  There are three important parts for this discussion and the first are 'Integer Units' which are also referred to as ALUs (arithmetic logic units) and/or EUs (simply, Execution Units).  Integer Units do what the name suggests - [integer math] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).  It's also important to note that the majority of the work the processor does is Integer Math. If I've got my information correct, Intel's cores currently have two Integer Units each, while AMD's modules have four Integer Units each, with each of the 'cores' in a module having two.  This will be an important point as we illustrate how each company implements SMT in it's CPUs.\n\nThe next important piece to consider in the functioning of SMT in these CPUs is what is called the 'Floating Point Unit', or FPU.  In olden times, you could add a 'Math Co-Processor' to your 286 which would allow it to do fancy things like [Floating Point Math] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point), which for simplicity sake we'll just say made your computer much faster when a piece of software wanted to do some floating point math.  Building the FPU directly into the CPU has been a standard practice at both Intel and AMD for quite some time now.  The important bit about the FPU when it comes to SMT is in it's built into the CPU and how many are in the CPU.  In an Intel CPU, again if I've got my info correct, there is a 'Full' (256-bit) FPU in each and every core.  In an AMD CPU, each of the two 'cores' has essentially half an FPU (128-bit), that can combine to function as one 256-bit FPU.  So each 'module' has four Integer Units, but only one 'Full' Floating Point Unit.  You can see that this means that a quad-core (two module) AMD CPU has eight Integer Units, but only two 'Full' Floating Point Units.  A quad-core Intel CPU will also have eight Integer Units, but four Floating Point Units instead of two.  This can make a significant difference in performance in some cases although it is by no means crippling, as evidenced by the performance of the respective processors.\n\nSo now we get a fairly confusing part, what is called the ['Front End'] (http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architecture/6) on modern CPU's.  There are no execution units here, but rather pieces that store instructions for processing or translate those instructions from one form to another for faster/simplified/parallel processing.  The important bit (the one I consider most important anyhow) of the 'Front End' are the Decoders.  Most of what a Decoder does in a CPU is receives an [x86 instruction] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) and changes it into what is being called a 'Micro-Op' by Intel, which without going too deep really means that modern x86 CPUs don't do x86 instructions, and that the Decoder is essentially translating the old and inefficient x86 language into the current machine language that modern 'x86' processors use.  I don't know how that magic works, but it does.  What is also relevant about Decoders is the number in a CPU made by each respective company, and that number relates directly the way SMT works in their CPUs.\n\nIntel accomplishes their Hyper-Threading feature, or SMT, essentially by equipping a core with two decoders instead of one.  Why is this important and how does it work?  Intel explains it [here] (http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-hyper-threading-technology-your-questions-answered), and I'll take a shot of making some more sense of it.  Each Intel core can work on up to 4 instructions per clock cycle ideally (although this doesn't happen often).  However, most software is 'single threaded', which means that very often it will give the processor one instruction, and then wait for that instruction to be completed before sending another.  So you could look at that possibility of 4 instructions per clock in the hardware as being a waste - but Intel lies to the software with it's two decoders.  It tells the software that one core is actually two, essentially inviting another 'thread', or series of software instructions to come use it.  So one core attempts to work on two sets of instructions simultaneously, and in many cases it can.  It can do this because most of the time the instructions do not need to use the same execution units at the same time, so one Integer Unit can do work while at the same time the other one, or maybe the FPU, can also be productive.  Ideally, double the work would be done each clock cycle, but most of the time that is not the case.  Hyper-Threading allows an Intel core to take on more instructions at one time allowing it to be more efficient.  There is another added benefit here - let's assume that you only have software that is single-threaded, you can still benefit from Hyper-Threading when you need to use a lot of different software simultaneously, such as having your web browser running while also using Skype, Excel, and an anti-virus program.  The types of instructions that can be done simultaneously is also quite good on an Intel processor - remember that each core has it's own 'Full' FPU.  Intel also gets the benefit of being able to sell processors with Hyper-Threading for more money with very little added cost to making the chip that has it as opposed to one that does not.\n\nAMD implements SMT in a different way, via brute force more or less.  Each core has it's two Integer Units and a Decoder, but in practice shares the FPU with the core next to it.  Each module also shares quite a bit more of the 'Front End' resources than the individual cores do in the Intel designs.  Also for the most part each core is capable of only 2 instructions per clock (in special cases 3).  Rather than really doubling the cores, AMD has essentially created a four Integer Unit, one FPU, two Decoder core and called it two cores.  Much like an i5 4770, with the FX-8xxx CPUs AMD is really selling a quad-core chip that can run eight threads, but one that does it less efficiently in many cases.  There is another issue - AMD needs to build an entire module (five execution units) to run two threads, Intel only needs to build one core (three execution units).  Not only is AMD not making as efficient use of their execution units, they aren't making as efficient use of processor die area/number of transistors, and by extension, less efficient use of their manufacturing.  With refinement they can catch up, but overall the brute for approach does not appear to be working as well.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "intel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm1b", "thumbnail": "self",

"[Link](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57617372-92/intel-ceo-talks-delayed-factory-broadwell-production-start/)  \n\n* **Fab42 delay** -- PC growth did not play out: \"We have to start construction projects three years roughly in advance. They're very complex. If you go back three years ago, our view of the PC industry, PC growth was much more robust than what has played out,\" Krzanich said. \n* **Next-gen Broadwell chip**: The company expects Broadwell -- the successor to the current Haswell used in PCs -- production to start later in the first quarter. Broadwell's release: \"still second half of 2014. Squarely on target.\"   \n* **New tablet chips**: SoFIA and Broxton chips are coming that will lower the system-level (as opposed to chip-level) costs. \n* **Tablet unit target of 40 million**: Intel expects to see 40 million tablets ship with Intel processors in 2014. Krzanich said he's confident this will happen. \n* Desktop and gaming market strong: The company saw record shipments of Core i7 desktop chips, according to Krzanich.
