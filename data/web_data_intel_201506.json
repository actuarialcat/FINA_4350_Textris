I couldn't troubleshoot at home which item wasn't working (I was able to test every other component in another rig) because I had no processor or motherboard that had the 1155 socket. So I shipped the motherboard back to intel using the overnight security deposit method. When I plugged everything in, the PC worked temporarily till I turned it off and back on and the same thing happened (it wouldn't post at all, black screen). So I naturally believed it was the processor. I had it sent back to Intel through UPS. According to the tracking number, the package got there on the 22nd of May and I only got confirmation they (intel) are shipping it back to me TODAY. Get this, this coincidentally happens after I shoot them an email the other day asking what's wrong? They didn't say anything, they just gave me the tracking information. I haven't been able to track warrenty status because my email wasn't found on the site, that's what the email was asking about and they still haven't responded to my question about why my email isn't in there system for warranty requests.\n\n\nSo anywho, anyone have something like this happen to them? They said 5-7 business days, it's been about 10 now. Does it take that long to figure out if a processor doesn't work?

better deal then the other and such. So i was wondering if someone could either explain the big differnces between some of the main I7 models and or post a link that explains it all. I tried googling for abit and some of it either went over my head or didn't seem like what i was looking for. I of course found lists where it compares test scores people did on them and such or it lists ever little detail about each of them (but some were missing info). So here i am to ask which ones are better, and why? what makes them different from each other. I know that if it has K at the end it means it is unlocked, but do sockets change? How many cores? im sure the clock speeds change, but what about the caches? which ones would you guys recommend?   thanks for any help you guys can give!

I've been tasked with recommending a computer for my coworkers' church and we've (tentatively) decided on getting a NUC.  I'll give the quick and dirty backstory, and then the requirements.\n\nStory:  Small church.  Computer is currently an old industry surplus laptop (his description places it at 15-20 years old, came out of an old factory, doesn't even have a built in NIC) and is used to display power point presentations via a (presumably long) VGA cable to a monitor in the lobby area.  Computer itself sits in a loft-ish area? **I haven't been to the church myself yet, so I'm only going off his description**\n\nNecessary use:  Display pictures and power points in a slideshow format.  Preferable to have remote access (I'm thinking RDP, but might use TeamViewer or VNC).  He also wants to play videos on it from time to time.\n\nSince it's in a loft/cubby area, most management/control would be done remotely.  I was going to sell an old laptop of mine but they decided to move forward with the NUC suggestion instead.\n\nI'm computer savvy and don't need hand holding.  I'm just new to small form factor machines (aside from Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's) and could use some help deciphering all the different model numbers and god knows what else.  What I'm thinking would satisfy his requirements would be:\n\n* i3 processor.  No more than an i5, since we're operating on a very limited budget.\n\n* 4-8GB RAM\n\n* WiFi is preferred since I have no idea how their network is laid out.\n\n* Built in Intel HD graphics is fine.  Enough to play a .mp4 or .avi file from time to time.\n\n* Going to install a 120GB SSD and MS Office.  That's all it'll be used for.\n\n* **Budget** - No more than $350 at *most* for everything -- NUC, RAM, SSD, OS and any necessary office license.  Pushing it, I know.  Won't need Office 2013 -- 2010 will be plenty if we can find it on Amazon or somewhere else cheap.\n\nI think that's everything.  If I left anything out, please ask and I'll clarify.  I'm planning to go to the church this Saturday with him and get a feel for the setup before continuing research.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "intel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm1b", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can someone help me choose a NUC?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/3a8m5w/can_someone_help_me_choose_a_nuc/"}, {"author": "J2quared", "author_created_utc": 1412440427, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ipbb6", "created_utc": 1434598265, "domain": "self.intel", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/3a8tv1/if_skylake_is_indicated_by_a_6_for_sixth_gen_what/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3a8tv1", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/intel/comments/3a8tv1/if_skylake_is_indicated_by_a_6_for_sixth_gen_what/", "retrieved_on": 1440663415, "score": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "intel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm1b", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If Skylake is indicated by a 6 (for sixth gen) what architecture is used in 5th gens?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/3a8tv1/if_skylake_is_indicated_by_a_6_for_sixth_gen_what/"}, {"author": "Beeardo", "author_created_utc": 1411590149, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ik2rm", "created_utc": 1434620967, "domain": "self.intel", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/3a9oon/pentium_g3258_or_i3_4160/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3a9oon", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 30, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/intel/comments/3a9oon/pentium_g3258_or_i3_4160/", "retrieved_on": 1440663016, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Title.

The AC7260 has been acting particularly strange today because I have reached speeds I have never seen before but it is still bad because it doesn't hold steady. The Mbps swings wildly between 9.5Mbps to 65Kbps. Sometimes the rate holds steady at ~8Mbps but it eventually winds up in the very low end. I rolled back the drivers to what was initially installed on my ASUS g751 laptop and maybe that was what resulted in this \"improvement\" because when I used the newest drivers on Intel's website the download rate held steady at ~2.5Mbps.\n\nI googled this problem and read up on how to tweak and improve download rates. For instance, I enabled VMM and that helped a bit but the rate still swings wildly. I am also on HT mode which has better results than VHT. \n\nEventually, I got fed up with the whole thing and bought an Edimax 150Mbps USB card which still kind've sucks but at least the download rate is consistently at ~2.0Mbps. \n\nHowever, on my Macbook air I consistently get 10Mbps on the same network. What is going on and can anyone help me out here?\n\nTell me if you need more information.

This made the fan go from around 3000 RPM to 1800 RPM  when idle which helped a great deal. However, the BIOS setting I found was still very aggressive in cooling the unit (even with CPU temp at only around 45 Celsius), so when the NUC had some load the fan would speed up quickly and make noise. \n\nI have now installed SpeedFan (free fan control software) and configured the fan to run at minimum 20% speed (around 1800 RPM), a desired CPU temperature of 50 Celsius, and max temperature of 60 Celsius. I have yet to test it extensively, but it seems to work quite well as my CPU is now hovering around the 50C mark.\n\nI have tried to find good information on the following but haven't really found it - any insights  much appreciated:\n\n1) What's the (highest) CPU temperature I should be targeting in an idle state? \n\n2) What's the max CPU temperature that is tolerable?\n\n3) Should I worry about the temperature of other components?  (The NUC has only one fan anyway). \n\n4) What's the minimum 'duty cycle' I should run the fan at? I'm currently running at 20% / 1800 RPM minimum. I read that setting it too low could make it stop altogether. Intel says themselves they have not tested it below 40% and therefore can only recommend this 40% level.
