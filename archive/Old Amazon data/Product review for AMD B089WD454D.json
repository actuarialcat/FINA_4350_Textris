But holy cow this thing is fast. The 12 cores each have two threads, so you really have 24 CPUs that you can run 12 at a time -- sort of. The boost tech seems to work great.Get a water cooler. From what I understand, the Tdie measurement is a spot measurement from the chip that reflects the highest-reading temp at that moment. So it will run hotter than the socket temperature (65C on the die vs 42C on the socket, for example). I first installed and had a gap in my heat sink compound and it was running successfully at 80C on the socket but would eventually shut itself down.Good value. Will probably get cheaper soon as new chips appear.
