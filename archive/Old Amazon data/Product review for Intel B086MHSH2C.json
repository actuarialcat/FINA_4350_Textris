With my custom water cooling loop, and a z490 motherboard I\u2019m running 5.1Ghz overclock, with 5.0Ghz all core overclock(standard all core is like 4.3Ghz I believe). Under a stress test my cpu temps do peak around 80C, though all my gaming loads have peaked temps around 50-60C.The only hitch I had ordering this processor from Dealzone distributorswas that the package was sent with \u201csignature required\u201d upon delivery option, and they were unable to change that. I work daylight hours so had a high chance of missing the delivery window. They(the seller) did at least promptly reply even though it was a holiday weekend. I ended up making a fedex account to change the delivery to \u201cpick up at local fedex location\u201d instead of delivery to my home because of the signature requirement.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3S92NKBUW94JM", "asin": {"original": "B086MHSH2C", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020", "date": {"date": "September 13, 2020", "unix": 1599962400}, "name": "Seth", "rating": 5, "title": "Fantastic!", "review": "Paired with an Asus TUF z490 chipset & Corsair CAS14 DDR4-3200 I can push mine to 5.2ghz with stability.
