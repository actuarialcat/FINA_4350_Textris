This CPU has only minor differences than the newer 5 3600 and its alot cheaper! Honestly very happy with it! Have this installed in a Asus Rog Strix B450-f motherboard and didn't even have to update the bios! Did not feel the need to overlook and go through all the watercooling and worrying about heat. If you want a nice budget build grab that Asus board, this CPU, and a Sapphire Radeon 580X and start gaming. I did a complete build for 550 case and all and for 1080 gaming you can't beat it, especially for just a plug and play build!", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3D5CLP59I8PTL", "asin": {"original": "B07B428V2L", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 3, 2020", "unix": 1604368800}, "name": "jordan krolczyk", "rating": 5, "title": "Great CPU", "review": "Put this is my partners gaming rig.

I paired it up with 16gb of ram @ 3000mhz and everything holds up and plays well. It's perfect for playing at 1080p in Ultra settings. My kids do Fortnite, Rocket League, Fall Guys and other silly games that are out there and so far this CPU is working perfectly. It does get a little toasty but nothing crazy or extremely hot that will cause it to fail or crash. I recommend this if you're into 1080p gaming.
