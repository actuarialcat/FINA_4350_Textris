Installation was fairly straightforward, and I\u2019ve used it to create a file and picture/video server for our home network.It took a day and a half to transfer about 600gb from several external hard drives. Once you get the hang of navigating the folders and how it behaves when copying files you can be a bit more efficient with the process. There are several apps, and although I haven\u2019t had much time to dive in, it appears the DS Photo and Memories apps function very similar to iCloud photo roll.
