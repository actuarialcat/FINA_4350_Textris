It is cheap ( I got it for $~80), and so is perfect for budget builds. It is not very powerful in any aspects, the Vega 8 or the CPU itself, however it did handle games. It handles fortnite on low at about 30-40 fps 1080p, and valorant on high at 60 fps. I would recommend on black friday picking up a 2700x or 3600 x or xt and a proper GPU as it will greatly increase performance.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R1OJEOCN1EKPPO", "asin": {"original": "B079D3DBNM", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 28, 2020", "unix": 1603850400}, "name": "Dirk Jewitt", "rating": 5, "title": "Now that there are newer APU options, get one of those.

I\u2019m really surprised that these didn\u2019t catch on with consumers more. These would be perfect in An OEM as long as gaming wasn\u2019t a concern. Even then you could get a cheap rx 570 and have yourself a better1080p gaming PC. For everyday use, Ryzen APU\u2019s can\u2019t be beat for the price to performance you get.
