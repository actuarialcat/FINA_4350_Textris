I run 2x8GB DDR4 3200 SO-DIMM with it at XMP settings. Played with OC'ing the RAM and video crashed at around 3600, forcing me to hard reset the unit. No huge performance differences, besides instability over 3333.The system is more quiet than my Dell business laptop. I get mid 40C temps during everyday tasks. Mid 50c temps while \"gaming\" ... Mid 70s temps while ripping DVDs via USB (hottest I've gotten this chip).GNOME desktop animations are seamless. Animations of icons that have stuttered on my laptops are seamless on my 1440p monitor.When I say 'gaming' I am not on the newest AAA. I play Guild Wars 2 (2012) at low-med settings, at 1440p. It performs surprisingly well - ~50fps. I also play Everquest (Project1999) but honestly I can play that on any PC I own. I've tried to play Total War: Warhammer via Steam with horrible fps so far.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R1GAVSD2RMAEL3", "asin": {"original": "B0815JGFQ8", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 15, 2020", "unix": 1602727200}, "name": "Travis Moore", "rating": 5, "title": "Low power, reliable, and efficient cpu", "review": "I put this in a 450 chipset motherboard and slightly overclocked it.What a fantastic little CPU!Put some good memory and strong motherboard behind it, and watch your office productivity fly.Excellent CPU, and I will be buying another.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R1CN4I1J23R1MF", "asin": {"original": "B0815JGFQ8", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020", "date": {"date": "October 8, 2020", "unix": 1602122400}, "name": "Ramses Tavares", "rating": 5, "title": "Good enough", "review": "Good purchase for what it is.
