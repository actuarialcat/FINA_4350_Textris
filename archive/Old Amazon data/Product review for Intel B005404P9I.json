But it does have 2 requirements:", "review": "Easily the best CPU I've ever put in a gaming rig. It can be overclocked, and I can push mine up to 5.0Ghz. Even runs Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 seamlessly on Ultra graphics. I use three 1080p monitors and often have a dozen different programs running at once, sometimes multiple AAA games simultaneously. This thing delivers.Make sure you buy a good cooler. I can't stress this enough. I use a top-mounted radiator cooler, but a closed liquid loop will work too if you're up for it. Stay away from fans unless you have a monstrous amount of airflow with the intake/exhaust fans. This CPU gets really, really hot. It will do anything you ask of it, but be prepared for the thermal energy involved with all that computing.Also, ensure you have a good power supply unit. I had to upgrade mine from 750 to 1200 to be able to run my i9-9900k and my 2070 Super GPU. Before, it didn't even supply enough power to turn on my graphics card. Now, I can OC both without any issue.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2GF65M6RN7J9A", "asin": {"original": "B005404P9I", "variant": "B005404P9I"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020", "date": {"date": "November 4, 2020", "unix": 1604455200}, "name": "Josh", "rating": 5, "title": "Best chip ever", "review": "This is the greatest processor on the market.
