That means no display whatsoever without a discrete GPU. But this is good if you were doing a separate GPU anyway (and keeps the chip cheap).* No fan/heatsink included. If you're building an enthusiast system, that encourages you to pick something other than the so-so, noisy devices that were shipped with older Intel processors.* 6-core is substantial enough, since most desktop use isn't highly threaded (other than on the GPU).* 4.6 GHZ turboboost can't apply to all cores, but when just one core is pegged, it can go notably faster than the 3.7 GHZ base clock.* K series chips can be overclocked (\"unlocked\") with the appropriate moboWhat's to not like:* Not much architectural change from 8th gen products (or 7th gen). It's the same 14nm process as 6th gen.* Intel keeps changing the processor sockets, so we have to keep buying new motherboards.* Runs fairly hot / high TDP by modern standards.Although this 9th-gen Intel CPU is not remarkably different from the 3 generations preceding it, and most of the buzz today is over the top-end processors and the competition with AMD and ARM... there's still many times you just want a basic, well-priced x86-64 processor, not the expensive headline grabbers.This one hits the price-performance point for your typical hobbyist or gamer.
