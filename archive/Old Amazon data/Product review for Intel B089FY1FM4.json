The microphone is not very responsive. We use it with Zoom and it does not pickup up very well or very quickly.3. The battery is really undersized. You get a few hours of use before plugging in. I bought a power brick to help.I question whether I should have moved up to the business oriented Dell laptop to avoid the issues above, but the extra $1000 or so for one of those makes putting up with these issues ok.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R3L14A7RNUQ7D", "asin": {"original": "B089FY1FM4", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020", "date": {"date": "July 14, 2020", "unix": 1594692000}, "name": "GME ", "rating": 5, "title": "Great computer for work.", "review": "Everything was easy to install.
