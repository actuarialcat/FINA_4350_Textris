I used it to replace my older i7-4790K and Asus Sabertooth z97 main board and I can definitely feel a difference.Multiform processing is solid at stable overstock speeds set by Asus Ai, the Air automation is pretty good, although expect a few crashes while it determines the optimal settings for your processor. Having a liquid cooler is also good idea for this combo, the new Corsair h100i RGB capellix cooler is a good choice and keeps my setup at 31-41 degrees Celsius depending on load.Aura Synce works ok, but has some quirks with various lighting controllers, seems to link with corsair iCUE, so thats a plus.Overall I am happy with this combo purchase and have had no issues", "verified_purchase": false}]}
