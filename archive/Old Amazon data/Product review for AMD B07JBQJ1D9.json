I was skeptic, but man, was it money well spent. This machine is a beast. I run a software company from my home, write programs, use AutoCAD and enjoy video games. This processor handles everything. Many times I need multiple computers to test different operating systems for my products. This processor can handle everything I have thrown at it, without even one single time of slow down in a year! One time, I was running five different operating systems IN THE BACKGROUND for a week, and didnt notice. I also believe, in that year time, I have only turned off my computer about 24 hours total. The only time it is shut down is for required updates, which takes one restart, and then it is back up.The only downside I had with this processor was there was no clear instructions on how to install it. There are two sleeves on this processor, and I thought there was only one. It took me a while of saying, 'Why doesnt this fit?' before I realized I had to REMOVE the outer sleeve and KEEP the inner sleeve. Made no since. But, it worked out in the end.I cannot express how happy this processor has made me. This processor is well worth the money.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R31D0Y64G3OYHH", "asin": {"original": "B07JBQJ1D9", "variant": "B07JBQJ1D9"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020", "date": {"date": "April 13, 2020", "unix": 1586743200}, "name": "Robert Brubaker", "rating": 5, "title": "Great for rendering animation.", "review": "I purchased this processor for rendering animation.
