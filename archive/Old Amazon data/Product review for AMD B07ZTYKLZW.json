Sometimes an incremental build with clang++/ccache takes more than 15 minutes on it.So, I decided to build a workstation on my own! I googled different CPUs and I chose Ryzen 3950x. The whole setup ended up costing around $1500 because I never play video games, so I only paid like $40 for the graphics card.And this thing is just so fast! Comparing a laptop with a desktop isn't necessarily fair, but 3950x never requires more than 30 seconds for an incremental build which sometimes took 15 minutes on a MBP. A 30-way clean build finishes in 3.5 minutes, which is roughly 7-8 times faster than my MBP because it used to take 20-30 minutes! I never expected that I'd be able to build such a fast machine for much less money!
