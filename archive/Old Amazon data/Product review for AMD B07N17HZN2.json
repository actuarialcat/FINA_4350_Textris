Thermaltake has some of the worst software I have ever used for RGB. It is not only ugly but confusing to use. Besides the RGB software it is a good product and I would purchase it again. I use it for my 10850k and it keeps my temps cool and I have never heard the fans.The thermaltake fans can be annoying to set up because of how long the cables are and how it looks like a birds nest unless you do a really well thought out cable run through the pc with good cable management. I had to redo my cable runs twice for me to be happy with the looks.I didn't leave a rating for Warmth because I am not sure what that is supposed to mean.

Doesn\u2019t really seem to cool any better than when I was air cooled but I don\u2019t over heat so it works.

Biggest dislikes are the lack of their own software for the pump control and the fans have different connections than other thermaltake fans I purchased so a extra interface was required to get all the lights to sync.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R300P231IINZL7", "asin": {"original": "B07N17HZN2", "variant": "B07N9K44Y8"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020", "date": {"date": "September 15, 2020", "unix": 1600135200}, "name": "Frank", "rating": 3, "title": "Wonderful.. except for the RGB", "review": "I purchased this model in 12/2019 from a competing triple-egg website.WARMTH:This AIO does a great job keeping my CPU temperatures in check. It performs as well as you might expect from an Asetek.INSTALLATION:The unit was easy to install. The headers have a proprietary shape that makes it clear which way they should be plugged in.NOISE:There is a gentle hum from the pump if I bring my head within 6 inches of the case. I have a closed case, so I don't notice any sound from my usual distance (2 feet from my computer case) when I'm sitting normally. I only really hear the fans/pump for the first 5 seconds running at 100% when I turn on the PC.ARGB:The lights looked great! Until they malfunctioned after 6 months. The lighting on the pump is off-colored. It can no longer display uniform colors except for green. The attached picture is what happens when I have the color set to white. I believe the red/blue lights in the top portion of the pump have stopped working, as the pump has no problem displaying green. Every other color setting for the top portion of the pump will either flash green or not light up at all.The fans that came with the AIO are great. I don't hear them, the colors are vibrant, and the airflow is strong (based on sticking my hand behind the fans).I am satisfied with every part of this cooler except for the broken ARGB in the pump. My decision to pay the price premium for this AIO over its competitors was based solely on the ARGB feature. Similar performing 360 AIOs without ARGB can be had for roughly 2/3 of the price of the Thermaltake 360 ARGB Sync. Two stars were removed because that is roughly the value of the ARGB that stopped working for me. This product earned three stars because its performance is fine. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing this for the ARGB feature, as the longevity of that feature was short-lived for me.", "verified_purchase": false}, {"id": "R1GG2Q3YHN957D", "asin": {"original": "B07N17HZN2", "variant": "B07N9K44Y8"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020", "date": {"date": "September 8, 2020", "unix": 1599530400}, "name": "Nick Eubanks", "rating": 5, "title": "This is one of the best AIO coolers available", "review": "I had to replace my previous AIO due to a radiator leak and based on the reviews ordering this one. It looks awesome and the fans are basically silent. The pump itself extremely quite when run at 100%. On that note, be sure to configure the fan connector this plugs into on the motherboard to run at 100% always.
