I am also a 3D artist, more specifically a character modeler. Maya is central to my workflow so I was sadden when I saw a review about how this CPU is a good BUT not optimized for maya. I'm not here to discredit that person, in fact, I'm adding on to his review. While it may be true that unfold3D processing error was an issue in the past, it has been resolved with a maya2020.2 patch and there is a way to fix it in maya 2019 (what I use). I also would probably suggest an intel processor if don't want any weird processor related maya errors but if you can't pass up this beast of a processor then I'm happy to tell you that it can work.", "verified_purchase": false}, {"id": "R1Q78VA6NRYRS1", "asin": {"original": "B0815JGCXP", "variant": "B0815JGCXP"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020", "date": {"date": "August 23, 2020", "unix": 1598148000}, "name": "Ray W.", "rating": 5, "title": "Powerful, and relatively great value vs. its competition", "review": "Using this chip in an all-purpose rig: software development, gaming, virtualization, ...and this chip handles all of it without breaking a sweat.Relatively great value compared to the i9-10980XE when taking the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and cooler into account.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "R2ZHPU8NU2ZETE", "asin": {"original": "B0815JGCXP", "variant": "B0815JGCXP"}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2020", "date": {"date": "August 10, 2020", "unix": 1597024800}, "name": "J.
