The 10400 is currently a better value at $180, than the 10500/10600 at $240/$260. Although I couldn't bring myself to buy the 10400 with \"only\" a 2.9 gHZ base clock.But the extra few hundred mHZ on the 10500/10600 won't move the needle much in terms of performance according to 3rd party benchmarking.If you want more performance, the 10600K unlocked could be an option at around $275, but goes best with a Z490 motherboard for overclocking.Overall, however, the 10500 has met my expectations this far.", "verified_purchase": true}, {"id": "RLUFSVWBFSSRE", "asin": {"original": "B086MW76DW", "variant": ""}, "review_data": "Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020", "date": {"date": "August 8, 2020", "unix": 1596852000}, "name": "Josh", "rating": 5, "title": "Great for high-end productivity desktop", "review": "I bought this to build a computer for a friend.

After a lot of research, I found this to be the best Intel processor for the price.Performance rivals the i7 or even the i9 on frame rates for most mainstream games.I use it mostly for MS Excel. It ships with a low profile heat sink and fan that perform OK. I may buy a better low-profile heatsink and fan for it if I can\u2019t keep cpu temperatures below 175\u00b0 f in my poorly ventilated, tight-fitting custom case.The i5 10400 got sort of poor reviews against the lower priced AMD competitor. The i5 10600 appears to derive its awesome performance from over-clocking.The i5 10500 performed close to a stock-clocked i5 10600, but without the $100 price jump. I won\u2019t be needing to overclock; so, this is awesome for my needs.", "verified_purchase": true}]}
